In this session, we sought to reflect on the systems at play in our worlds that play a role in shaping our reproductive destiny.  We noted how the ancient practice of choosing one's reproductive destiny has become so foreign.  Due to the multitude of entities invested (even only partially) in controlling a woman's reproduction -- pharmaceutical companies, local/state/national governments (laws!!), schools, religious bodies, culture, husbands, fathers, doctors, teachers, etc -- it is a daunting task to seek autonomy.  The interplay between doctors, pharmaceutical companies, and governments alone should make any one skeptical of the treatment they are receiving.  But is there even an alternative?  As a group, we reflected on our own infrastructure related to our reproductive health -- do we trust the entities at play?  For some, there are strict laws preventing abortion, for example.  For others, the laws were more lenient but came with a list of caveats.  Who can you trust and what are your options?  Rather than fighting all of these powers at play, we realize we can arm ourselves with knowledge.  Knowing our own bodies that we are typically so alienated from, is the first step towards sovereignty.  We also must understand our own needs as individuals and as communities.  We found commonalities between stories shared within the group (from around the world), but so much is different.  Through the discussion we realized that the work must be done at a the hyper-local level because context matters.  At the end of our discussion, GynePunks gave an inspirational preview to some of the tools they've created in order to take power over their bodies and reproductive sovereignty.</p>", u'post_id': 34452, u'date': u'2018-01-12 00:35:02'}, {u'user_id': 3992, u'title': u'Really looking forward to your presentation, and to ', u'comment_id': 38197, u'content': u'<p>Really looking forward to your presentation, and to exchanging about reproductive health initiatives in different places.</p>', u'post_id': 34452, u'date': u'2017-10-12 21:18:43'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'Hello @liz_biospherex, sorry I missed your proposal, catching ', u'comment_id': 36216, u'content': u'<p>Hello <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/liz_biospherex">@liz_biospherex</a>, sorry I missed your proposal, catching up on my reading about biosphere now <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>Meet <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/natalia_skoczylas">@natalia_skoczylas</a> !

As for me, I gradually disengaged from the formal activities of <a href="http://www.armenianredwoodproject.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Armenian Redwood Project </a>(ARP) since it moved to a more bureaucratic and administrative sphere\xa0that I was not very comfortable dealing with, compared to the field work I have been doing for over a year, and currently I am only writing content and helping with field work. ARP has now teamed up with other agencies to work on a project of\xa0offering housing to the refugees with a lease, so that instead of paying rent they can pay for it monthly and own the apartment after a few years. As you know ARP has been subsidizing the rent of the refugees for the past couple of years.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays I\'m juggling a few projects, all of them are important causes I care for and I wrote case studies about during the Futuremakers project\xa0- I\'m managing a social enterprize <a>Sunchild Eco Tours\xa0</a>\xa0and the Eco Lodge\xa0in the only privately owned nature reserve in the Caucasus - <a href="http://www.fpwc.org/caucasus-wildlife-refuge/" rel="nofollow noopener">the CWR</a>, organizing\xa0events and <a href="http://www.ica.am/residency.php" rel="nofollow noopener">the AiR program</a> in <a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/future-makers-case-studies-adventures/institute-for-contemporary-arts">the Institute for Contemporary Arts </a>in Yerevan AND working on my own art project <a href="https://www.facebook.com/anush.babajanyan/posts/10153858970905563:0" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>The Return: Environmental Portraits of the Syrian Refugees in Armenia</strong></a> together with my friend and a talanted\xa0photographer Anush Babajanyan of <a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/4-plus-documentary-photography-center/4548">4Plus Photography</a>.

Basically Syria was/still is considered the stronghold of Christianity in the region due to the Armenian population living there. Because of The Syrian Civil War, most of the Armenians would leave Syria and move to either Europe/North America or UAE(if they had relatives there and could afford the trip), otherwise they would come to Armenia as their homeland. The ones who still stay in Syria are either so poor they can not afford to move or they have properties that they can not sell and are afraid to leave risk having them robbed and vandalized, so currently the estimate of the remaining population of the Armenian community in Aleppo is approx. 5000 people.</p>\n\n<p>The sad reality is that the ones that do come to Armenia eventually (intend to) leave the country as they fail to integrate, find jobs and affordable housing though in the last 5 years you can feel their presence in Yerevan a lot: food joints serving delicious stuff that was once considered exotic and rare, good customer service(as in all post-sovietic countries it was non-existent in Armenia), new available services, diversity in many fields, etc</p>\n\n<p>This is a once in a lifetime chance for Armenia to improve and progress...we will never again have a chance to receive such human capital (over 17 000 people with different skills and professions, most of whom speak Armenian) coming to Armenia voluntarily, that is able to boost the local economy, bring diversity and change that is so needed here. However we are failing at providing the essential care needed for these people to resettle and start a new life here, so sadly, if we do not act, we are going to lose almost all of them.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Officials are proudly reporting that we do not have tented camps like elsewhere and that the Syrian refugees in Armenia are taken care of and have lots of advantages but it is not enough. Even if they manage to find accommodation and a job, the salary is not enough for them to pay the rent and live a decent life (this is a problem for the locals as well, that is why every second person has a relative sending them money from abroad), the process of integration of students at school is non-existent(the Syrian-Armenians speak a different dialect and some do not know how to read or write in Armenian), the medical care system also has lots of issues...overall there is no platform to coordinate the care services available for the refugees resulting in people being lost and nowhere to turn to for assistance.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.armenianredwoodproject.org/armenia/h4vie44t5rbjju71g47izqd3tfnsuu" rel="nofollow noopener">Here are some photos</a>.</p>\n\n<p>P.S.\xa0And we still got the issue of the Azerbaijan refugees who fled to Armenia after Sumgait massacres of 1988 who live in overcrowded dorms without any care..</p>', u'post_id': 5042, u'date': u'2015-11-27 00:00:47'}, {u'user_id': 8, u'title': u'Got a set of questions you want to focus on?', u'comment_id': 9308, u'content': u"<p>Wow.

As a researcher for the <a href="http://cmo.uqam.ca/" rel="nofollow noopener">LABCMO</a> (common Lab between Universit\xe9 Qu\xe9bec \xe0 Montr\xe9al and Universit\xe9 Laval), I am studying some makerspace in Qu\xe9bec. My interest in Biohacking is due to my background in biochemistry. But for my thesis my focus is Africa, that is why the topic is: <br>Influences des soci\xe9t\xe9s traditionnelles africaines sur la contribution des tiers-lieux de fabrication num\xe9rique au d\xe9ploiement de la modernit\xe9.<br>Enqu\xeate sur l\u2019organisation, les pratiques, les valeurs et les objets de 3 Fablabs du Burkina Faso, du Cameroun et du S\xe9n\xe9gal <br>The government support I am talking about here is : policies to frame community-science action ; encourage the broad adoption of these local initiatives inside the country. Only official communiqu\xe9 can change the life of many people. Then funding can be useful\u2026<br>In my context, international partnership is very helpful, because our Government doesn\u2019t support open science and does not seem aware of this field or it is not their priority. But 1) International Organisation used to choose government as the first partner\u2026like that, be sure all the support will not reach to the population. For me it is not the good partner to bring impact where it is needed. 2) International Organization don\u2019t know our realities. They don\u2019t take in consideration that even if you are working with a local collaborator, the traditional structure of African society (family, clan, tribe, ethnic) still has a big influence in our manner to think, manage and organize. 3) It is very easy for Africans in the diaspora to be in touch with international organization and get their support. But for those who cannot travel (it is the case for many leaders and members of Civil Society Organisation (CSO)) ; the international support happens randomly or never.    <br>Me, Mayor (lol)\u2026I am Cameroonian and 34 years old. I don\u2019t want to expose the political environment of  my country here. But for a few notes, our President has spent 35 years in power (older than me) ; officially multipartism exists, but the President party is like the unique ; be Mayor means join this Party. And frankly, I am not sure that I will feel comfortable in this system. That is why I work directly with the community through advice and education and my philosophy is that local developement can be ensured only directly with/and inside the community. To support my action I have created in 2010 this school (legal) <a href="http://www.zikulumarie-claire.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.zikulumarie-claire.com/</a>, with like 250 students every year. In this school I am doing formal education (nursery and primary) like that, I am training our future leader. I am doing informal and long life education through workshops and seminars, to empower people. I am also doing hygiene sensibilisation, with my mother, who is a retired nurse, we used to run this course : EVA (Education \xe0 la Vie et \xe0 l\u2019Amour), for sexual hygiene. <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/noemi">@noemi</a>  I have too much to tell, but through these actions, I feel my impact more tangible and authentic than to be mayor under this system. Perhaps one day, if the system change.<br>All these reasons explain why I took the decision to do my research in Open Science and particularly DIY ; technology is a good way for communities to ensure themselves their own local development. That is why in December I will launch inside my community, one <a href="http://www.livingknowledge.org/science-shops/about-science-shops/" rel="nofollow noopener">science shop</a> combined with a lab, for the rapprochement science-society. <br>Definitely, I really want to join you in Brussels and share with you.

Whenever organisations start to build additional shelters, or do maintenance/repairs the locals get heavily involved. At the moment we aren't allowed to bring large-scale building material onto the site so resourceful communities and individuals are doing a lot of self building using scavenged wood and tarpualin/waterproof fabrics.

You aren't 'thick' in my ", u'comment_id': 39001, u'content': u'<p>Hi, Alberto!  You aren\'t \'thick\' in my opinion, and obviously I should be able to make a more coherent story for you (all). Indeed with the microbio \'plating\' methods, we only can count the bugs that grow under the given conditions of nutrients and temperature and oxygen and pH etc...  This is why we try to talk about \'colony forming units\' in the stricter analyses. Never are we able to get a number of everything that was in our original water sample...  Another project from Hackuarium, the Water Drop DNA project (that has the \'explorer\' Mike Horn as a sponsor!) does try to find out all the things in a water sample -through DNA analyses - but that method doesn\'t give a real number of how many of each bug is represented in the sample (and can also include things that aren\'t even alive!) ! <br>I don\'t think, however, that there are any p-value probabilities on the sheet. Just the counts (usually gross estimates) and one average and standard deviation (that shows the variance) for the one sampling site for which we had 3 plates...<br>However, I will try attach a graph that shows 95%-iles for some similar analyses...<br>It is very worth talking about this though, because what the probability shows is only valid in comparison to the controls.  You start out with the so called \'null hypothesis\' (i.e. there is no difference in bacterial abundance between sampling sites and tap water) and if the P value when you compare the averages is very low, that means you can reject this null hypothesis, and say there is indeed a significant difference in bacterial abundance between sampling sites from these data.<br>So from the example graph, that I need to upload next, where these 95%iles all overlap, there is no significant difference in bacterial abundance, but (usually the rule of thumb is that significant diffs should be at least 2standard deviations away from each other - we can talk about normal error bars another time, if you want! <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) the parts with a big peak not overlapping with others does differ significantly - at least statistically.<br>Which leads me to the next point:<br>The really crazy thing that is hard for people to grasp is that, even if your p&lt;&lt;0.01, there would still be a 1% chance that the difference you observed with your data <em>is</em> simply due to chance.<br>yep.<br>This is why there is a re-thinking of many old data based only on p=0.05 with low n numbers (this is why using 5 plates would be better than 3 plates, too, if you can manage it, to provide a concrete example of how to try to get around these problems).<br>This is also why really using the \'control data\' is important! <br>In our case, we can ask, for instance, how many times does the tap water give no bacteria? In fact, we were basically really screwed because we had tons of colonies even from the tap water samples, and should have included non-inoculated plates in the DIY (box in the bathtub!) incubation!  <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/joy.png?v=3" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"><br>There is a great quote I will find about this to include too!<br>ok, got, it - I actually took it from George Elliot\'s book Daniel Deronda, but says that in Aristotle\'s \'poetics\' he wrote (also quoting someone else!):<br>\'\'This too is probable, according to that saying of Agathon: \'It is a part of probability that many improbable things will happen.\' \'\'</p>\n\n<p>Just to re-iterate in terms of probabilities: the P value shows the probability that what you observe could have happened simply due to chance.  If P values are low enough, you are allowed to reject that null hypothesis and say there does seem to be a real difference between the different samples.  However, there is still another important issue: this whole exercise never \'proves\' anything, in the way you can have some mathematical proof, or the way the media says - this study proves xyz!<br>never!<br>In fact, the true scientific method can only \'disprove\' something (i.e. to say, these are not the same!)! <br>&amp; a new experiment with better controls and more statistical power can sometimes turn all beliefs upside down.<br>I love the idea that in the last decade so many things are being realised as quite important - microbes are part of us (10^14 of them vs 10^13 of \'ourselves\'), our neurons aren\'t forever and \'baby\' ones come into our brains from stem cells, DNA is repaired (but better to avoid damage, still) - these are just 3 things that are game changers.<br>I started my serious academic work, working with retroviruses, that showed that an old dogma of molecular biology (DNA-&gt;RNA-&gt;protein) is wrong - RNA-&gt;DNA too!  And now with microRNAs, and more (RNA helping repair DNA), the RNA life hypothesis isn\'t just for explaining evolution, but is an important current thing in all living cells - crucial in my ideas about dynamic genomic integrity.<br>But I will try to get back to the point (though I could go on and on, and would love to hear other\'s ideas and thoughts!!)! <br>I am sorry that because of our weak data, with smears and few replicates, we can\'t say there is a real difference in bacterial populations from our water sampling!<br>Still, nonetheless, I am convinced that we had one good result - no E.coli observed in the tap water samples - so little likelihood that raw sewage was there, unlike for the Leopold park samples...<br>hip hip hooray! ?? <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/confounded.png?v=3" title=":confounded:" class="emoji" alt=":confounded:"><br>I got a little deeper into statistics a couple of years ago in a MOOC course, and know that we would all benefit from more awareness of these issues.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you have a great weekend!</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/52c2c22752f2ad899f02192eeb635f7cca5b8f54" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/5/52c2c22752f2ad899f02192eeb635f7cca5b8f54.jpg" class="lightbox" title="MontreuxSites95percs2016.jpg"><img src="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/52c2c22752f2ad899f02192eeb635f7cca5b8f54_1_690x582.jpg" width="690" height="582"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">MontreuxSites95percs2016.jpg</span><span class="informations">1709x1442 559 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>', u'post_id': 38825, u'date': u'2017-11-04 06:39:48'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u"Sorry, @rachel, I still don't get it (ignore ", u'comment_id': 38999, u'content': u'<p>Sorry, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/rachel">@rachel</a>, I still don\'t get it (ignore me if I\'m being too thick).

(In the end all the values are calculated to know the average number of original cells in 100ml of a given sample.)<br>Then, the other important thing to grasp is that each microbial colony seen the next day on the plates (containing millions of cells after the overnight growth) represents of a single original cell from the sample, that has replicated in a certain spot of the plate -  we call these \'colony forming units\' because it is likely that there are lots of cells that actually don\'t make colonies (because they don\'t like the nutrients or the temperature or other parameters...).  In fact the purple \'Levine plates\' contain bile salts that prevent a whole class of abundant bacteria from growing (gram+ ones, if this means anything to you). This helps us look for ones of interest, esp our \'bioindicator\' for untreated sewage, <em>E. coli</em>, which allows us to think that tons of other unknown things (enteroviruses, micropollutants) are also probably in the sampled water.<br>Of course, very importantly, one can\'t just sample without comparing to something or another, and generally there is always a positive control (here in Switzerland, we have used river water or even sometimes toilet water - I still meant to talk with the other Alberto more about how rivers are full of bugs... <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> sadly...)  and a negative control, ordinarily tap water.<br>Finally, you need to have confidence that your plates themselves are not going to just randomly have lots of things growing - an uninoculated control!  This was something we really lacked last week!  With the plates just freshly poured at La Serre, there were many possibilities for sources of contam, like the droppers we used to inoculate the plates with the water samples. Finally, the plates normally should have some time to lose excess water, otherwise the colonies can be smeary and very hard to distinguish one from another...<br>One other variable is the treatment of the sample.  Ordinarily the rule is, after sampling, the tube must be kept in the cold and plated within 5 hours.  Our tubes, perhaps, were not entirely sterile, and they were just carried around and left until we did the plating after dinner...<br>Ask more questions if this is not clear.<br>I will put an image up showing a collection of plates from one of our sampling days this last summer.  (we had another special plate, termed \'chromogenic\' that allows one to distinguish at least 4 kinds of bacteria, and even a fluorescent substrate that confirms <em>E.coli</em> - pics of this are in the prezi...)<br>Then, as you say, we ultimately want counts that give numbers that we can use for statistical tests, like the T-test...<br>For these tests though, you need at least 3 samples averaged to compare.<br>However, we only had one set of 3 plates with counts, and their variance was so high, not much could be said, esp without an average of 3 from controls to compare against!</p>\n\n<p>Counting more than once is another good option, and we could have attempted that - actually we still could using some pictures!  But, because of the problem of the negative controls full of colonies (but at least not E. coli), we would still have a very difficult time drawing meaningful conclusions.  The crazy incubation in the bathtub also meant that the plates were not only super smeary, but a couple only had saran wrap as a cover, and got squashed!  Also one could imagine bacteria floating on water droplets to cause all our negative controls to have so many colonies (if it wasn\'t the droppers we used or the tubes we collected the samples in, which were left at RT too long...)!</p>\n\n<p>Quantitative biology is coming of age now, I should note - tons of old papers that relied on stats p&lt;0.05 are now realised to be completely underpowered and with non-reliable conclusions.</p>\n\n<p>I am happy you asked some probing questions!<br>Have a great Sunday!!</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of plates from one week\'s sampling last summer.<br>The positive controls have lots of colonies, the negative controls almost none, and the regional samples (from Lake Geneva around Montreux Bay) have varying amounts.  To note, 0.5ml was put on the positive controls, and unknowns here had 4ml per plate inoculated.  Again, in the end you make the numbers per 100ml (as in Alberto Rey\'s Bagmati graphics...)!<br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/f82ffa172e60e94ffe165423f9ebf25e6f5f16c3" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f82ffa172e60e94ffe165423f9ebf25e6f5f16c3.jpg" class="lightbox" title="MCBP3plates.jpg"><img src="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f82ffa172e60e94ffe165423f9ebf25e6f5f16c3_1_690x487.jpg" width="690" height="487"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">MCBP3plates.jpg</span><span class="informations">2479x1753 2.56 MB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>Here is the summary I made already, with a few extra things:<br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/01f64f724a0b2db33d255703ea49bd104e6f2941" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/0/01f64f724a0b2db33d255703ea49bd104e6f2941.jpg" class="lightbox" title="edgerydermicrobioAttempt.jpg"><img src="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/01f64f724a0b2db33d255703ea49bd104e6f2941_1_689x487.jpg" width="689" height="487"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">edgerydermicrobioAttempt.jpg</span><span class="informations">2480x1752 2.24 MB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>', u'post_id': 38825, u'date': u'2017-10-29 08:39:03'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Ok, I am not sure I can interpret ', u'comment_id': 38864, u'content': u'<p>Ok, I am not sure I can interpret those results.

Dealing with key questions our modern societies and economies are up against. The role of community is becoming more and more important for moving on from a mainly individualistically shaped society. A few days ago I watched the BBC Doco "The age of self" and was struck again by how important our work here in Nieklitz and in all the other communities and projects around the world is. Long story short: I wanna come and would like to contribute with some input or workshop. I have a solid background in natural building, especially in building Earthships and could give an input on Earthship technology, the global movement and about social dynamics/personal growth potential in practical building workshops. I also could give an input on the Wir bauen Zukunft project, our approach to develop a project community and what we\'ve learned so far.

These are children from underprivileged contexts, people with physical or mental disabilities etc. A while back we planned to teach long term hospitalized children, but sadly it did not go through. Our added value is being able to translate modern or complex science into fun and instructive activities suited for the target audience and their context. Maybe this can be the start of a further conversation.</p>\n\n<p>A group we have a hard time reaching is children with a migration background, especially those that are "fine for the system". They are not "doing bad enough" to be accompanied by specialized organisations, but by any measure they have a disadvantage that shows in their grades and ultimately how they enter society as young adults. There are many children from from Northern Africa here, and we have noticed that they need role models that they can relate to. Perhaps this is also something we can talk about.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, of course, I agree our health care system needs some serious reform.

Surely, it is vital to help people both to engage with each other and get to know each other well...

It\'s not other people\'s responsibility, it\'s ours as and when we feel that calling in us. But also ... but also ... we can support each other to step up, and that, I think, is where the culture of the community (or the culture set in a gathering) can make a lot of difference. Many of us (I definitely include myself) need some kind of support to step up. And I\'m pretty sure that there are some people I could offer support to for them to be able to step up.

This: in a diverse group of people with fairly aligned values, but very different practices, we look up, not down. We focus on the smartest, hardest working, most generous. We are awed by their vision and courage. At some level, we know these people do not represent the middle ground of our community, but its very best; and yet we cannot avoid feeling like "we should step up".

We were so busy just trying to make things work! And now suddenly people are asking us to hold workshops and seminars and masterclasses. They want us to teach them. And we are just barely keeping it together! But it makes some kind of sense, because when I look around I see sloppy thinking, bad work and business ethics, lack of rigour.

The technology is secondary. Your posts here suggest that attention to the detail in the process is much more significant than, say, the difference between using a domestic pressure cooker rather than an official autoclave for sterilization.</p>\n\n<p>There\'s something here too that is shared between citizen science and open source software. It is that it is quite easy in principle to involve ordinary people in ordinary situations, without great amounts of expensive technology or large organisations.</p>\n\n<p>Back to schools, though. How can we get these ideas, and practices, into mainstream secondary education? Perhaps through, first, alternative education and home schoolers sharing resources? If we did manage to get into mainstream education, that would be such a powerful springboard into the hearts and minds of young people. </p>\n\n<p>In the UK, we can perhaps benefit in an unexpected way from present trends. There are still large numbers of standard council-controlled schools, but increasing numbers of free schools and "academies".

Because I really would like to get more people doing citizen science, and especially help them become aware of how easily we might be able to help our cells avoid too much damage, also for future generations, I guess one personal thing I (re)learned was how difficult it is to push ideas onto people directly.  Even if they seem very nice.  For one example, many times I would have liked to advice people to skip their cigarette break (since cigarette smoke not only can directly damage DNA but prevent its repair!), but I guess there was only one person that I even pointed this out to (very gently, I think)...  I believe people have an idea that there are so many bad things out there, that one more makes no big difference, and of course adults are allowed to make their own choices.  Nonetheless, I hope that if they could really understand \'why\' such things are bad for us all, and the environment - based on this idea of \'dynamic genomic integrity\' getting disrupted, things could change for the better...

Maybe then family isn\'t quite the right word for  "chosen family" if it doesn\'t include that level of commitment.  Deep medical care requires commitment and often a lot of financial resources.  Coming together to live for an unspecified time, doing work projects together and other deep involvements still generally do not include the level of commitment that generally comes with one\'s blood family, at least not in the long arc of one\'s life.  Even when members of a blood family don\'t get along that well, I think there is still in most cases one\'s best chance of getting serious care compared to a circle of support or a chosen family if one doesn\'t have the resources to afford it for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Unless that commitment is stated and agreed to, not unlike a marriage..."in sickness and in health."  I have known that kind of commitment with people not in my blood family.

We didn't pay attention to our own bodies screaming at us. </p>\n\n<p>For us, it is imperative to understand new ways of caring for one another that can be practically applied for groups. It is one thing to critique the existing system and to talk about what else is needed, but it is another thing entirely to actually make shit together and try it out. That's what we're trying to do.

It isn\'t for "fixing" migranes, but it showed me the things I\'ve been doing wrong and gave me some tools that, to be honest, I haven\'t been utilizing properly.

The issues you\'ve highlighted are fundamental to creating organisations that generate health as well as other forms of value. I\'m really curious about the link between your involvement in CIN &amp; anxiety level. I\'m guessing there are clues there that relate to the theme I\'m exploring - the conditions that generate health within our organisations. It sounds like these conditions are generating ill health.<br>I see this as connected to the issue of balancing the needs of the individuals and the needs of the collective/group/org and collaborating around strategies so that a broader range of these are met while at the same time its true that its not often feasible to meet all needs at all times. Greater attention paid to needs as a normal part of our operations would be one way forward. <br>I\'m also interested in how we might create organisational structures that are much more capable of functioning <em>around</em> individuals ability to function. The organisation I work for receives many referrals who are skilled and talented people who aren\'t able to hold down paid work because of health issues of various kinds. Yet often what they want <em>more than</em> \'help\' is contexts where they feel their skills are valued, where they can contribute when they are able and find support when they are not. Often this means not having someone trying to \'fix you\' and perpetually asking if you\'re okay which can just draw your attention to how \'not ok\' you\'re feeling. At one point we considered implementing a badge system - to indicate to others our internal state - a kind of \'leave me alone - its enough to know you\'re there\'.<br>But we haven\'t done that and we are only able to take people as referrals or as volunteers which feels like it falls short.<br>Thank you for bringing such a personal and interesting dimension to this discussion.

I often find myself during my low days ignoring people entirely (it\'s especially different when I\'m not needed to be face to face which often affects my mood and ability to engage.) It\'s been a liability for much of the way I\'ve organized my projects and I haven\'t found a good way to manage.

I once went to 5 different therapists and they all thought I needed some work, one claimed I was bipolar and should be on drugs. So I went to a spiritual/life coach/philosopher/trained therapist dude, he said my energy was too high and I wasn\'t grounded enough to be able to channel it well - hence the highs and the crashing. I worked with him for a while - much of what I worked on in those days was to be grounded and accept what was happening without desire for any other states. I became quite neutral and my loops ended. I also felt inanimate, the whole point of lithium was to avoid those states. So I stopped and here we are in loopy days again.

Ethics and data protection in citizen science project, however, are not easily classified as H1, H2 or H3. No one seems to care. Data stewardship is normally dismal. Many projects (of any kind, not speaking about citizen science in particular) are playing cowboy. In all this, H1 requires compliance, this is true. But compliance is not where the action is. The action is in self-motivated actions to do things in fairness (in ethnics) and steward the datasets that people helped build together (in data protection). </p>\n\n<p>So, you can take action because H1 demands it as a condition to fund your citizen science project (H1): in this case you will just tick boxes. You can do it to stay fundable, but while you are at it improve your practices a bit (H2-). You can do it mainly to improve your practices, and it\'s great that you get extra fundability (H2+); or you can do it because you believe that a world that puts ethics and data stewardship in research is fundamentally different from one that consumes people and data and moves on (H3). In practice, in H2-, H2+ and H3 you will be doing the same things, at least initially, because conditions in H1 are so poor.</p>', u'post_id': 6479, u'date': u'2017-07-30 13:13:41'}, {u'user_id': 3613, u'title': u'This discussion could easily constitute multiple session proposals ', u'comment_id': 33828, u'content': u'<p>This discussion could easily constitute multiple session proposals rather than just one! I caught it last week but I\u2019m coming to a response late from other things. I don\u2019t know anything about GDPR or much about data protection in general but the discussion touches on a number of topics that interest me; policy re-designed as a tool for a networked and complex world and what Illich would refer to as the \u2018radical monopoly\u2019 that our procurement systems create. </p>\n\n<p>But it\u2019s another of Illich\u2019s concepts that seems to be the thread running through this conversation - the systemic problems that arise from growing institutionalisation. As Marco mentions \u201c<em>bureaucracy tries to optimise for one model</em>\u201d and for me this is the nub. It is entirely unsuited to operating within systems thinking perspectives and perhaps this is what is called for beyond creating multiple models.</p>\n\n<p>Systems account for and allow a greater degree of variation and adaption unlike as you say, bureaucracy that seeks to encourage standardisation because this is one of the conditions it needs to operate. This is also how I would understand why institutions can\u2019t replicate bottom up approaches <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/markomanka">@markomanka</a> - they are founded in two completely different <em>operating systems</em> to use Winnie\u2019s term. It strikes me that the ethics training of Mandarins that <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/alberto">@alberto</a> mentions facilitated operation in a living system - and therefore able to cope with the infinite variations that played out across Imperial China. Ethics and data protection compliance are the symptoms in this context but to my mind, the underlying malaise is hyper-institutionalisation.</p>\n\n<p>I also see another dilemma unfolding in the discussion that may be helpful to tease out. There would appear to be an inherent tension not just in this thread but also within Edgeryders itself between responding to immediate needs and contributing to generative creation of  completely new approaches and responses. For example there is some necessity in meeting immediate needs of those undertaking Opencare work -  to pull in resources to support their work or to understand the implications of future changes such as compliance. At the same time, there is a pull - to work on the \u2018long shots\u2019, the longer term, bigger impact projects that <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/winnieponcelet">@winnieponcelet</a> mentions. </p>\n\n<p>A frame I\u2019ve found useful is <a href="http://www.internationalfuturesforum.com/three-horizons">Three Horizons</a>. Briefly: Horizon One (H1) is the dominant system, business as usual. Horizon Three (H3) for me represents a different paradigm - or a completely new way of doing things. Horizon Two (H2) is the space of innovation and this can go two ways: either prolong H1 (H2-) or open up H3 (H2+). It strikes me that Edgeryders and OpenCare are operating across all three horizons. Horizon One has been outlined in the proposition for OpenCare as rising health care costs and care systems struggling to meet demand. In exploring DIY welfare, OpenCare researches activity that falls into H2 stretching into H3. I\u2019m not totally clear yet whether the underlying goal for OpenCare is H2-; that is enabling the current way of doing things simply to function better or H2+/H3 - paving the way for the \u2018completely new\u2019?</p>\n\n<p>So in this discussion there are the immediate H1 needs of projects to sustain their work. What role does OpenCare (or might a session at OV) play in meeting these needs? But beyond this is there also a role to call for structural changes that get to the root of the problem? And this is where we hit up against mutually exclusive sets of interests.

What is the role of government? The \'operating system\' plays a major role... It\'s almost\xa0absurd to expect a\xa0bureaucrat doing full time bureaucracy work to speak the language, know the needs etc. of projects that are relevant. Yet if the bureaucrat spends more time on oversight and less on command &amp; control, leaving the latter to the people who have experience in the field, it\'s probably more effective and\xa0cheaper.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I\'ve been thinking about in the context of Open Insulin. Leaving aside if Open Insulin is the right approach, consider any project that is a long shot, ambitious and with a potential big impact on many parts of the world. It\'s hard to disagree (in my opinion) with long shots for systemic changes in eg. pharma industry, based on ethics. I haven\'t met anyone who is against it\xa0<em>in principle</em>, also not in government.</p>\n\n<p>Though only a smaller part of such an impact is realised in the city where the project resides. In my experience, a city wants to support projects that have an impact in their city, the impact beyond that is of minor importance. Or, more extreme, they will deliberately not\xa0support you so that you go search funding up the chain, such as regional grant, because that results in an inflow of money into the city from elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Not so popular to be funded by the city, due to the above, but also because they would\xa0rather support projects with an\xa0<em>immediately\xa0visible </em>impact, such as helping disadvantaged children or establishing a development aid link with an African town. This is of course great, but it is a form of symptom treatment, and for the cynical, mainly about the funder\'s next election cycle. Policy now seems more about\xa0adding new rules and exceptions to help very specific groups who have been disadvantaged, rather than taking ambitions decisions that address the root and affect everyone - from the same disadvantaged to the shrinking group of privileged people - to change the legacy of outdated rules. It should be a balance, naturally, but it\'s way skewed to the wrong side now.</p>\n\n<p>A trick is to tie some concrete city level impact to the project - I guess OpenRampette would be a good example. Yet this is not always possible, especially in more complex projects.</p>\n\n<p>Higher up there\'s also close to no room for eg. an Open Insulin\xa0in more formal and bigger funding programs. Rigid structures, but also lots of lobbying going on from, in the case of Open Insulin, big pharma. There, your chances are tiny and attempts are expensive. Ping <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/lucy">@Lucy</a> , maybe you can also pitch in.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I see potential in the role of the city, just because there seems to be more room to be creative for those who dare. These long shot projects are not expensive in money either, especially considering the potential outcome. If five girls &amp; guys in their garage can have a shot at changing an industry, imagine what a city could do.\xa0How badass would it be to read in the newspaper: "The city of Milan supports open source treatment for diabetes induced blindness".</p>\n\n<p>So should a city support what emerges in their city, even if the impact is proportionately realised mainly outside the city? Considering they are dead in the water\xa0elsewhere, is it <em>ethical</em>\xa0not to support these projects at a city level?</p>', u'post_id': 6479, u'date': u'2017-07-20 13:36:00'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Like this', u'comment_id': 33391, u'content': u'<p>It latches nicely onto work we are doing on a different project, witn UNDP: <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/hasmik">@Hasmik</a> , <span class="mention">@gazbia-sorour</span> , <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/tinatin">@Tinatin</a> , <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/inge">@Inge</a> , <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/max_perry">@Max_Perry</a> , <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/lilitmidoyan">@LilitMidoyan</a> ...\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The topic is different from care: we are looking at bottom-up urbanism, city-as-a-wiki etc. But it is still community-based, and seeks to empower community capability and enable it towards public good goals. This is very hard for local governments to do, because giving communities space requires, paradoxically, for them to behave in a way that might appear arbitrary. Why are we letting people do things in this park, but not that square over there? Because the people who are interested in this park are aligned with the spirit of contribution to public good,\xa0<em>and</em>\xa0they\xa0have capability to deliver. Who says so? We do. This is the polar opposite of <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/matteo">@Matteo</a> \'s "strict rules often lead to standard, controlled and predictable output": if you, as a government,\xa0open yourself to bottom-up innovation you pay a price in terms of strict rules.</p>\n\n<p>In David Graeber\'s book on debt there is an aside that stayed with me, and might solve the policy maker\'s dilemma. It is well known that Imperial China invented bureaucrats. The Mandarins were civil servants, centrally selected on the basis of merit and centrally trained. But they were not given a rulebook to apply. China is big, and communications were poor and slow; also, it was very unstable, with peasant revolts sprouting out every year.\xa0The Emperors knew that Mandarins would be on their own in distant provinces, and they would need to take quick action to prevent and quell revolts. So, they were trained in Confucian ethics rather than "law" as we understand it, and instructed to do their best to make sure the people were content and did not starve.</p>\n\n<p>In modern terms, their operating mode was result-oriented rather than process-oriented, and buttressed by ethics rather than rules. I think Amartya Sen\'s work shows that this would be enough to ensure accountability. Which means, governments could, in principle, be hierarchical\xa0<em>and</em>\xa0creative\xa0<em>and</em>\xa0accountable. But that\'s not easy to do in process-oriented, formalistic legal systems and cultures.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Is this something we could be discussing?

And perhaps distribution hubs at a neighborhood scale.</p>\n\n<p>First and foremost things must make sense at a micro level, and can then be minimally tweaked to also make sense as part of a bigger whole.

Thank you for sharing, thank you for doing. </p>\n\n<p>So I\'m coming from an aligned perspective when it comes to care, in that I think that toxic power dynamics are central to the brokenness of intimate and systemic relationships of care. Some of the ways in which I\'ve been thinking through and practicing this refer to certain post-feminist, queer and decolonial approaches. I\'ve been thinking that if we can start with shifting our very psychoanalytic experience of the Self and Other, that if we begin relating through what I call an "expanded self" or what Bracha Ettinger calls the "matrixial borderspace," then we might be able to address the root of these issues. I have much more to say on this... will you be at the OpenVillage festival? Perhaps we can share more in person. In any case, you may like to look at the work of Bracha if you\'re not yet familiar with it - very high theory but beautiful in the ways it pushes beyond the patriarchal model of psychoanlaysis.</p>\n\n<p>What I\'ve come to realise however is that my philosophical and practice-based explorations are limited in how they can address wider immediate care needs and will take a long time to unfold. This is what I appreciate about what you\'re doing! Is that you\'re translating these ideas into a tangible accountability model for health. I\'m not sure I understand it in its entirety, and yet another reason I hope we can talk more!</p>', u'post_id': 826, u'date': u'2017-10-11 09:15:34'}, {u'user_id': 3589, u'title': u"Hello Thom,\n\nThanks for your reply.

We can testify to that with our lab: it takes a lot of work, especially when what you do is relatively obscure. Then getting people to actually <em>care</em> is harder still. On the other hand, painting a rosy picture, using buzzwords and rubbing shoulders with those who have the means to take your project to the next level can also be toxic.

Not sure if it\'s allowed, but we should ask if a demo is allowed (not the actual fishing). The distance is a problem: a one hour round trip doesn\'t fit the schedule. Public transport takes as long.

So the first thing is to check if you\'re aware of "<a href="http://tacticalurbanismguide.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">tactical urbanism</a>" and its approaches, as to my understanding this is one of the earliest iterations of community-led placemaking and has plenty of useful tools that could allow you to expand involvement in this project to broader collaborators if you wanted that..? </p>\n\n<p>As I\'m sure you\'re aware, there\'s an abundance of this kind of placemaking happening across the US and Canada and if you\'re not already across organizations like the <a href="https://www.pps.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Project for Public Spaces</a>, it\'s an absolute must. <a href="http://citiesforpeople.ca/en/about" rel="nofollow noopener">The Cities for People</a> initiative in Canada is also super interesting. (My apologies if I\'m sharing the obvious... I have plenty more references if you want them just hit me up). </p>\n\n<p>Recently, I\'ve been involved in some community consulting as a part of a new project that\'s bringing together diverse collaborators in Montreal\'s community development. It\'s called the <a href="http://listeningtomontreal.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Listening Platform</a> and is trying to address the way in which we listen and weave together to the abundance of voices involved in a cities evolution. I think it could be an interesting reference as Living Streets grows. One reason in particular is I\'m also left wondering how you are engaging the breadth of the communities in Ghent in this project - is it including socially-excluded communities or is it more a creative placemaking project? Over the years I\'ve collaborated with an amazing organization called the <a href="http://www.ds4si.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Design Studio for Social Intervention</a> (incubated out of MIT\'s urban engagement lab) and I continue to be inspired by how they use placemaking approaches to include and empower marginalized voices. Their <a href="http://www.ds4si.org/creativity-labs" rel="nofollow noopener">Creativity Labs</a> could be interesting for you too. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, that\'s a lot I know (and I haven\'t even touched on my masters yet! <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/grinning.png?v=3" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"> ) .

Getting to know one\'s neighbors is nice, but it is not about what we do in our free time, it is about how we work together to live a life in dignity. </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I wonder how a middle class project like this might undermine the trust of the wider (poorer) community in the ability of actually working together across class (\'race\', gender, sexuality, etc.).</p>', u'post_id': 33746, u'date': u'2017-10-09 10:09:28'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'Connection with FutureMakers', u'comment_id': 33786, u'content': u'<p>I could see early on how Pieter and Dries\'s experience connects with what UNDP are trying to do in FutureMakers - approaching cities and public spaces as experiments where communities could bring their contribution at the decision making table.

The approach resonates deeply with our own:</p>\n\n<p><em>Transition management does not seek to involve stakeholders or to represent a given population; it focuses on selecting change agents. However, any concept of selective involvement comes with tensions. For example, doubts can surface regarding democratic legitimacy. Making clear that transition management is not a decision-making process can assuage these: it creates a setting for mutual inspiration among societal actors, in which new ideas, connections, and actions can emerge.\xa0</em></p>\n\n<p>We also like to approach change as something that is <em>not</em> decision making. I in particular use a lot of biology-derived metaphors, like evolution or adaptation \u2013 we discussed this at length with your fellow Ghentian <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/winnieponcelet">@WinniePoncelet</a> .

For where there is hectic business, there is all the distraction, blindness and madness of this suicidal culture. This sense that \u201cthe time is now\u201d can be met by something present. Instead of putting that intense feeling into multiple short-lived projects, to make energy matter. To use energy with real intention. One way of spreading courage and alternatives is to be in total presence. What about an action that expressed a great slowing down into presence during the Open Village? Slowing down the pace of the streets with movement. Done a few things like this before - I led a slow motion walk up Oxford high street in the last decade to protest the Iraq war. So - what about a short workshop and then an action of dancing slowly (in whatever your style) in the streets? Gifting pieces of fruit to passers by? A way of spreading the invitation. I\'ve made mistakes in the past about acting before the time is ripe. Doing too much. In rushed ways. Not preparing long enough to really pull it off. There is a mastery to carpe diem - in plucking the day when it is ripe. If that can tie in with urban game you are working on - great - I\'m on for this &amp; looking out for times and places for this creative plan."<br><aside class="onebox whitelistedgeneric">\n  <header class="source">\n    <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/open-village-call-19-july-2017/6506/3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">edgeryders.eu</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class="onebox-body">\n    <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/user_avatar/edgeryders.eu/kate_g/200/1027_1.png" width="107" height="107" class="thumbnail">\n\n<h3><a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/open-village-call-19-july-2017/6506/3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Open Village Call 19 July 2017</a></h3>\n\n<p>Happy to read / proofread - though I\'m ever impressed by the succinct writing on edgeryders*.

This will help to shape your\xa0session in a way that will\xa0contribute to collective insights on this topic.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Theme: better understanding policy in context of a top-down system. Even good policies may be limited in their effectiveness - that is by the time they cascade down to the level of effect/impact they are often either diluted or do not produce the effects desired by the original intentions of the policy no matter how well meaning these might be.\xa0Another way to look at it would be this: living systems theory has turned on its head the Victorian world-view that imagined that unless mankind were imposing order from top down then chaos would ensue. The new sciences - nano biology, quantum theory - have revealed the extent to which order is a natural impulse (fractals\xa0being a beautify example) and that many of mankind\u2019s efforts to date have disrupted this impulse.</p>\n\n<p>So what does this say about policy? How do we understand more effective ways to enable our natural impulse as human beings to be caring and compassionate? How do we re-conceive of policies in the light of this - to support and not disrupt the collective impulse to help our fellow human beings?\xa0</p>\n\n<p>From this understanding - how do we understand the instruments and tools of the collective, of citizens - what do they look like in relation to health and social care? Equally, how do we understand the instruments and tools of the state (such as policy) - how can these be designed to enable the collective response that is the basis of welfare in traditional societies?</p>\n\n<p>The next question would then be how this might inform the nature of the session you\u2019d offer. It seems there\'s so much you could contribute for joint exploration.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>There seems to me to be a common thread in what I\u2019ve encountered of what you\u2019ve sent through. Its something about the format of the various happenings. e.g. Monastery, Galway Soup - that genuinely reflect values of welcome, bringing people in, shifting power, playing with stereotypical roles to create new experiences that have greater meaning - that get under the superficial. Does that make sense? And something about new recipes - the way you put together interesting elements to create new experiences/outcomes. Perhaps you\u2019d want to focus on one of the three thematics? Sharing what\u2019s really worked and using peer review (I\u2019m gathering that this is something ER are particularly keen on) to solve some things that aren\u2019t yet clear/sorted? Which of the three thematics connects most strongly to the health and social care? There\u2019s also the tiny houses &amp; homeless folks work you mentioned. Might this also be a possible session?\xa0</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ve so much good work to choose from - would a way forward be for you to suggest 2-4 possible sessions and we work up the one that has the best connection to the theme?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks\xa0</p>\n\n<p>/gehan</p>', u'post_id': 812, u'date': u'2017-06-23 13:38:51'}, {u'user_id': 3433, u'title': u'Watching things grow feeds the soul:)', u'comment_id': 20731, u'content': u'<p>Thanks, we\'ve had some struggles such as low volunteer numbers and consistancy of volunteers.

To ensure health and sustainability, you bake prevention/wellness activities into cultural programmes. So, a side effect of doing culture is (over time) a reduction in treatment of acute health conditions.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I am starting to think that this is where most of the impact of communities on care comes from.

If you are based in CT, then please do reach out I\'d love to meet with you and consider a conversation in person. I agree with you with regards to relaying information beyond academia and forging collaborations between academia and larger/broader audiences. This has been the preemptive step to the current project and various talks I\'ve had with various institutions.</p>\n\n<p>I agree that visual approaches bridge educational divides and somewhat diffuses jargon. This has assisted me in relaying scientific knowledge to other audiences. I\'ve been actively involved in collaboratively designing Events to this purpose, which not only provides knowledge in "digestable" means to community members, but are key for Scientists to observe as well. Each event has been learning for me, and I\'m now testing the efficacy of presenting data in a different manner in communities, i.e. arts, or fun interactive events within communities in a pop-up fashion.</p>\n\n<p>Langa has a very dynamic collaboration scene between artists and community members, as well as the private sector. It\'s a phenomenal community and I was assisting with a local tech-startup focused on providing community members with tech-training. Completely fascinating and I am trying to access various communities, as I find that given South Africa\'s current dynamic and transport restrictions communities tend to be territorial bound in its activities and collaborations.</p>\n\n<p>The Work with local CCWs is still a focus for the Sustainable Livelihoods Foundation, who I was employed by. I managed various projects using various participatory approaches to explore lived experience and provide an outlet for expression. One of our projects funded by the Making All Voices iniative sought to bring these issues faced by CCWs to the City governance structure. It was a phenomenal experience trying to track down CABS and Clinic Boards (whom only exist on paper). There is a network we found that are actively working for the benefit of CCWs, but gov has cut funding for this network and introduced a new structure that is completely defunct and has no community representation (based on my findings in 2016).</p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> you\'ve raised an important point. " How do these \'larger audience\'\xa0responds\xa0to new formats? What constitutes reaching results for you? More awareness?\xa0or more active behavior across the different community groups?"</p>\n\n<p>This is a trying question. In my personal work using participatory methods and facilitation, I\'ve found that audience members generally respond positively to these new formats, perhaps because it is visual and emotion-invoking. When producing the Digital stories and the Events with CCWs, we found people openly reacting to persons they see everyday and that they already know function within communities in a very different light. Suddenly we had a hall of persons speaking about CCWs, valuing them differently, wanting conversations, etc. Immediately support was forged. IN one meeting, I had a community member request the microphone and state <em>"If i only saw this video 6 months ago my friend would be alive. He would know what these people do in the community and I would understand what my friend is going through. He died because the TB medication made him sick and he didn\'t want to be sick like that so he stopped".\xa0</em></p>\n\n<p>Further to your question, each commuinty in CT alone, nevermind SA, responds to these formats differently as they each have a varied social dynamic on their own. So a one-size-fits-all simply does not work in this context, hence us wanting to test out methods that are relative to the communities we work in. Additionally, commuities (esp townships) suffer from very different public health concerns, e.g. in Delft the issue we worked on was cardiovascular disease as a majority of persons are suffering from this wheres the community 2 km from my called Vrygrond TB is the main concern. Language variation is a big issue as its not homogenous.</p>\n\n<p>I agree with <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/carolinem">@CarolineM</a> final comment. Generally, the response to these approaches have been favourable in very different settings. I\'ve only briefly touched on that in the township environment. However, when presenting the Collaborative Videos and the Photovoice booklet to an academic audience at the University of Stellenbosch Medical Campus, Scientists were overall positive and approached me for additional information. It appeared that many are "stuck" when it comes to Engagement. In conclusion, all audiences that were exposed to the project products were excited and saw the value in the packaging of information in various forms, and the difference in direct participation with varying parties in the design of those products.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The value for me lies in the intersection of these fields or knowledge bodies. and the relationships and collaborations forged. I am truly excited by this potentiality that remains on the fringes of studies and projects.</p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/carolinem">@CarolineM</a> \xa0If you are based in CT and have the time, please do reach out to me.

Between you and <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> I feel inspired to test these methods more rigorously and I am actively seeking collaborations with persons interested in similar thematic areas.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Wow <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/winnieponcelet">@WinniePoncelet</a> <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/niekd">@NiekD</a> . Unforunately I do not have a name of the Belgian researcher but I have been working on very similar themes in Cape Town when employed by a local org\xa0. I focused very much on the Health Impact pillar of the organization, which adopted a participatory approach in its educational programmes. I managed 2 projects for the org that focused on Community Care Workers who were primarly the ground fighters for TB and HIV. We used Digital Story telling, Theatre and Photovoice as methods for engagement which were very successful in relaying lived experience for the sake of education. I\'d be happy to share key learning. This video provides feedback from Community Care Works, and their reflections on the project:\xa0<a href="https://vimeo.com/180156715" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="https://vimeo.com/180156715" rel="nofollow noopener">https://vimeo.com/180156715</a> \xa0and this video features one Digital Story from a community resident:\xa0<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy1PHfUMCQY" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy1PHfUMCQY" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy1PHfUMCQY</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Our project on Cardiovascular disease, which I managed and lead all facilitation, used Photovoice as a methodology. It was phenomenal in highlighting illness, nutrition and general social dynamic in response to health. I\'d be happy to share this as well as the Photovoice booklet. Please note that even though I managed the project the book was developed by the org that employed me. <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/niekd">@NiekD</a> &amp; <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/scigrades">@Scigrades</a> grade, I think you may find this to be a interesting method that is participatory in all aspects of the design of the product. The following collaborative videos (a participatory method in itself in which a community develops their own video highlighting a specific issue/cause they\'ve isolated as important to develop:\xa0<a href="https://vimeo.com/186163072" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="https://vimeo.com/186163072" rel="nofollow noopener">https://vimeo.com/186163072</a>\xa0(Youth video focused on CVD) and\xa0<a href="https://vimeo.com/190529779" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="https://vimeo.com/190529779" rel="nofollow noopener">https://vimeo.com/190529779</a>\xa0(video developed by youth, elder populaton and Scientists collectively). Note that the youth developed a collaborative video and the adult population of the participants developed the Photovoice publication. We aimed to explore CVD from different generation\'s perspectives using differing tools. The adult population are community members that have kids or grandkids and have to consider them when purchasing, consuming or disposing of food, whereas the youth group were youth aged 18 - 28 that do not have to consider others when purchasing, consuming or disposing of food. If anyone is interested I\'d be keen to write up a post and post or email persons copies of the Photobook.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>And finally <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/winnieponcelet">@WinniePoncelet</a>, as these methods are very new and often hard to track scientifically I\'ve chosen to look at impact and direct KAP (knowledge, attitude and practice) changes. This is a near impossibility in its own. The way I\'ve sought to study the efficacy of drama as a method was to\xa0study variations of drama presentation including: deep characterization of characters; involving comedy in messages; shorter repetitive chanting or messaging in plays; plays in controlled environments to an invited, anticipating audience; pop up plays in local clinics to unsuspecting audiences. We interviewed persons with a set of questions focused on specific health messaging (i.e. TB and HIV focused) before and after plays.</p>\n\n<p>We then interviewed a select number of persons 3-5 months post-performance to gauge retained knowledge. This allowed us insight into which theatrical mechanisms allows message recall. I am yet to publish this paper (if only we had 2 extra hours per day).I aim to take a similar approach with the Street Arts project, although the project adopts an organic, reactive and culturally-/community-sensitive approach and may prove hard to collate. We will not control the public health concern that will be focused on in each country that the project will be installed. Instead, we will allow for this to come directly from the community as we wish to work with issues, define the project and define the artform\xa0in collaboration with community members. I wish to track this process, and treat this project as a prototype phase before scaling the project and inviting others as collaborators/partners in 2018.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I hope this provides you with some clarity.</p>\n\n<p>Please feel free to contact me on nabroe@gmail.com if needed. If enough persons are interested in an entry focused on Photovoice as a method, I\'d be glad to proceed.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 33730, u'date': u'2017-05-09 07:35:44'}, {u'user_id': 3362, u'title': u'Inspiring!', u'comment_id': 33787, u'content': u'<p>Thanks for sharing this <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/nabeel_p">@Nabeel_p</a> !

The main idea behind its development is that of enabling its use directly at people\'s homes, in order to allow intensive sessions directly in activities of daily living.\xa0As such, it could be used in several scenarios, from rehab to assistance. The main differentiator wrt such scenarios would/could (mainly) be the user-interface.</p>\n\n<p>In the simplest\xa0case, the device could be programmed (by a physician, physiotherapist etc.) in order to mimic/repeat a predefined set of motions over and over again in order, for example, to avoid the undesired consequences of limbs immobilization (contractures, poor blood circulation etc).</p>\n\n<p>In a rehab setting, for example post-stroke, the exoskeleton\'s motions could be derived by decoding user\'s intention via physiological signals (mainly EEG, EMG). In this case the basic idea would be to allow the user to complement or slowly re-gain control over his flaccid/weak arm and discontinue its use once the user does not need it any longer.</p>\n\n<p>In an assistive setting, for example post spinal cord injury or in myopathies, the exoskeleton\'s motions could be derived as before or chosen from a simple interface (e.g. smartphone, joysticks etc.) in order to provide assistance-as-needed, whenever the user wears\xa0the device.</p>\n\n<p>In a case like the one you\'ve mentioned the device could indeed be used, not to help but rather to (selectively) resist the movements. By customizing some parameters to the user\'s needs/residual abilities, one could enable\xa0specific trainings in order to work on specific ranges of motions, torques, joints/muscles combinations etc. Such parameters/programs could be also updated by a physician, or dynamically (by the device itself) by inferring correlates of muscle-fatigue, achievable range of motions etc.</p>\n\n<p>In all the previous scenarios, as specified by <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/noemi">@Noemi</a>, data related to the user\'s progress could be collected and analyzed, for the sake of monitoring and improving the therapy itself.</p>', u'post_id': 806, u'date': u'2017-01-22 17:34:37'}, {u'user_id': 3433, u'title': u'Thanks, @Noemi.

There is\xa0a shared open space in the middle, which is free of traffic and is usually filled in with things people chose: tables, barbecues, little gardens, ...</p>\n\n<p>The cit\xe9 where my sister lives is very lively. There are\xa0a lot of social interactions because people spend a lot of time outside, organise things together, borrow stuff, etc. Everyone knows everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, this is a lot less the case in the cit\xe9 right next to my sister\'s. People don\'t interact that much and the social ties aren\'t as rich. I\'m not sure what causes this, because the same basic elements are there. Does it come down to the people?

Sorry for the late reply as I was travelling and conferencing abroad.</p>\n\n<p>People in the biohacker community have criticized the DITOs project for not being very participatory towards the community. Mainly involving them through asking for free work or using their work without proper attribution. A big discussion around fair pay / fair play ensued and continued at the Global Community Bio Summit last week.</p>\n\n<p>Among other things, this seems to be tied to the bureaucratic nature of partners participating in large publicly funded projects. Money is going into managing and reporting on projects, rather than doing actual high impact work. Not sure if this is the case for DITOs, but surely you\'ve experienced it at some point.</p>\n\n<p>I do a lot of work around science, citizen engagement and education at a grassroots level. We do cool stuff and involve loads of people without any budget. A big contrast to certain several hundred thousand euro projects of which the output is meager in terms of quality and citizen involvement, as well as being dead in the water when funding ends. Browsing through past EU project websites often feels like walking through a graveyard, "Fun while it lasted" on the tombstones. On to the next funding round.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking to other community labs all over the world last week at the Bio Summit, I have the impression it is seeping into their organisations as well. I hear the old, establish labs talk about their \'executive directors\' and other roles that deal with (or add?) overhead and generally lower the cool stuff:cost ratio. Unavoidable when you grow in size, but definitely to be improved upon.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we are going through a growth phase with our own organisations, we absolutely want to maintain our cost efficiency. And importantly, fairly pay the people doing the actual work firstly.

And many people do not wish to have any of their resources going to anyone other than their family or who they specifically designate.  The issue of whether or not we are "our brother\'s keeper" is a debate with no end here in the land of the free, where you are free to succeed and free to fail.  And if you do fail, someone may or may not lend you a hand.  I, who have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes over the course of my life, want that money to help people with education, health care, food, shelter, etc.  Not bombs, war and destruction.  But a lot of people here feel the opposite.  And right now they pretty much run the government.</p>\n\n<p>2 - Once I heard R.

Capitalism is an example how a relative good system (\u201cthe best of the worse\u201d), can be misused due to the nature of mankind, greed in the example of capitalism. How can we close the gap between the ultimate rich and the ultimate poor in the world for instance, if greed keeps existing and the world doesn\u2019t wake up from its own nightmare?<br>Three weeks ago, I travelled through the US for my work. I was stunned by the homeless I saw, the people with three jobs, just to hold on to their houses. I got sick at the idea that people in that same country don\u2019t know what to do with their money and want to get rid of that one thing that would at least make an effort to bring healthcare to the ones that need it and cannot afford it\u2026and they call it a civilized country\u2026 You ask yourself the question on care: \u201c how can we provide care in the broadest sense when people drive cars into crowds\u201d? In my believe, you are part of the answer\u2026trying to figure out how to make a better world while still trying to pay of your study loans (opposed by you through capitalism), contributing to OpenCare project, figuring out how to reorganize care so it can affect more people, not only the rich. Change starts at the individual, individuals like you from where we hope it spreads like an oil spot at sea\u2026.I realize the irony in this phrase <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/blush.png?v=3" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:">\u2026</p>\n\n<p>People in general care first about themselves and their closed environments, hopefully to pay attention to the rest of the world afterwards in order to make things better for everyone. Take myself as an example\u2026.This is the first time you see me react to a post\u2026.this is because I am on vacation, having the time to read stuff that is on the internet from my network. I spend my days working for a big capitalist company, making a decent living. The industry I am working for makes an awful lot of money from a primary need, I know this and try to compensate through ScimPulse, but in essence I am just \u201c as bad\u201d as everybody else but with the effort of trying to mitigate. First me and my surroundings, then the rest of the world\u2026..it\u2019s a mentality<br>It is just this that is also drawing my attention from this post and you briefly touched it\u2026\u2026.we seem to care only for the \u201cWestern\u201d part of this world. We see I don\u2019t know how much footage about rampages in US and Europe\u2026even some on Mexico but not nearly as much as from the US or other rich Western countries\u2026..close to home..anyway in the same cluster of welfare. It is not a contest but the impact and casualties in other parts of the world, caused by same or different catastrophes are much, much worse. </p>\n\n<p>i.e. Bangladesh flooding\u2019s, earth slides in China, Inida, parts of south America\u2019s, starvation in Africa, mass killings in Africa and Eastern part of the world, political repression and imprisonment even in Turkey (where we don\u2019t have the guts to stand up due to political/economical interests), the remainders/consequences of Arabic spring (and I believe this is also part of what you try to point out Faruqh, when you argue oppose\u2026.will come back to this later\u200b<img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">). Like you mentioned, those which are impacted the most, are those from we western capitalist greedy society is taken the most advantage<br>With Open Care I believe we try to touch the lives of many by trying to organize care in such a way that more will benefit and it stays sustainable towards the future\u2026\u2026We try to make better and preserve what we have\u2026.what about the people deprived of care? I hope we also can have the discussion on how we can get care to those which are deprived of what we have\u2026we seem to care first of our own ecosystem\u2026\u2026it\u2019s a mentality<br>Perhaps our first point of attention should be to mitigate the differences in the world instead of making better what we have\u2026..? I know, this is a very blunt statement, but consider, for a large part we harvest the consequences of \u201cus\u201d exploiting those countries which suffer the most now\u2026\u2026<br>Perhaps what we learn in this project could also be of benefit when we try to solve these kind of utterly questions\u2026\u2026.There must be a correlation between prosperity and individualism (read, not having community care)\u2026Take Europe for example, starting at the South of Europe, where there is a lot more of community care, traveling to the North and take for instance The Netherlands, my home country. No way, I am going to take care of my parents in my home. Not because I don\u2019t love them\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026..I am too busy to take care of my own closed environment first (my household), no room for my parents (or any other family members).

We are all doing it, we are all living in this society that \u201c forces\u201d  us into a materialistic approach towards life\u2026\u2026wanting more and more and abusing capitalism\u2026.it\u2019s a mentality<br>\u201c How can we provide care in the broadest sense, if we are not willing to stribe towards equality\u201d? \u201cHow can we provide care in the broadest sense, when we are not able to change the individualist mentality we have in a large part of the western world\u201d? I mean, US is often seen as \u201c the leader of the free world\u201d , home of the brave, land of opportunities\u2026..yes, if you are born in the right circumstances (color, social class)\u2026.and it is this country that is trying it utmost to deprive the needed of care..<br>The challenges we face in care are utterly complex and not to be captured/solved in a project. They vary from indifference to ignorance\u2026\u2026from protectionism to fear. How do we change mentality in this world so we will not only improve the care system we have, but utterly we can have the entire world have a care system as good as ours\u2026and at the same time keep it affordable through a different way of caring?<br>First thing we should do is not neglecting other parts of the world where people suffer from the same disasters the western world is facing, but only the essential impact to lives is exponentially bigger. Second thing we should do is asking ourselves how we can change individualistic mindsets and disconnect it of prosperity and wealth. \u201cWellbeing\u201d , not \u201cwealth\u201d should be the way that we should look at life\u2026easier said than done hey\u2026<img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/blush.png?v=3" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"> I just claimed I will never take my parents into my home, because it doesn\u2019t fit my dynamic life that brings me my wealth\u2026I am doing the same, how can I make a difference in changing this mentality then?

But, in general, it seems to me that there is no one-to-one correspondence between a space and a way of life. I live in Brussels, where you have about one third Belgians, one third European migrants, such as myself, and one-third non-European migrants, mostly from Morocco, Turkey and Congo (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels#Nationalities">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels#Nationalities</a>). If any one group pushes too hard to enforce its way of life, the city will become unlivable. And then, it\'s not like there is one way of life, even within the same group. Italians and Danes are both Europeans, but they do not necessarily live in the same way. Belgians are themselves split across the Wallonian/Flemish linguistic and cultural line. And Moroccans and Congolese... you get the idea.</p>\n\n<p>Low-diversity neighborhoods such as Molenbeek (where it can happen to a random woman to be scolded because no hijab) are seen as brewing trouble. I do not know enough to take a position myself, but <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/molenbeek-broke-my-heart-radicalization-suburb-brussels-gentrification/">this post</a> made the rounds in late 2015. It made me think a lot. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, low local diversity does not mean lack of oppression. In Tunisia after the revolution, for example, there was a big political fight on the political rights of women. Both the progressive and the conservative religious side of the argument claimed to speak in the name of the same Arab and Muslim tradition. The culture was homogenous, but at least some people did not feel they were getting a completely fair deal <em>from the people sharing their same culture</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The usual way to get out of this complexity is, in the West, human rights. This is a legal culture that says: the rights of individuals supersede the rights of groups. It\'s historically kind of new \u2013 individuals have been seen as expendable for most of human history \u2013 and not everybody buys into it, not even in Europe (its birthplace). </p>\n\n<p>If I am completely off the mark, just ignore me <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 35807, u'date': u'2017-09-18 17:09:50'}, {u'user_id': 249, u'title': u'The middle ground is mutual respect. It is ', u'comment_id': 36543, u'content': u"<p>The middle ground is mutual respect. It is like a line in the sand. To cross on either side is to jeopardize the stability of that group. Robert Frost illustrated this concept in the Mending Wall. \u2018Good fences make good neighbors.' </p>\n\n<p>In our efforts to embrace diversification we have not paid proper heed to those who would like to embrace their individuality. integration and diversity are great, but as a construct, they should not be used to reduce the individuality of any group. If a group chooses to insulate themselves from diversity then it should be their choice. It should also be respected by others without considering the individuals to be racists. Diverse lifestyles should be respected on par with segregated lifestyles by honoring the choices of the people who live those lives. In the end everyone wants what they feel deep in their hearts is best for them and their families.</p>\n\n<p>The problem comes with oppression. When any group of people try to force their ideals on another person and desecrate their life choices. Whether it be a feminist trying to destroy the hijab, a white supremacist trying to impose a false superiority on other races, or a liberal and diverse group trying to take over a town founded and cultivated by white separatists, it is all wrong. And when someone tries to destroy your way of life, directly tries to destroy it, then you should fight back. By any means necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Where this line gets gray is when one community has profound dependencies on another. Example, when an insulated white group has benefited from excessive amounts of diverse labor to build their ideal community. Well, there is a price to be paid beyond simple salary. Now there is a since of entitlement that mus be compensated. If it is ignored then it will lead to revolt. </p>\n\n<p>Every people should be deeply involved in the process of securing a successful future for their people.  But, when another set of people use the entirety of your resources in order to propagate the future of their people, there becomes a feeling that the indentured party should have proper access to what they built. Whereas those who it was built for claim exclusive ownership. This is the case in many urban US cities. This is a platform for conflict.</p>\n\n<p>In the end the problem only exist in shared spaces. Typically urban, these spaces will always be habitats of co-existence and should be left to those with that desire. For those who seek separation in an urban space then the law should restrict their engagements in order to reduce the possibility of violent action. When the law fails to do so then the attacked reserves the right to stop the aggressor by any means necessary.</p>", u'post_id': 35807, u'date': u'2017-09-18 13:44:03'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'Thanks for this Frank @woodbinehealth , it so ', u'comment_id': 36528, u'content': u'<p>Thanks for this Frank <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/woodbinehealth">@woodbinehealth</a> , it so clearly resonates.

The only people I\'m seeing that can do this (kind of) are a selected few science fiction writers: Cory Doctorow, Bruce Sterling, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Peter Watts. Of these, Doctorow is the one who most explicitly engages with economic theory. Some years ago I wrote <a href="http://www.cottica.net/2010/08/30/leconomia-di-makers-di-cory-doctorowthe-economics-of-cory-doctorows-makers/">an economist\'s take on his novel "Makers"</a>, and I am now under the influence of his recent "[Walkaway]"(<a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2017/05/10/coases-spectre/">http://crookedtimber.org/2017/05/10/coases-spectre/</a>).

Please let me know, how to further proceed from here.</p>\n\n<p>I would prepare something about the nexus between peace studies and health studies. One of the fathers of Peacebuilding, Johan Galtung, argues that the triangle diagnosis-prognosis-therapy can be applied. "There is the common idea of a system (of actors, of cells), of well-states and ill-states. The word pairs \u201chealth-disease\u201d from health studies and \u201cpeace-violence\u201d from peace studies can be seen as specifications of these very general labels."</p>\n\n<p>Both states of being actually need <strong>diagnosis</strong> (or analysis), not only violence and disease. Peace and health also have their conditions and their contexts. They may be different from the conditions for violence and disease, but could also be related to them. Galtung argues that a condition for peace could be an equitable relation, but we have to factor in the violence in a non-exploitative system, if something goes wrong within one single actor. Thus, a condition for health is a stable equilibrium of key parameters of the human body, and yet one cell or a colony of cells may go wrong, starting growing out of all proportions for instance.</p>\n\n<p>If the system falls out of its \u201cwell-state\u201d and shows symptoms of ill-states coming up, or they are already there, the question to be answered in a <strong>prognosis</strong> is whether the system is capable of self-restoration back to its well-state, or whether some other type of intervention is needed.           Galtung warns that and intervention from the outside should not be identified with therapy. First, it may on the balance make the system worse (Do No Harm); Secondly, living beings may also be capable of providing self-therapy.  Thirdly, self-restoration does not necessarily mean conscious, deliberate intervention. The system may \u201ctake care of itself\u201d. Our bodies have that amazing <br>capacity to restore equilibrium through incredibly complex mechanisms that we have hardly even started to understand, leave alone are capable of influencing. The interesting question to ask is how to provide positive conditions for those restorative functions.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, when it comes to <strong>therapy</strong>, meaning by that "deliberate efforts by Self or Other to move the system back again to some well-state, or at least in that general direction". When we talk about the distinction between negative and positive peace, we should also keep in mind the difference between curative and preventive therapy. All four of them stand for well-states. There is no (or very little) disease or violence around. The systems are (almost) symptom-free, but in the negative case that is about all that can be said about them. The equilibrium is so unstable that a (minor) incident of hate speech can bring the system into an ill-state. In the negative case the equilibrium is more stable, meaning there is more capacity of self-restoration, even if the system may not be entirely symptom-free. Curative therapy aims at the former, preventive therapy at the latter.

I enjoyed reading them from the first until the last word and felt very touched as they brought up images of informal camps in Greece (e.g. Idomeni in the north borders, the islands and other places) where similar situations and an amazing solidarity movement arose to provide care for the people there.</p>\n\n<p>In all these places, it was very encouraging to see what can be achieved when determination of refugees and solidarity from activists/volunteers is combined in a self-organised and impulsive way. In the informal PIKPA camp in Lesvos for example, refugees create beautiful, colourful bags from discarded, life-jacket materials and are also planning to distribute them abroad.</p>\n\n<p>There is many hopeful examples of such great initiatives in Greece and other countries and I am sure they will multiply as refugees are settling for a longer-time period in their new living places.</p>\n\n<p>What seems to be important right now, in order to make all this effort more meaningful and useful, is to move further from just providing for the basic needs to create structures of solidarity and cooperation that can provide more sustainable solutions and allow people to take care of themselves and feel empowered.

So, refugees are more free to cooperate, R2R, then they would be in an official camp.

I think it could be important. Normal policy is that\xa0fast, messy, large scale response <em>has to be stopped</em>. Citizens are told to stay home, stay out of the way as the professionals dust off their contingency plans. If we can make a case for this to be the wrong thing to do in some case, it is goping to be an important policy contribution.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 737, u'date': u'2016-09-17 09:49:38'}, {u'user_id': 2569, u'title': u'Will think and post here', u'comment_id': 19222, u'content': u"<p>I think there's a lot to be said about suboptimality when it come to care and response.

Citizens are told to stay home, stay out of the way as the professionals dust off their contingency plans"</p>\n\n<p>It seems that this is true in\xa0cases where: a) a contingency plan already exists (e.g. Earthquake in Nepal, Disaster Relief in Sub-Saharan Africa) The above examples are plans for\xa0disasters that occur frequently and regularly in places that share a geographic similarity or border.\xa0It would seem logical to expect that, for example, a disaster relief plan for helping people in Nepal would also be of use if a similar problem occurred in Kashmir, or Bhutan. Since similar types of disaster are likely to occur in those place it makes sense to defer to NGOs on the ground in those areas.</p>\n\n<p>But,\xa0in order for us to \'leave it to the professional\' there have to be NGO\'s willing, and able to step into that role in the space.</p>\n\n<p>What has happened in\xa0Greece and Calais is\xa0we have seen NGOs step up initially, but then step back from the problem.\xa0Often because they cannot work with the changing political situation. I am thinking here of\xa0MSF pulling out of\xa0Lesvos after\xa0the EU-Turkey repatriation deal occurred. (<a href="http://www.msf.org.uk/article/why-is-msf-closing-its-moria-project-on-lesvos" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.msf.org.uk/article/why-is-msf-closing-its-moria-project-on-lesvos</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The French government\'s\xa0reluctance to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Calais camp\xa0has created\xa0a\xa0vacuum.\xa0So,\xa0NGOs have struggled to work in that area. Because they cannot work\xa0under license, they cannot reduce\xa0the suffering there, except on a micro\xa0scale.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the idea of sub-optimality in the system comes back to a\xa0wider\xa0idea. One that is floating around in other areas of the site, that of \'unlicensed behavior\'. Once\xa0an organisation or NGO becomes \'legitimate\',\xa0it tends to deal\xa0with Governments. It starts to operate at a higher level politically. This brings with it more constraints on the way it can act (at least overtly).\xa0It becomes more constrained to\xa0do\xa0things \'the correct\xa0way\' and less able to focus\xa0on doing what is required.</p>\n\n<p>When there isn\'t a precident\xa0for dealing with a disaster on the scale or in that location two options remain. Either improvise or adapt. Both options work with sub-optimality from different directions.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The NGO is most likely to adapt. They will find solutions used in other areas, or to address different problems, and adapt them to the new situation. These solutions are \'tried and tested\' and so they can point to evidence that shows where they have worked in the past. The NGO avoids looking bad\xa0if this approach fails, because they can show ways it has worked before. Their cultural and political capital stays strong and they can work on a new response in the long term. I expect that the lessons learned by MSF et al during this decade\'s\xa0refugee crisis in Europe will lead to contingency plans that will be used around the globe in the future. They struggle to deal with the problem in real time though.</p>\n\n<p>At the other end the improviser continually adapts what they are doing to try new solutions. They are willing to try anything. They are willing to\xa0fail\xa0because they have no social or political capital to diminish, except with the people they work with directly.\xa0This means they do not provide a consistent service, but they can evolve new solutions quickly through ongoing prototypes. They risk creating failures, but know that they will move on to another possibility the next day. This behaviour can be seen in the citizen organised projects in Calais and Greece.</p>\n\n<p>What is required is a way of feeding the experiences and innovation prototyped by the improvised,\xa0citizen-led organisation\xa0into the institutional learning of\xa0NGOs</p>', u'post_id': 737, u'date': u'2016-09-27 15:39:14'}, {u'user_id': 2551, u'title': u'Nepal ought to be a good case', u'comment_id': 19228, u'content': u'<p>They ran the SOPs (but did not factor in that Nepal is hard to get to/around in) so a lot of dogs were flown in to look for people under the rubble who had mostly perished by the time the dogs came.

We talked about this topic in the <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/fellowship-post-reflections-and-wayward-thoughts/6659">reflections</a> post we just published.  Overall, I think we should aim to be clear with the language we choose, but also recognize that our words will always be co-opted by the right/neo-liberal agenda.  In addition, they are inherently loaded words, we are in fact talking about changing the world, and not everyone will be into that.  But also recognizing that certain words have become trigger words not because of what they mean, but the meaning that capitalism/nation states/ governments have put into them.  Communism being case in point.  When most people think about communism, they think Stalinist USSR or other state controlled system.  We harken back to the original meaning of the word, most used in examples like early Marx theory, the French Commune, or the communism of the Spanish Civil War.  Even now, words like "autonomy", "mindfulness", "wellness" have all been co-opted and likely in the future will be unusable.  What I think our mission is is to be explicitly clear about the meaning of words and refuse to let the powers that be taint that meaning.

Perhaps when I see you in person we can do a discuss more. </p>\n\n<p>On here, I would suggest that through certain lenses, the best slash and burners of all time is one way to frame it, but we conceptualize a "non-extractive" homo would take it too far. I would argue that our human social abilities enables us at a group level to shape this world dramatically, but always, ALWAYS, subject to the laws of physics. Slash and Burn was one such technique, and one a planet with less than a million humans, it\'s practice probably weren\'t dramatic because the biomass and ecosystems of Earth could accommodate and might even have anticipated, needed this human phenomenon to occur for other life to emerge. This is not some sort of veiled "destruction breeds creation" American Neo-Conservative agenda, though I can see the overlap, this is one part of a larger history that has been for the most part erased from our collective consciousness. What I would call standard narrative. Slash and burning at different scales/different times produce different results, and it was one of many techniques used. We are also the best reforestors, animal migration pattern enforcers, hunters, seed spreaders, etc etc. America is a place where the story of human\'s actively managing and ensuring huge biodiversity and thriving has been suppressed, this is the story of the Indigenous people\'s who were largely decimated by the arrival of small pox. With the second wave of European immigration occured, they happened upon the most lush forests and largest Bison herds (due to decades of no culling) that this concept of "Pristine Nature" emerged, an environment free of humans (which it never was) that, I would argue very strongly, is retroactively framed by our dominant industrial complexed history to confirm the myth that makes what we do possible: Humans are inherently opposed to the ecosystems that sustain us. </p>\n\n<p>Nothing could be farther from the "truth", and we will definitely get into this, I\'m pretty "Post-Truth" at this point, we choose the narratives we represent, But one major vein of our work here at Biosphere(x) is to recover fragments of these forgotten narratives to counter the notion that "where humans go, megafauna disappear." Causation, Correlation depend the frameworks that inhabit us when we are exposed to this phrase. I would argue that megafauna are still around, though I would love to have seen Giant Sloths and Giraffes outside of central and southern Africa roaming, it is systems, not humans, which has led to the unprecedented extinction events, as well as collapse of microfauna habitats around the planet. Humans are vessels, what organisms inhabit them? Besides the billions of gut bacteria along for the ride <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/eimhin">@eimhin</a>,  I can see certain ideas coordinating millions for certain end goals. It\'s these ideas, which has scaled beyond anything before, which presents to challenges for us. Human Nature is not as malevolent or anti-nature as we see on movie screens or read about in standard narrative fiction/non-fiction/journalism (My opinion is that there is far too few attacks on the systems that drive us to short sighted progressions, we have names for them such as capitalism, patriarchy, totalitarian agriculture etc etc, but these suggest a compartmentalization of the issues, where as the memetic organisms are as multidimensional as you or me, and the problem is they are invisible to our eyes for the most part) Our will to survive and reproduce is not a sin nor commendable, but it\'s universal intra and extra-species. The fact that humans within our culture of industrial complexes has been able to replace like 80-90% of the biomass on the Earth\'s Surface with ones of our choosing is Disturbing to no end~ but the feed back loop that causes this isn\'t inherently part of our nature. If you need examples of human beings who don\'t live in the shadow of our culture and practice ways of life completely integral to their environments, I would consult with anthropologists, since I\'m not one. </p>\n\n<p>This is not a call towards "primitivism". There are very real reasons why the stories of humans living as one with nature aren\'t common. They don\'t scale well in the face of disease and military/economic pressures our culture has more than enough of. I would say that\'s the challenge, how to navigate and repurpose suppressed and non-scalable views for the future which really really needs them.</p>', u'post_id': 35053, u'date': u'2017-09-15 13:59:14'}, {u'user_id': 3804, u'title': u'\n\neimhin:\nThese are centralist, they deny the value of ', u'comment_id': 36342, u'content': u'<aside class="quote" data-post="1" data-topic="6855"><div class="title">\n<div class="quote-controls"></div>\n<img alt="" width="20" height="20" src="https://edgeryders.eu/user_avatar/edgeryders.eu/eimhin/40/80_1.png" class="avatar">eimhin:</div>\n<blockquote><p>These are centralist, they deny the value of untramelled nature and simple work, they demand privilege and power over submission to the greater order of this earth, and they will get us all in big trouble in the very short term.</p></blockquote></aside>\n\n<p>Hey <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/eimhin">@eimhin</a>, have you read the book Ishmael by Daniel Quinn? </p>\n\n<p>Your post deeply resonates with me.

The week before at Cloughjordan Ecovillage I met Albert Bates, author of The Biochar Solution, (<a href="https://www.newsociety.com/Books/B/The-Biochar-Solution" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newsociety.com/Books/B/The-Biochar-Solution</a>)which lists the products, science, and strategies regarding the use of biochar to return us to the known normal levels of atmospheric carbon by the charring of wood, turning the carbon to its recalcitrant form, and thus taking it out of the \'labile\' cycle whereby organic matter rots, releasing it\'s carbon as atmospheric carbon which returns to the earth with rains recompiling organic matter in 12 to 15 year cycles. Biochar stays in the soil as structure, and as Willem Reich points out in the Bion Experiments, when you add potassium to char, with bacteria, you get the breakdown of said char into vesicular structures which form the basic food stuff for bacteria and microorganisms, hence biochar is both a form of capturing carbon, and a super food for soil biology. </p>\n\n<p>So yes, I agree, regenerative approaches are there in evidence, and can be developed. Biochar also can serve as a sand substitute in concrete and has a number of superior properties, including that it floats, for example.  It can be used in paint, when mixed at 1% to 99% silage it reduces methane output in cattle by 35%, and improves digestion and immunity, reducing need for antibiotics,  used as bedding it suppresses ammonia formation so no ammonia smell, it can be used with plastic in recycling composites, and as a paint, among other things. Fascinating stuff. </p>\n\n<p>I find that inoculation,  or as Albert calls it, \'microbialisation\' of the char, works well with digestate from our biodigestor. All that surface area means lots of oxygen and so the anaerobic bacteria die off leaving a foodstuff for the bacteria in the compost heap where we keep the char for a couple of weeks before putting out on the soil. We hope to go no-dig next season, with the six inch cover layer in biochar altogether. </p>\n\n<p>Partners to the project include DTC , the development technologies in the community research group, based in ireland at DIT, as one node of a global network.

So while humans destroy parts of the earth beyond recognition, other humans may find ways to create ecological diversity in other parts <em>beyond</em> what nature could do if left alone.

It is also a recognition that the separatist extractive and self interested ego, in the pursuit of one or another form of power, is a prevailing feature of the detriment.</p>\n\n<p>Only a fool denies that he needs to eat, and that the food must come of the land, and that the quality of each are important to one\'s well being and survival. That said, the world has ample evidence these days of such foolishness.</p>\n\n<p>In the Daoist tradition the sage immortal is often found riding backwards on a donkey through the mountain villages. The children laugh and ask, \'why are you travelling, facing backward on the donkey?\' - "It is not me", replies the sage, "but rather that the donkey does not know where it is<br>going".</p>\n\n<p>To know where one is is the key to taking appropriate next step. To know where one is, one must know how things have come to create the conditions of the present. Things ever come into being by the same process and as such cycles can be observed in the evolution of things. And so, as such, it is wisdom to look backward, as one moves forward, the ego is a donkey, it does not know where it is going.</p>\n\n<p>Care beyond the self beyond the family or  band is hardly a modern invention, though I appreciate where you are coming from. The Avalokitsevara details the 37 principles of the bodhisattva, an ancient acknowledgement of the spectrum on which all things find themselves. To one side pure nefarious self interest, to the far extreme on the other of bodhisattvic altruism. The distinction is one of practice, by which one comes to disidentify with personal as self, and take responsibility for all<br>of creation, through the lived medium of self; that is, for practitioners. For the unpracticed life there is apparent separation in what is inherently unified, and an evolution from there of Lila, the will to live play breath bleed and die unto new life.</p>\n\n<p>Either way for us we want to live, with some degree of wellbeing, and this requires basic sustenance. You have posed a fatal argument,  basically that our nature is unchangeable and that we are fucked in the greater scheme of things, and while I agree to some extent, I can choose how I live. It is not by personal choice that I experience the breaking of the normal bodily function, near death, healing, and the change that that requires. I wish for others that they see the problem now as it is, and choose to heal, without the global  invention of dire necessity. In the meantime, conscious of the prevailing stupidity, it is wisdom to be prepared, and practiced in resilience on behalf of those short of insight.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck to us all.</p>', u'post_id': 35053, u'date': u'2017-08-31 10:48:11'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'You seem to be doing good work, @eimhin, ', u'comment_id': 35118, u'content': u'<p>You seem to be doing good work, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/eimhin">@eimhin</a>, and it\'s great news that your health has improved so much.

But I find it hard to believe that any human cultural tradition can lead to living in harmony with nature. We belong to a species that has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind">driven the megafauna to extinction wherever it touched land</a> \u2013 and we are not speaking of modern adventurers with guns, but of hunters-gatherers with spears. That, according to the latest interpretations of archaeological evidence, existed in an almost constant state of warfare to keep density below one person per square mile (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=y_XD7KHgGWkC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=leblanc+%E2%80%9Cas+the+city+folk%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ntUHi8ntQu&amp;sig=axP0-BKlJeIeza0WCC4f-U83mmk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xvA6Su3LGIfGMpSevagO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1">reference one</a>, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/10278703">reference two</a>). That has an <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10543.html">innate preference for in-group individuals</a> ("those like us, not those others"), demonstrated by research on children as young as six months (this is the biological kernel of racism and discrimination \u2013 and we all have it). This is rape, not harmony. Extraction, it seems, is at the very core of our species\'s success. Non-extractive <em>homo</em> have gone extinct. We are the descendants of the best slash-and-burners.</p>\n\n<p>As for ecology, nature thrives wherever man leaves it alone. The Chernobyl radioactive disaster area, just about human technological folly at its worst, has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_the_Chernobyl_disaster#Studies_on_wildlife_in_the_Exclusion_Zone">thriving wildlife</a>, with lynx and bears and bisons and wild horses (wild horses! In Europe!). This has led elder ecologist Stewart Brand to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Discipline">suggest</a> that mega-cities are the greenest solution for hosting homo sapiens. If you love nature, he says, set her free... of your presence. </p>\n\n<p>This in no way diminishes the usefulness of what you are doing. Of course there is much practical knowledge to be gathered from living from the land. But it seems more likely that care beyond the family and the band is a modern invention. I will look for it in the future, not in the past.

I\'m based in NYC, and one of my main organizing activities here is with a local Cop Watch team. The movement has been getting a bit more press for the past handful years due to sensationalist news cycles and I genuine growth of grassroots teams popping up around the country. </p>\n\n<p>My team is around 6 years old, and our main activities are consistent "patrols" in which we film all police encounters with the public if we happen upon them, and the vast majority is handing out "Know Your Rights" fliers in a couple different languages depending on the neighbor make we are in that night. </p>\n\n<p>Cop Watch is a form of community self defense, in which one goal is to raise the level of awareness in the community about their rights and options which encountering the police, and leveraging the ubiquity of digital cameras so that people everywhere can record police, not just to catch misconduct or brutality, but because it\'s perfectly legal to film. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, with the past 3 years, we have been hitting a wall in terms of the limits of our efficacy, because in our consistent patrolling, we often come across instances in the community that don\'t involve police but require some sort of intervention, whether it means homelessness, interpersonal or mass violence, injury, public intoxication etc etc. I guess we are coming post-"Who Watches the Watchmen" phase, where we are asking ourselves, what is our role? Is it just to enable people to operate within legal frameworks? or should the hours and energy we expend week after week be do towards visions of a world where legal frameworks are obsolete? (very lofty) What are the practical steps before then. </p>\n\n<p>One of the first programs we are implementing is a rapid response network, right now it\'s just through a big texting group of people who have opted in, which in itself presents severe scaling issues, which in turn, limits it\'s usefulness. We don\'t really have the expertise to design an app since most of our team aren\'t programmers. Our hope with this was to intervene before the state got involved in community affairs.

Evolution might have come up with self-awareness as device to increase fitness along the way. </p>\n\n<p>However, a biologist-cum-science fiction writer called Peter Watts has been popularising very interesting, fringe theoretical biology papers that posit that: (a) you can imagine intelligence without self-awareness (in fact we are even building it, in the form of AI); (b) self-awareness is costly to mantain (cortex and neocortex tissue sucking up glucose to maintain continuity of the homunculus behind our eyes); (c) because of (b), an intelligent but not self-aware lifeform, if it were to emerge, would eventually outcompete self-aware ones.

He carried a large camping stove, a large tank of water, a large bag of coffee and five or six coffee machines. He started offering hot coffee to people digging in the rubble.</p>\n\n<p>Over the following two days, "Quake Caf\xe9" became a meeting point for people to get organised, plan their effort for the day, hustle for wanted materials, offer help, exchange information (this is 1980, no Twitter). By offering a natural "hub", Quake Caf\xe9 had enabled a myriad small initiative to happen faster and more efficiently, with a minimal effort. Positive feedback kicked in: the barista himself got more organised, he now had small snacks and a helper. All the while, the state was struggling to get together a response. On the third day, the army moved in, but they had more guns than shovels. They could not much to help, at least initially, but they did order the barista to pack up and go home. </p>\n\n<p>Lanzara was stunned. How was it that local people could stitch together the embryo of a system in a few hours, with no resources, no command power and no coordination tools? And how was it that the mighty machine of the state, who did have resources, command power and organisation, sputtered first and then actually did damage, preventing what was working from continuing operations? </p>\n\n<p>This small episode, and a few others in the same earthquake, spurred a wave of sociological literature that continues to this day. I have only read Lanzara\'s 1993 <a href="http://www.lafeltrinelli.it/libri/lanzara-giovan-francesco/capacita-negativa/9788815040862">book</a> (in Italian), but not his earlier article in English on the <em>Journal of Management Studies</em>, and not the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradise-Built-Hell-Extraordinary-Communities/dp/0143118072">book by Rebecca Solnit</a> which probably you, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/michael_dunn">@michael_dunn</a>, have in mind.  </p>\n\n<p>I am not too optimistic about the possibility to do policy based on these intuition.

What came out was the question of whether teaching prevention, taking on a single point of system failure could be lower hanging fruit for groups like yours who make a real contribution but also risk overburdening or taking on too big a task. Meeting basic survival needs like housing or food, which are traditionally system tasks is more difficult and involve a certain work\xa0with the system in order to build that\xa0major capacity - i.e. charities or grant funded organisations.\xa0 <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/maymay">@maymay</a> can confirm if this is a good summary.</p>\n\n<p>Over these 20 years GalGael is surely becoming a repository\xa0of learnings and things which work, or dont.

It all goes back to\xa0how we build the infrastructure needed, a point nicely made by <span class="mention">@Woodbine</span> .</p>', u'post_id': 6376, u'date': u'2017-06-05 20:44:08'}, {u'user_id': 3613, u'title': u'Urgency and Agency', u'comment_id': 13972, u'content': u'<p>Hello all <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/woodbinehealth">@Woodbinehealth</a>,\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I really connect with all you\'ve said here and in particular you\'re sense of urgency and the imperative of radically different approaches to health and its broader determinants. I have often found myself at well intentioned workshops with rooms full of professionals working hard at designing perfect interventions that will deliver the miraculous \u2018product\' of health to our communities. I\u2019m intensely frustrated by the waste of human resources and energy when surely it must be obvious that health is not simply the output of professional \u2018interventions\u2019 (even the clinical language makes me recoil). Surely it\u2019s obvious that health is also fundamentally the natural outcome of healthy communities, relationships and systems - including our political and economic systems.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The work I\'m involved in\xa0at GalGael came out of fires protesting motorways bringing asthma and nature deprivation to communities in Glasgow already hard pressed. We created relative safety admist a housing scheme where there was little.\xa0We learnt along the way - by accident - the sense of agency that comes from \u2018the act of sharing responsibilities\u2019 within the context of the encampment. We chose to continue to work with that sense of agency and still do so 20 years after the motorway was built. We\u2019ve continued learning and particularly the extent to which that sense of agency is profoundly connected to our health. We\u2019re lucky in Scotland to have had a recent Government Chief Medical Officer who underlined the importance of work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salutogenesis">salutogenesis</a> - the importance of studying what makes us healthy rather than disease itself - and the role that our sense of control over our own lives plays in our health; both physical and mental. (Harry Burns - I believe he is regularly in NY)</p>\n\n<p>For a while we were disheartened to see people we\u2019d worked with on issues of addiction appear back at our doors. What were we doing wrong? We were adamant that we did not want to be another revolving door for people stuck in the cogs of a poverty industry or disease factory. Slowly we realised - by classical \'analysing our own reality\' - that the systems and relationships beyond our doors and beyond our direct influence were considerably more effective at creating disease and dysfunction than we could ever be at resolving it - especially on grant funded (frequently cut) project work, creating environments where people could find greater health and humanity. And now we know the imperative of both - to be there when people need us on the renewed understanding that many diseases and social ills are adaptations to the dysfunction in our wider systems. On its own, this would amount to little more than sticking a finger in a crack in the harbour wall in the face of a tsunami. So now we understand that working to influence system change is also essential to not only the health in individuals but increasingly the survival of our communities. I find what Deborah Frieze refers to as\xa0\'<a href="https://vimeo.com/17907928">hospicing the\xa0dying</a>\' in relation to systems\xa0helpful - an important aspect of care work in our times. What is called for as old systems collapse? How do we work to illuminate and support the emergence of the new?\xa0</p>\n\n<p>These thoughts\xa0led to me proposing a track for the Open Village - <a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/theme-session-proposal-architectures-of-love-policy-vs-culture-in-creating-the-conditions-for-opencare/6271">see more here</a>.

Most recently they\'ve been managing a lot of funding that has come in for the <a href="https://envirodatagov.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Environmental Data Governance Initiative (EDGI)</a>. It\'s a little different, but the same trust issues apply. I think they would also be happy to share the details of their practices.</p>\n\n<p>In Germany, Open Knowledge Foundation fairly recently launched their <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/" rel="nofollow noopener">Prototype Fund</a>, which distributes funding from the German Education and Research ministry to smaller civic tech projects. Again, similar but different. I could see what I can find out about that as well.</p>\n\n<p>Neither of those are so clearly about ecosystems or focussed collective action between smaller initiatives, as edgeryders is. But interesting nonetheless. I think this could be a really interesting and practical discussion.</p>', u'post_id': 6427, u'date': u'2017-06-20 22:17:45'}, {u'user_id': 8, u'title': u'Ecosystems vs. individual projects.', u'comment_id': 7509, u'content': u"<p>Hi Lucy,</p>\n\n<p>A little context: Last year we ran a small experiment to build a collective bid for the MacArthur Foundation's 100 Million USD grant. Edgeryders wrote the meta application, and then set up a simple process through which projects could attach themselves to the bid (approx requirement of work for each participating project=\xa02.5hr). The Edgeryders organisation was the organisation which would then take responsibility for managing the funds.\xa0We did manage to get past the first round (administrative due diligence). It was a good way to go about it in that it also helped us better understand what people in the OpenCare/broader Edgeryders community need. The design of the OpenVillage festival is based on what we learned.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if you saw that we just won a World Bank bid. The work we will be doing will build on this idea of nurturing initiatives as part of a collective effort towards something. We're still learning how to do this, but the results so far are promising. So maybe it could make sense to dedicate a session to sharing strategies, even past funding applications that worked for remixing etc...</p>", u'post_id': 6427, u'date': u'2017-06-20 10:35:03'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u"Hi @GiladGome, I'm Noemi and contributing to good ", u'comment_id': 34923, u'content': u'<p>Hi <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/giladgome">@GiladGome</a>, I\'m Noemi and contributing to good information flows around here <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Community manager since six years now.

The whole idea of OSM (or Google Maps), as far as I understand it, is that it provides the data for <em>other people</em> to build applications on top of. The OSM wiki has several routing examples optimised by different needs (for example <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Routing#Bicycle">this one</a> for cyclists).</li>\n<li>Any data you collect that do not meet the OSM stringent requirements, like the 10 simple questions, can be stored on your own server and "mixed" with map data on the fly via API calls. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, it seems that (in theory) you could build an added value application on top of OSM as of Google. The difference is that Google data are not plastic the way OSM data are: any edit to the Google database you have to ask for, then wait and hope, whereas in OSM you can just go ahead and make the edit yourself. This has big implications in terms of building community and awareness. For example, you can organise <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_parties">mapping parties</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Besides this technical issue, you might enjoy the work that the City of Milan is doing in a similar vein: trying to build cheap, simple solutions for shopkeepers to make their shops wheelchair accessible.

Couldn\'t leave without saying how much your stories moved me. Its so interesting to read about a corrupt and failing system. Im sorry to hear that your people, family and friends have to suffer through it and live with the ever lingering anxiety of how to provide healthcare for the elderly and ageing population. It\'s amazing to realise how different the structure is here in the UK where healthcare and social support is free for all. I have often been critical about the impact of free healthcare on the complacency of families to neglect and dismiss their elders to the care of the state, often with huge and high expectations of what the state can and should provide. I think it has contributed to a fractured family structure in society with sometimes little care and responsibility of families to look after their loved ones. There is an enormous financial burden that is placed on the NHS with the ageing population, to have them pick up the bill for every person in a care home is unsustainable and to some degree unfair on the system itself. </p>\n\n<p>Reading this however, I can appreciate a little more the enormous pressures that is put on family and friends when this support does not exist. It is inspiring to hear of people such as Vlad Voiculescu who come into support others in an otherwise neglected area. There is amazing potential for the redistribution of wealth (and wealth in health care provisions). The money is out there and the provisions most definitely are as well, they are just not spread evenly!! </p>\n\n<p>As always we may hope on a middle ground, with services available for the elderly, looking after their specific health care needs. But I would hope that family involvement would always be encouraged and part of a sustainable system. Even within a globalised world we still hope for community. <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 685, u'date': u'2017-08-09 19:59:19'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'Ok.. homework for me.', u'comment_id': 10998, u'content': u"<p>Thanks.\xa0It's not just you, I had read your Amish related post and at the time was just working on this one on my own.\xa0So clearly there is something there about tightly knit communities making decisions together and planning thoroughly their care system - investments and returns.</p>\n\n<p>As to the cytostatics, you're right - I will ask Vlad\xa0and common friends to make a connection and take it from there.

I've gone ", u'comment_id': 33584, u'content': u'<p>Hi <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/chrisjcook">@chrisjcook</a>, nice to read you. I\'ve gone through your posts and links and your reply to <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/markomanka">@markomanka</a> clears up some of the confusion he brought up. Yet I want to summarize to see if I understand correctly since I\'m no expert at all. It became a bit of a long post.</p>\n\n<p>I understand a business model as the mechanism by which someone generates value and is compensated when they exchange it with someone. In my mind there\'s several elements to this mechanism (tell me if it doesn\'t make sense):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>The value (food, education, housing, ...)</em></li>\n<li><em>The way of generating value (for the food example: allowing people to grow and pick their own vegetables, growing vegetables for people, ...)</em></li>\n<li><em>Who you are providing the value to (a company, a citizen, children, refugees, ...)</em></li>\n<li><strong>The compensation (money, in kind, credit, equity, intangible benefits such as more equality, ...)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The way of compensation (buying, pay-per-use, renting, STR, ...)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What I gather from what you wrote is are changes in the last two elements in bold, let\'s call them <strong>instruments and agreements</strong> (correct me if I\'m wrong). And that these would enable new ways of doing the elements in italic, let\'s call them the <em>value proposition</em> (according to <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/markomanka">@markomanka</a> , if I\'m correct in the use here). Like the example you gave of artists: they would be able to create cultural value (execute their value proposition), because they are individuals in a Guarantee Society (new agreement &amp; instrument). This enables either an established value proposition as a starting point, or would enable the artist to experiment with a new value proposition (with risk sharing through the default pool).<br><br><br>As somewhat of a pragmatist in trying to sustain a shared community space, I have to look from the side of new value propositions. Can we come up with new value, ways of generating value and find new target audiences? Within the standard instruments &amp; agreements: using money and selling or renting.</p>\n\n<p>Example: we develop and provide free education for underprivileged children through workshops (free). The educational content we developed is adapted to the formal education system through another series of workshops (material costs covered). Then we train teachers to use the material in the classroom (paid gig + profits to reinvest). Ultimately we sell our services as consultants and trainers in science communication (paid + profits to reinvest). We\'re aiming for a balance between all of them and are banking on the collective know how we build up.</p>\n\n<p>Figuring this out and implementing it is hard work: market research, mastering a skill and trade, finding partners, team collaboration, admin, ... And that for each of the steps described. Moreover, they have a clear time element: there is no shortcut for the learning curve of the people involved and there\'s simply only 24 hours in a day to do all the work.</p>\n\n<p>Although the implementation of new agreements and instruments is easier in a new project (no legacy of habits and outdated worldviews of key people), they usually don\'t have the time or resources to do that (let alone having enough time for their value proposition). And from experience, actions must have an advantage that increases chances of survival in the short term. The costs and risks are too high otherwise. You are often screwing yourself if you do not use the readily available agreements and instruments.</p>\n\n<p>Those who do have the means to try to implement new agreements and instruments, usually keep looking at the short term anyway, or they don\'t have it specifically on their mind, or it is a watered down version that comes back to short term benefits. Like big financial institutions trying to adopt blockchain these days.<br><br><br>Therefore I think focussing the business model narrative on agreements and instruments is not representative of reality. Value proposition plays a bigger role in my view. I\'m taking the perspective of a new or struggling project, as these are the majority of the projects I\'m in touch with. They are usually also those taking the longest shots at change.</p>\n\n<p>The cool thing about the design you describe is that a collective of established business/organisations/individuals would be able to carry the risks involved for new or struggling projects adopting new agreements and instruments. Moreover they have incentive to provide know how, network and help in implementing it. Benefits also go both ways, in terms of diversity and room for experimentation. </p>\n\n<p>The advantages are many. It\'s being attempted with various mechanisms and varying success, see eg. <a href="https://enspiral.com/">Enspiral</a> and <a href="https://www.transformabxl.be/">Transforma Bxl</a> or <a href="https://civicinnovation.network/site/">Civic Innovation Network</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Varying success, because it is not an easy thing to implement: bringing together parties, setting rules, navigating obstacles, ... It also has to come as an initiative of a party willing to invest time and resources for the unavoidable coordination costs, at a considerable risk of failure. Those who are aware, willing and capable are rare. Thus the fertile ground (or market opportunity) for third party services facilitating such a network, is not really there yet I think.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, I think there is an order to things. To me, it makes sense to start with the value proposition and then evolve towards adopting new agreements &amp; instruments when the capacity is there, after bridging a risky startup period.</p>\n\n<p>My two cents, as someone that has been involved in failed attempts at setting up such a network from the perspective of a new project.

Each party keeps his own records independently using debit and credit entries. However, double entry book-keeping records transactions which take place within a market paradigm of legal relationships (agreements - such as mortgages, limited liability corporations) and claims over value (instruments - such as equity ownership, debt and derivatives). This paradigm has evolved and become more and more sophisticated over time and has led to an unsustainable concentration of wealth.</p>\n\n<p> To use a sporting analogy, agreements are analogous to the rules of the game while instruments are analogous to the implements of a game such as bat and ball. </p>\n\n<p>The problem with double entry book-keeping is that its associated paradigm of absolute rights of ownership and use and \'for profit\' commodity transactions makes risk and production sharing difficult if not impossible. We hear a lot about the sharing economy, but simply put, shareholders (in a Joint Stock Company) are fundamentally incapable of sharing.</p>\n\n<p>The split tally stick provided a record not only of conventional debt instruments but also of the simplest instrument of them all, the credit instrument or promise.  This undated promise/credit instrument actually pre-dates all other instruments, and promises required a trust framework of implicit or explicit risk and production sharing agreements.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that through using the correct combination of credit instruments/promises and risk, revenue and production sharing agreements it is completely possible to create a new and resilient economy bottom up and moreover to do so without requiring any permission from any third party.</p>\n\n<p>For risk sharing I advocate a \'guarantee society\' agreement of which the best example is the Protection and Indemnity (P&amp;I) Club in the shipping industry. Here we have seen for 140 years ship owners clubbing together (and employing a manager) to mutually assure risks that Lloyds of London (\'for profit\' risk intermediaries) will not take.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.the3rdimagazine.co.uk/2013/04/the-community-is-the-currency/" rel="nofollow noopener">This article</a> illustrates how local credit risk might be assured using the same risk sharing approach.</p>\n\n<p>For production and revenue sharing we may use simple partnership agreements as referred to in my discussion with <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/gehan">@gehan</a>, and for long term funding of productive assets we may issue, and accept in exchange in payment for use, the credit instruments referred to.</p>\n\n<p>So in relation to Open Care I believe that it is possible to create new \'Care for Land Use\' swaps whereby in exchange for caring for People, Place or both, then carers may receive credits which are returnable in payment for residential or other use of land, or in payment for food production derived from land use. </p>\n\n<p>I envisage networks of carers - possibly using an 21st C quasi-guild approach - who share costs of a care platform (eg transport, scheduling, equipment, training and so on). In exchange for providing care, then carers may receive credits which they can use against essentials such as housing and energy use.</p>\n\n<p>If (as it appears) you are interested in the application of financial technology (Fintech) you might find my article on <a href="https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/fintech-2-0/2016/10/06" rel="nofollow noopener">Fintech 2.0</a> of interest</p>', u'post_id': 33485, u'date': u'2017-07-25 00:08:40'}, {u'user_id': 854, u'title': u'Thank you @gehan for sharing this...\n\nSInce, @chrisjcook, you ', u'comment_id': 33524, u'content': u'<p>Thank you <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/gehan">@gehan</a> for sharing this...</p>\n\n<p>SInce, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/chrisjcook">@chrisjcook</a>, you are online here (a pleasure to e-meet you), I would like to ask you to expand a bit about the example of the tally sticks. <br>Double entry book-keeping is a more formalized way of dealing with credit/debit, and the sticks do not allow anything, to my knowledge, that is impossible be the former...

It\'s clearly an interesting point in the trajectory of open source wetware. </p>\n\n<p>This decentralised stuff was never easy, for anyone. But biotech has an additional regulatory hurdle, which software hackers do not have. Hardware hackers do have it: Davide Gomba, an A-list Italian hardware hacker, once told me that regulation forbids people in the makerspace to touch the power tools, unless they are employees of the space itself! But you wetware guys are really in the regulator\'s crosshairs. </p>\n\n<p>Hopefully technologies like cell-free extracts will help with regulation, and microfluidics will help with cheap raw "experiment scalability". But in the end, I think Malcolm is really really right: at the end of the day, open source hackers need to bite the bullet and redo the work from scratch, but this time with the right license. Stallman and Torvalds and the others, they had to redo what other had already done. GNU/Linux was, at the beginning, a poor relative of Unix: but it was open, so it could be improved. </p>\n\n<p>And once that was done, you <em>still</em> had the problem of figuring what the hell was going on in the code that you were supposed to improve upon. Turns out hackers are better at getting code to run than at documenting it. Vast amounts of time are spent in trying to decipher code which is legally open, but hard to understand and therefore not really actionable. This is similar to your struggle with following up on the work already done in Oakland on insulin. Slowly, the toolkits emerged: in-code commenting practices, wikis, GitHub... there may be something to port to wet hacking there. </p>\n\n<p>Moved the topic to OpenCare, so <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/amelia">@amelia</a> does not miss it.

Pharmaceuticals were relatively easy to get out hands on, we relied heavily on donations of gloves, swabs, betadiene, tape, scissors, sterile fields and other small practical equipment from visiting healthcare providers from nearby Spain and Italy. They were sporadic, but on reflection it would have been very difficult without them or at the very least very expensive trying to source them over the counter. Unfortunately the whole area was destroyed and the migrants were gathered up and packed off to camps! <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning.png?v=3" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> the clinic was also bulldozed. It would be interesting to hear if any one had any bright idea about supply chains and resource/ equipment management in these "pop up" type clinics. I know <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/michael_dunn">@michael_dunn</a> is doing so work on emergency mutual aid of which supply chains may be a small but important feature.  </p>\n\n<p>I also really liked the Health Autonomy at the End of the World, written by <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/woodbinehealth">@woodbinehealth</a>. They paint a rather bleak picture of the breakdown and cut backs in healthcare structures within America.

Heinously documented, not put online &amp; though I remember saying the phrase "let\'s not bifurcate" a lot, ultimately the enthusiasm bifurcated...</p>\n\n<p>The bifurcation had a practical root - to do with resources, time, lack of funds to support it. Others wanted to steward the project but got distracted by their other work, families, health &amp; could not. I did not realise that my leadership and initiation of the group was a vital component of its existence &amp; my over emphasis on everyone\u2019s freedom was ultimately unhelpful to social organisation &amp; cohesion. I took on the workshops and AV and continued carrying the torch - but ran out of money to keep living in Brighton where I was, moved out to the countryside &amp; spectacularly ran out of energy at the CCC 2016. Still carrying this fire but agnostic about where I bring it. Now that I\'m in Petersfield UK - finding people who are working towards the area becoming a Transition Town, who are tending the river networks and are standing against the Oil drilling of the Weald. Every place has it\'s own needs.</p>\n\n<p>On the plus side of the cascade.network we didn\u2019t all destroy each other, or fall in love with each other and then destroy each other, which is a certain kind of success in group endeavours. The group experiment did not fall into wounds and trauma, sexual confusion, conflict and resentment. No one was nearly killed by the experience or driven half mad by it. We had a good knowledge exchange and the people it touched seemed opened, enlivened, emboldened. </p>\n\n<p>But\u2026 my focus is how to make the impulse &amp; the work stronger &amp; more effective because the intention is creative action &amp; we are living in the context of this crazy risky moment of transition where nothing but completely radical action will do.</p>\n\n<p>So how to give something of real value &amp; help shift a situation from not working or being actively toxic into health... I\'m thinking towards 2020 - that that year is a meaningful goal for clearly working together  <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/07/these-experts-say-we-have-three-years-to-save-the-planet-from-irreversible-destruction/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/07/these-experts-say-we-have-three-years-to-save-the-planet-from-irreversible-destruction/</a> </p>\n\n<p><em>Here\'s some useful stuff on ways of going about Creative Activism</em></p>\n\n<p>On the subject of planning bold meetings good stuff over at Centre for Artistic Activism</p>\n\n<p>What we have learnt from history - </p>\n\n<aside class="onebox whitelistedgeneric">\n  <header class="source">\n    <a href="https://artisticactivism.org/2016/11/c4aa-fundamentals-webinar-4-what-weve-learned-from-history/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">artisticactivism.org</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class="onebox-body">\n    <img src="https://artisticactivism.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/C4AA-Fundamentals-4.jpg" width="690" height="335" class="thumbnail">\n\n<h3><a href="https://artisticactivism.org/2016/11/c4aa-fundamentals-webinar-4-what-weve-learned-from-history/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">C4AA Fundamentals Webinar #4: What we\u2019ve learned from history</a></h3>\n\n<p>Stephen Duncombe and Steve Lambert dug back into social movements through the ages.

This training is on how to lead Action Planning Mee\u2026</p>\n\n  </article>\n  <div class="onebox-metadata">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n  <div style="clear: both"></div>\n</aside>\n\n\n<p>&amp; great resources here <a href="http://yeslab.org/kb" rel="nofollow noopener">http://yeslab.org/kb</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Nurture &amp; Patience</em></p>\n\n<p>You are very right about the challenge of nurture and getting a group to nurture itself without needing constant encouragement by particular people. That kind of resilient self organised network comes through time, hard knocks &amp; a shared understanding that if something is not working, that it\'s up to the person who is noticing to fix it, rather than complain/bitch/judge. The problem is that everyone is hardwired from how they\'ve worked in more traditional companies and notions of "the management".  Sharing leadership &amp; systems for swapping stewardship feel really vital to avoid burn out and for that longterm goal... </p>\n\n<p>One thing that helps is PATIENCE</p>\n\n<p>With ourselves - </p>\n\n<p>the last few years has been an extraordinarily painful personal learning about my weaknesses and ability to destroy my best efforts and not organise energy properly. Naivety is not helpful - I had a tendency to think that i could do many many things because I was animated by the feeling that it was vitally important. This feeling met the crushing realities of difference between people, everyday life, parenthood, resources and my real ineptness to use social media\u2026</p>\n\n<p>&amp; also patience with others </p>\n\n<p>and with how human beings actually are. </p>\n\n<p>I\'ve been on a great learning about personality and the limits of change. That well intentioned people might want to change, that knocks &amp; failures certainly help shed naivety, but that changing habitual patterns takes time and support and is rarely complete. There\'s this realism emerging - mainly people only partially learn things and have a habit of remembering just a few things... We all tend to get swamped by our own lives sometimes. I like to think that I learnt about the problems of \u201ctrying\u201d to make something happen over the last few years, but then I look at my current state of affairs &amp; realise that my tendency to "try" to make things happen and naive enthusiasm that this time it will all work out is still prompting my actions. Habits of action are engrained in our biology - there\'s a noticing and re-wiring that\'s possible... &amp; difficult. As I (and many others) re-wire ourselves with respect to what we do not do well and work out how to <em>genuinely</em> put energy to good use and work together, there\'s a kind of hardcore deathless patience that\'s needed. Because we have to keep aware and change ourselves and how we work, whilst keeping on doing. </p>\n\n<p>&amp; If I\u2019m going to be real - I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve noticed many people get astoundingly wiser about their own weaknesses or completely overcome the bits of their characters that tend to alienate, confuse, splinter, cause trouble for all. &amp; that\'s part of the melting pot of being human, making trouble, being part of the trouble...</p>\n\n<p>I wonder what a meeting that has a sense of complete and open welcome to everyone combined with a really compassionate understanding about people\u2019s limits and flaws might be. That feels like what you are aiming at in the Care Conversation. It feels a good place to start and avoids the problem we talked about around carers vs. those who need care. </p>\n\n<p><em>Mechanisms &amp; sessions to get people creating &amp; flowing</em></p>\n\n<p>I\'m really excited by the move at the OpenVillage to genuinely learn through courageous experiment and in friendship, with all the learning of the last decades.</p>\n\n<p>I\'d love to see group mechanisms for getting people to play to their strengths actively &amp; creatively within the Open Village, because social situations can tend to split into spectators and active agents and - often - some of the best people, don\'t have any idea of what their strengths actually are or that they are allowed to use them.  I\u2019ve packed up the idea that collaboration is going to be a balanced affair - but there\'s a joy in friendship, encouragement and acceptance of how other people are in the moment. </p>\n\n<p>I wonder what mechanisms / games / workshops / group actions can be put in place that gets people to flowing together. I\'d love to come and do some group dreamwork. Ie. An entirely optional session first thing in the morning to come and share the dreams that were had in the night. I\'ve been learning from Apela Colorado about this practice and can only say that although it would take me many years of practice to really say why this is so effective at group meetings, that I have found it to be so. Group systems for mutually holding the unconscious forces of a group might be useful to our tendencies to unwittingly sabotage our best &amp; most concerted efforts. Feel like I\'ve said this in the article I wrote, but I\'d love to facilitate some dream work sessions. &amp; really encourage the existence of group dance, meditation and other activities through the day.</p>\n\n<p>Surprising ways of getting the web of creativity going is one way of getting through the armour of pessimism.  I hear a lot of people these days, burnt by the failures of past ventures, getting bitter and hard and talking about having their fingers in many pies so as to avoid being too troubled if one doesn\'t work out. To me, this sounds like a strange new way of "not caring". We do have to CARE &amp; actively try hard to not make the same mistakes - non-attachment is one thing - but speculative gambling to avoid committing just leads to a whole load of nothing. It\'s such an inhibitor of potential. All our eggs are in one basket ... and the basket is on fire.</p>\n\n<p>There are many other effective ways of creating together and keeping the flow. </p>\n\n<p>A few from my experience -  </p>\n\n<p>Schumacher College <a href="https://www.schumachercollege.org.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.schumachercollege.org.uk/</a> vitalises their educational experience with student organised group meetings each morning where different people bring short physical practices &amp; games, readings to bring everyone into the new day &amp; it also serves to communicate a clear map for the day - what\'s happening, whose doing the food... It works. And you really notice how sometimes you just wake up negative and need to be heaved back into flow. They also have great healthy hearty habits of building fires, clothes swaps, making puddings, doing ritual, singing together, storytelling, dancing - it has a spiritual cohesion that is rare. On a less good tip - it\'s fucking expensive which leaves most people out of it.</p>\n\n<p>COP21 at the ZAD - self organisation that worked well mainly because of the urgency of the climate meeting &amp; a level of care &amp; focus given by the event following so shortly after the bombing in Paris.  The thing that made this one work so well was the shared commitment to a greater cause - it gave the space feeling of camaraderie, trust, helpfulness, gifting, community, sharing info.  </p>\n\n<p>The Chaos Computer Club in 2015 also had a similar community spirit, loads of people interacting with a will to experiment &amp; hack prototypes, set up spontaneous meetings, share experience, exchange networks, DANCE together - on a less good tip - well, there\'s everything about the negatives of technology culture, new elites rising, tech worship that has not yet plugged into wisdom and care...</p>\n\n<p>The Warp Experience in the 90s in London - this one really shifted me with its open, mind bending, hilarious &amp; inspiring concoction of theatre, workshops, talks, wild dance, a hot tub. It was a liberty space of organic flow, wild experimentation and spontaneous creativity. Like all expressions of liberty, liberty lasts a short while and then rots unless it is tended to transform into something else - and these negatives became more visible, there was no real help to those who were vulnerable (except the social radar that sometimes worked well), there was mental fall out, sexual predation, guru culture and power conflicts, hedonism culture always means lots of talk and less action and its got a shadow of addiction and escapism, and no one really understood how hard it would be or how long it would take...</p>\n\n<p>One conclusion I take from all this is that true creativity is the secret ingredient. The Warp may have been wild &amp; chaotic and bitten the dust but it spawned its seeds, to America and the Cosmic Trigger rising in the UK is all part of its growth through time. Real creative experience has organic effects that continue and seed new life, even if you can\'t account for them in reports - they often have much more power than really thought-through planned experiences... I\'ve certainly been to a lot of conferences and formal meetings which have not shifted me. </p>\n\n<p>Something that keeps coming  to me about the Open Village is TIME </p>\n\n<p>The question of - what lasts? what\'s useful? how can we inhabit this time with power?</p>\n\n<p>&amp; what\'s possible for October? Which is not so long away...</p>\n\n<p>I have one thought that keeps rising on taking this notion of the caring healthy self-organised group out into the city.   Few respond well to shouty negative activism. Fear is not the great communicator... Part of the cascade project was around slow culture hacks.  Activism that emphasises changing the pace of the city and foregrounding presence, vulnerability and the beauty of the earth. The dance groups on the streets for the COP21 shifted me.  </p>\n\n<p>Been thinking about action on the streets &amp; since culture is obsessed with excitement - anything too high paced is likely just to feed the machine and be yet another ride on the wheel... For where there is hectic business, there is all the distraction, blindness and madness of this suicidal culture.  This sense that \u201cthe time is now\u201d can be met by something present. Instead of putting that intense feeling into multiple short-lived projects, to make energy matter. To use energy with real intention. One way of spreading courage and alternatives is to be in total presence.  What about an action that expressed a great slowing down into presence during the Open Village? Slowing down the pace of the streets with movement. Done a few things like this before - I led a slow motion walk up Oxford high street in the last decade to protest the Iraq war. So - what about a short workshop and then an action of dancing slowly (in whatever your style) in the streets? Gifting pieces of fruit to passers by? A way of spreading the invitation. I\'ve made mistakes in the past about acting before the time is ripe. Doing too much. In rushed ways. Not preparing long enough to really pull it off. There is a mastery to carpe diem - in plucking the day when it is ripe. If that can tie in with urban game  you are working on - great - I\'m on for this &amp; looking out for times and places for this creative plan.</p>\n\n<p>Stripping things back. I think it is all about caring, realism and presence, and for me - whatever the outcome - joy. Events can unleash creative energy + knowledge. So I love events that combine enacting purpose with great up-to-date info exchange, tools and realistic sharing of experience &amp; melding that with infinite welcome, friendship and heartfelt (some might call it spiritual) unity. &amp; if we hit the sweet spot, participating in the network can catalyse personal understanding and meaning in the personal lives of all those that come participate - that\'s a good feedback loop.  Meeting together can open up new potentials for people to see how their own creativity can be part of meaningful radical action if it\'s held in a solid creative authentic container. The reason I got drawing chalk doors on the walls of Paris &amp; planting seeds across the city during cascade.network was to invoke this strength.  Doors where we see walls. Might be poetic. But the effort\'s so tough, it needs poetry.</p>\n\n<p>&amp; diversity!</p>\n\n<p>Whilst I am attempting to school myself in cybernetics to become a real structural thinker, I still think like a creative and have a lot to learn. A variety of very different kinds of people who share values &amp; can play to their strengths and accept the limits of others, might be more powerful than a group of people who are all exactly on the same page. Functional groups needs the grumpy pessimist, the young &amp; enthused, the spontaneous creative, the radical wild card, the focused logician, the butterfly generalist, the pragmatic parent, the radically honest, the contextualisers and historians, the future-thinkers, an elder and groups desperately needs the people who\'ve had it hardest and have learnt lessons most are lucky never to learn. My work - creative, research, teaching - has often kept me in a solitary pattern &amp; I\'m trying to break that pattern in myself as I truly come to understand that we not only need to know ourselves but we also need each other - in all our different forms - to make action together &amp; give that action the best possible support. </p>\n\n<p>These years have made me agnostic to style &amp; aesthetics. What moves me is whether someone means it, because then there\'s possibility for learning and acting. Commitment and care is a helluva lot more important than uniting over style or even personality. Commitment and care are solid foundations for the humility and superhuman patience to work with people you may not necessarily vibe with all the time...</p>\n\n<p>Ok - that\'s my attempt to share some experience.</p>\n\n<p>&amp; wait - my god - if I learnt anything from the Cascade it would be the communication. The project was an attempt to unite behind a purpose, act boldly and tell the story as we did it.  But my god, did I discover how terrible at leaving a documented trail I was. Spent a lot of time with sound artist Leah Barcalay who was tweeting for one of the massive eco twitter accounts during that conference. She\'d trained herself to tweet every minute or so. Open Village can make it easy for young people to attend and take up this communicative role - that would be a great idea. The social reach. The story told by many different storytellers. I was really naive about this when Cascading.</p>\n\n<p>&amp; beautiful documentation carries the spirit on into the future. Unmonastery felt pretty great at this - I was not involved at all in this project - but through the videos &amp; presentations that project moved me. &amp; this one <a href="http://www.open-frames.net/changing-tents/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.open-frames.net/changing-tents/</a></p>\n\n<p>Here are some events going on in the UK in August with some similar values -</p>\n\n<p>Balance Unbalance <a href="http://balance-unbalance2017.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://balance-unbalance2017.org/</a> - I\'m going to this, it\'s great</p>\n\n<p>Earth First! <a href="http://earthfirstgathering.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://earthfirstgathering.org/</a></p>\n\n<p>Intergalactic camp 17th-24th August</p>\n\n<aside class="onebox whitelistedgeneric">\n  <header class="source">\n    <a href="https://zadforever.blog/2017/07/13/come-to-the-intergalactic-week-17-24-august/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">zadforever.blog</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class="onebox-body">\n    <img src="https://i2.wp.com/zadforever.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/20160201_120635_hdr.jpg?fit=440%2C330&amp;ssl=1" width="690" height="387" class="thumbnail">\n\n<h3><a href="https://zadforever.blog/2017/07/13/come-to-the-intergalactic-week-17-24-august/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Come to the Intergalactic week 17-24 August</a></h3>\n\n<p>We are inhabitants of the zad who wish to strenghten connections and networks with groups and people from other countries.

If it was going to be an invite that people could answer and participate in without getting burnt out and becoming penniless in the process it needed some self-funding structure that could tend it &amp; support people who were on lower income... Experimenting with Brighton\'s GoodMoney or one of the ethical cryptocurrencies like FairCoin was the idea, but frankly I don\'t know enough about this. </p>\n\n<p>My main point here is that it is vital to support people in being able to take up a bold invitation - otherwise it\'s a radical possibility for those with the privilege to meet it, in that people live in a radically unequal context with totally different kinds of resources. If it\'s an open invite for people to make their own way to the "experiment" that risks only receiving folk who can commit to risks like that (eg. folks on PHD scholarships like me.) That\'s not healthy representative variety. &amp; many "utopian" meetings I attended over the decades died because they were basically wedded to capitalism and the inequalities of that system at their foundations. I\u2019m really interested how you guys are going to meet this problem. Nadia mentioned cryptos... &amp; I will catch up with Frank about this next week - about how people can be fairly supported to take up the invitation. In 2017, we all have to take risk. But we also gotta make the effort to try and share the level of risk - something that is a manageable risk to one person, might genuinely destroy another person\'s ability to survive. Looking forward to learning from you all on this.</p>\n\n<p>*If I copy edit your copy, can someone consider writing bullet point summaries of mine ; ) </p>\n\n<p>Short form writing is not my strength...</p>', u'post_id': 33306, u'date': u'2017-07-30 18:15:19'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'More about the Cascade project', u'comment_id': 33330, u'content': u'<p>Hei <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/kate_g">@kate_g</a> you surely have a way with words - maybe you are up for helping proofread or contribute to the mission statement/ invitation we will launch when releasing the first version of a program?</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve browsed through the Cascade website and it\'s not clear how your calls for participation were met by the community.\xa0I understand for about 6 months you ran events to re-activate Brighton in creative ways (<span class="hashtag">#CascadePortal</span>), then in spring/summer 2016 you attempted the 11 day action residency for which you didnt get funding and it completely stopped?

People feel they have more mental health concerns when they are in creative professions.</p>\n\n<p>Now we get an overview of content that relates to both of these issues.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/03b4c90b7a14bce81566b729f999f8674e938430" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/0/03b4c90b7a14bce81566b729f999f8674e938430.jpg" class="lightbox" title="IMG_0154.jpg"><img src="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/03b4c90b7a14bce81566b729f999f8674e938430_1_690x379.jpg" width="690" height="379"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">IMG_0154.jpg</span><span class="informations">1644x904 173 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>3000+ contributions in all on Edgeryders, very hard to filter through - Graphryder gives us an ethnological perspective: I would miss some of these connections if I didn\u2019t get this zoomed out view - instead of relying on individual memory, I can see how strong the link between these different concepts are, that I may not have known about.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the graph - there\u2019s a crucial link with safety and system failure - even though legal frameworks get in the way of DIY initiatives, there are existing regulatory frameworks to work within, which from an anthropological point of view is interesting.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>tag</strong> view is really useful for seeing relations between nodes. By digging into care we can find a different angle of discussion on health, the design interventions node points us to smartphone based healthcare apps:</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/7364d4d67c41d43c30547c01a65832f48a00e3bd" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7364d4d67c41d43c30547c01a65832f48a00e3bd.jpg" class="lightbox" title="FullSizeRender 3.jpg"><img src="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/7364d4d67c41d43c30547c01a65832f48a00e3bd_1_690x456.jpg" width="690" height="456"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">FullSizeRender 3.jpg</span><span class="informations">1137x753 54.4 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>There are three different views: one for users, one for content, one for tags. </p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Detangler</strong> view lets you see the intensity of the conversation around subjects.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/6ee45f36ed418307693c89eaf087844ab96d0983" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6ee45f36ed418307693c89eaf087844ab96d0983.jpg" class="lightbox" title="FullSizeRender 4.jpg"><img src="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6ee45f36ed418307693c89eaf087844ab96d0983_1_690x415.jpg" width="690" height="415"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">FullSizeRender 4.jpg</span><span class="informations">1864x1122 208 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>Alberto</strong>: Benefit to local network analysis in ethnography - my instinct is to try and get information on the network as a whole - that\u2019s what humans can\u2019t do. Anyone can keep track of a local track of ten nodes or so - what is unique is the global connectivity pattern - a pretty close call for collective intelligence. My problem with the detangler view: hints at regularities, but stops ahead of the finishing line, which would be to say, these connections between nodes correspond to a social network, then you compute the social network metrics which has something to say about the connectivity. Ex: validation to interaction, if the social network is connected, we can hope, people have been debunking the connections between the two nodes, therefore we know the network is solid. You use it to calculate a reliability score of the reliability between the nodes on the social network.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amelia</strong>: There are different kinds of interactions that are valuable. A few people discussing a topic might be more valuable, if they have a deep and intense knowledge of the topic, we wouldn\u2019t want to discard them just because they are a small group talking about insulin and open research. Allowing for a way to display that importance is pretty important to me from an ethnographic perspective.</p>\n\n<p>For example: mental health and creativity are closely looped - it seems a lot of people are talking about it. Is it an intensive or distributed conversation? </p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/bbc53c9e1c7e75b9935eee86b084b0234bab97bc" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bbc53c9e1c7e75b9935eee86b084b0234bab97bc.jpg" class="lightbox" title="FullSizeRender 5.jpg"><img src="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bbc53c9e1c7e75b9935eee86b084b0234bab97bc_1_690x414.jpg" width="690" height="414"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">FullSizeRender 5.jpg</span><span class="informations">1581x949 119 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>From an approximation: it\'s a very diversified social network, looks like the link between mental health and creativity has been discussed and debunked quite a bit.

I wanted to share this for those who are fully clear on the mechanics yet. Below is a simple schematic and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_51GdQ-X3JzN0lqMHVaZVlXMnZ2Z2ZiSlB1WXFCOC1QVnA0/view?usp=sharing">here\'s a more detailed vector map</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Basically it comes down to this: for expressing proinsulin, the bacteria needs T7 polymerase (which is a molecule needed for turning DNA into a protein) and a spot to bind to the plasmid DNA. The bacteria has to produce T7 polymerase itself (that\'s why we need a specific type of bacteria, such as BL21 or TG1, that does this). We control production\xa0through making the binding spot available or not.</p>\n\n<p>The T7 polymerase can only bind to the T7 promotor, which leads to production of proinsulin, when the binding spot\xa0is not repressed. Adding IPTG, which works on the\xa0"lac" part on the plasmid, makes sure the T7 promotor is not repressed. IPTG is our induction agent in this case: when we add it, proinsulin production starts.</p>\n\n<p>The "his tag" is for purification of the protein after it was expressed.\xa0The amp gene is for\xa0ampiciline resistance so that when we add ampiciline\xa0(an antibiotic) to the growth medium, we are sure the surviving bacteria have our plasmid\xa0(those bacteria that don\'t have the plasmid are not resistant).</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/88fc5aa3a712092264e487f198184390626cfdf3" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/8/88fc5aa3a712092264e487f198184390626cfdf3.jpg" class="lightbox" title="wp_20170720_17_53_47_pro_1.jpg"><img src="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/8/88fc5aa3a712092264e487f198184390626cfdf3_1_280x500.jpg" width="280" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">wp_20170720_17_53_47_pro_1.jpg</span><span class="informations">916x1632 265 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>Finally, we went over the required materials one last time and we\'re good to go for starting experiments in August when we have access to the lab!</p>', u'post_id': 33303, u'date': u'2017-07-20 16:10:00'}, {u'user_id': 3367, u'title': u'Conscious and creation', u'comment_id': 33353, u'content': u'<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/ewoudvenema">@ewoudvenema</a> Thanks for the video and post. \xa0I\'m curious to learn more about your connections between creation and resilience? \xa0How do you view them being connected? \xa0How do you see creation as a process of mental health practice? \xa0What do you think the next steps will be for your course? \xa0Thanks alot and looking forward to hearing from you. \xa0</p>', u'post_id': 876, u'date': u'2017-07-19 14:53:32'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'"Is it for me?"', u'comment_id': 6779, u'content': u"<p>Me, I've never tried anything like it.</p>\n\n<p>It might help if you have a call for people who havent experienced, in practice, to be conscious in the same way you probably have, since\xa0you use the term.</p>\n\n<p>Did you have an idea which progressed somewhere thanks to you being so aware?

When I start to think about the dissonances between my own thinking / feeling / being and that of others around me, I feel quickly drawn in to defensive justification of my own position, which makes describing the other points of view more difficult to do in any kind of fair way. I try to maintain my own inner harmony by muting the dissonant voices; by invalidating them in my own mind. Alternatively, and sadly, we simply stop resonating with our own truth, and let it be silenced \u2014 drowned out \u2014 by the prevailing hymns.

Particularly in a community like ours, there is also a great wealth of experience, much of which has already been distilled into wisdom. If we were able to access this wisdom, many would be helped along our ways.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s a two-way process, of course. On some occasions we could greatly benefit from the experience and wisdom of others, and on other occasions they might benefit from ours.</p>\n\n<p>And it\'s more than two-way. One person\'s wisdom is often shallow, constrained by the very life experience from which the wisdom comes. If we are lucky -- for instance if that other person is a skilled therapist -- they may be very helpful. But in a peer-to-peer world, it seems better to rely on plurality. The more people whose wisdom we have access to, the more likely it is that one of them will be able to "speak to our condition".</p>\n\n<p>So what\'s the essence of the issue here? To me, there seem to be social and cultural barriers preventing the full realisation of this passing on of the wisdom of experience. But also there are time constraints. Maybe one challenge could be to find ways of finding people who have more to offer us; or conversely, finding people who we are more likely to be able to help effectively.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s a puzzle, and I would be delighted to read the reflections of others about this puzzle, or even suggestions from your experience, or collective wisdom, on how to address the issues.</p>', u'post_id': 830, u'date': u'2017-07-07 14:45:44'}, {u'user_id': 200, u'title': u'Laloux, NVC and organisations', u'comment_id': 28470, u'content': u'<p>Hi <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/gehan">@Gehan</a>, thanks for mentioning Laloux. Yes, many people into NVC seem also to value his perspective, particularly those who are interested in bringing NVC-type techniques into the workplace. My partner is looking at this area, and is also impressed by Miki Kashtan -- not read by me yet though! She is pursuing certified NVC practitioner status, and is now well connected with the NVC scene in the UK. She is one of the ones who did the RC training and helps host Circles here.</p>\n\n<p>Your work with organisations looks really interesting, and I\'d like to learn more. Yes, there is plenty of overlap with the collective or organisational mental health of any group of people in regular interaction. The quality of that interaction is highly significant. And there are skills there to be learned and practiced -- that\'s part of my understanding of the basic approach of NVC.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe there are several potential sources of cognitive (or affective?) dissonance, in 1-1 relationships as well as in groups, and again it could be seen as a branch of communication skills to address that dissonance and foster harmony (one of my favourite words <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ). What I don\'t know enough about is how to help people (including myself) see the distorted views of themselves which contribute to dissonances in others as well as themselves. 1-1 interactions can so easily stall.

Many relevant themes. We\'ve tried a bit of restorative circles too - though the people we work\xa0with nicknamed it \'Conflict Kitchen\' because of the way the guy who\xa0introduced it to us described it - in that conflict is natural we just need somewhere to go with it - just as eating is natural and we go to the kitchen when we want to prepare food. We\'re still figuring out how to bed it in. I\'ve also worked a bit with NVC and follow <a href="http://thefearlessheart.org/">Miki Kashtan\'s</a> work most. I think the question you highlight in relation to Opencare is very pertinent - "how we engage with our own and each other\'s well-being". I\'m also wondering if you\'re already tuned in to Laloux\'s <a href="http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/">Reinventing Organisations</a> - the passages on wholeness practices seem particularly relevant to what you mention about growing a culture that supports collective &amp; mutual wellbeing. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>Thanks <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> for the link to the Enspiral Stewarding Circle - it looks like it\'ll shed light on something we\'ve been wrestling in to reality for a while - we\'ve been envisioning it as a \'network of fives\' like a beehive. The question we\'ve been aware of is how to create enough framework around peer-to-peer care without overformalising it and so it\'s interesting that others have been working with\xa0this balance too.</p>\n\n<p>Mental health is an ongoing focus within our working community too. <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/woodbinehealth">@Woodbinehealth</a> - I\'m guessing you\'ve come across the\xa0<a href="http://theicarusproject.net/">Icarus Project</a> - I love their work and came across it when issues around how we define mental health became overwhelmingly\xa0real for my family. I love the way they frame their work as "by and for people who experience the world in ways that are often diagnosed as mental illness". I feel that this way of describing what we all experience at times when our mental health is stretched creates enough space so that people are not defined by their diagnosis.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Its contributed to my ongoing reflections on an organisation\'s mental health. I wonder if this is what you refer to when you say "collective mental health"? I\'ve noticed that the organisation\'s mental health seems unwell when there is too great a distance between various peoples perceptions of the organisations reality and its relationship to the world. It feels too big a gap and too likely to contribute to mutliple organisational personalities that can often be at odds with each other. We\'ve recently concluded a year long collaborative process that has generated really embedded alignment in core things like values, the assumptions and context we\'re responding to. The mental health of the organisation is noticeably improved.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that these conversations will continue up to and during the event in October.

Hopefully RC should lead to rebuilding trust, but that cannot be more than a hope at this stage. I have also personally been involved in informal mediation between different parties in drawing up a food policy for our shared spaces that respects both vegans (some of whom are highly sensitive to the presence of meat and fish in their eating space) and others who feel they need non-vegetarian food for their health and well-being.

On the other hand, I value genuine heartfelt commitment, where you commit to staying (unless there is unavoidable danger or intolerable hardship in staying). As we become more economically interdependent (as I think we will be as our current economy unravels) we need to recognise as well that moving out is really hard to arrange sometimes. As it was in the old days for women in marriage. I\'m not saying go back there, I am saying let\'s all work hard on doing the work of growth and development in ourselves and in relationship, so that there is (nearly) always a viable option for staying, supporting commitment. I happen to believe that this kind of commitment is also very good in the long term for our spiritual growth.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this makes sense of the importance I put on the living community, compared with the working community. We have got used to the idea that employment comes and goes. I would say, let\'s not get used to the idea that relationships and communities come and go, but instead that we all grow within them, and we find ways of strongly supporting other people growing as well. Hopefully, I look forward to this leading to stronger and more stable working relations as well, so that we can then have more long-term work stability.

But those four are not part of the formal agreement from what I could see.</p>\n\n<p>Those four are daunting to put into an agreement to say the least. \xa0And maybe the group or the founders don\'t want such things to be formalised not because it is hard, but because it is better to not get formal with them.</p>\n\n<p>But the process for joining involves a lot of face time with community members over a number of visits and meetings. \xa0I assume that when it comes to\xa0a vote \xa0for admitting someone, most everyone considers the whole person and whether or not they will be good cohousing companions.</p>\n\n<p>But disagreements happen. \xa0Things go unsaid and build up. \xa0So what then?</p>\n\n<p>My experience in community is different from yours in that I lived for a number of years in a total collective that described itself as a "spiritual community." \xa0It was based around a charismatic leader/teacher who did in fact have quite a lot of say in just about whatever he wanted - which was a lot. \xa0Still, we were a large group\xa0(we started at about 200 and grew over the course of 8-9 years to about 1500) and since we shared everything it was a matter of survival that at the household, work crew and personal level we have a\xa0day-to-day way of resolving conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>I need to say at this point that we could not sustain ourselves as a collective (for a variety of reasons I won\'t go into here). \xa0After 12 years we "fired" the guru and changed into a cooperative that exists to this day, though most of us are not formal members.\xa0 \xa0But we did get good enough at the process of bonding that included intense "working it out" that our tribe outlasted the structure. \xa0And the tribe that lives somewhere else (concentrations in northern California where we started, Austin TX and around\xa0NYC) outnumbers those who remain on the land in Tennessee. \xa0But the tribe\xa0itself is strong and real among us in a way that has not diminished regardless of where we live.</p>\n\n<p>We live all over now but the deep bonds didn\'t diminish. \xa0They were built day by day, hour by hour living and depending on each other.</p>\n\n<p>We never got very formal about codifying how people get along except we did follow some simple age-old practices.</p>\n\n<p>The basic thing we started with\xa0was an allegiance to the truth. \xa0Not in a religious sense per se (as in "I am the Truth, the Way, etc"), but just that every person was going to try to be as truthful as possible with themselves and everyone around them.</p>\n\n<p>Next, compassion. \xa0People who live together, and don\'t want to be a bunch of robots, need to find ways of being ok with each other\'s ways of being. As it said in a recent artticle about why Findhorn has lasted so long one guy said, "everyone is willing to look at their stuff."\xa0</p>\n\n<p>And, we agreed that the vibes matter. \xa0Not that everyone is going to be fake nice all the time, but that human consideration very much includes the\xa0vibrational space between people and is thus open to discussion as much as any material item.</p>\n\n<p>A group may\xa0agree (tacitly or by not adhering to anything that isn\'t in a written agreement)\xa0or, a group may just settle over time, into a state of\xa0<em>not</em> pointing out when someone bothers you, or you can see that the other person is playing some sort of game or being manipulative, or being afraid to say something, or just not having the energy for it, then resentments\xa0build up. \xa0At a group level it can get factional. \xa0Let it go too far and it wrecks the social bonds.</p>\n\n<p>One problem with individuals and groups is not knowing what is, and is not, ok to talk about. In our community we went the route that there is nothing one cannot bring up. \xa0High risk for sure. \xa0Thus we got a lot of practice\xa0doing this with many screwups and many satisfying sessions.</p>\n\n<p>In deciding whether or not to say something inconvenient to someone, we thought it best to start by considering, is it helpful? \xa0Is it kind? \xa0How much of my impression is really coming from the other person and not from my reaction to it? \xa0The last one is important because in an honest discussion one\'s motives for bringing something up very often get questioned, like it or not.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>If we couldn\'t come to terms, or a good feeling, we agreed that any one of us would act as a fairwitness to try to arrive at a place where everyone feels good and right and it\'s fine to move on.</p>\n\n<p>And if that didn\'t work we would expand the circle. \xa0Since we lived close together that often happened organically. \xa0Without having any statistics, I think we did resolve huge numbers of disagreements.</p>\n\n<p>I guess because we called ourselves a "spritual community" that embraced a very eclectic mix of sources (we were hippies after all), we would often advocate for our various points of view using tenets of other religious and spiritual practices as references.</p>\n\n<p>One of them was the Buddhst idea of not getting caught up in "praise and blame." \xa0This translated for us that in giving and receiving feedback, we should stay mindful to not give or take either praise or blame. \xa0When delivered with compassion then, it mitigates the perennial problem of somene feeling attacked and then defensive on one side and on the other\xa0the person giving the feedback delivering it with aggression as if to say "I blame you for this problem." \xa0(Or infinate variations of these and more.) It is hard to both give and receive feedback, so there can never be too much empathy.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this doesn\'t sound too patronising. \xa0It looks to me from the pictures of the members that your community is loaded with great people who surely have great understanding of how to get along.</p>\n\n<p>I guess this was my long-winded way of\xa0saying that if nothing is formal as to how one is to behave with others and how people are to deal with certain relationship problems, much can be achieved if there is a general consensus that it\'s ok to say things to each other about the more subtle mental and "vibratory" aspects of living together and that it will get a fair hearing and be delivered with kindness, even if one is annoyed. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>One thing I do know about why one should not avoid conflict if something needs to be talked over, is that relationships with any history of resolving conflict are stronger because built into the bond is the\xa0knowledge that\xa0you can resolve something because you actually did it.</p>', u'post_id': 830, u'date': u'2017-05-11 17:56:00'}, {u'user_id': 3374, u'title': u'Some thoughts <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ', u'comment_id': 8009, u'content': u'<p>Hello <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/asimong">@asimong</a>,</p>\n\n<p>The issues you\'re facing in your cohousing community actually sound a lot like the type we face in my university, especially how to align views on wellbeing when everyone comes from varied backgrounds, with sometimes completely\xa0divergent perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>One thing we\'ve taken to doing, in order to give a space for the range of views and thoughts\xa0on these topics is we hold semesterly <a href="https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/teaching-strategies/fishbowl" rel="nofollow noopener">fishbowl discussions</a>.

Along those lines, I think you might be interested in looking into bystander training, where members of your community who are interested can learn how to best support people, and connect them to the care they need.

And why it disappeared with modernity. According to him it\xa0was basically held together by the need to manage an important resource- water.</p>\n\n<p>In Matera there is a huge man-made underground reservoir of water, and a system for accessing it through wells. Each well is situated in a courtyard shared by a number of individual family houses. They collectively manage their shared well and according to him this was the key reason as to why there was\xa0such a strong sense of neighbourhood and mutual care amongst residents. Because of the day to day interaction and mutual dependence on one another to responsibly manage the shared resource. When the state moved people into modern dwelling (in the 80\'s?) then they had running water etc. No need for daily interaction and no dependency - the system broke.</p>\n\n<p>They also did things like ran communal bakeries instead of having individual ovens. I would say these are examples of cultures of collaboration born out of material necessity. This has been consistent with my own experience around how collaboration happens. It doesn\'t happen without a compelling reason... The enspiral crowd is running an interesting experiment.

Personally, even though I\'m no giant, I love contributing to these really new trans- or inter-disciplinary areas. I was deeply impressed, around 1975, reading "Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems" by Jerome R. Ravetz, originally from 1971. Rom Harr\xe9 used to recommend it in his lectures in Oxford.\xa0 It had a great chapter headed "Immature and ineffective fields of inquiry" (you can get some results from searching for the phrase in quotes) which set out some of the dangers, and excitements, of these areas.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s easy to imagine this is all about giants, and maybe it used to be, but I don\'t think that is so any more. The world (of knowledge) has grown so vast, no one is a giant anymore. If instead we constitute ourselves as collaborative, cooperative intelligent ants, though, I think we can make progress. Ants (real ones) do so much with so little individual intelligence. What could we do, if we were to coordinate with the power of ants? This links so well across our discussions ... it is the culture of collaboration that is key, and that in turn rests on how we interact day to day -- "micro" level, you could say. To me, it involves deep listening to each other, just as care more generally does. It involves co-creating, and co-managing, a culture in which the commons is held in higher regard than the individual, and where the commons wisdom knows who to ask about particular issues; where we all help to redirect, rather than individualistically claiming intellectual territory for ourselves. In the network, some people are valuable more as nodes, others more as links.</p>\n\n<p>My personal interest in the thread might start off by asking about the nature, the provenance and the governance of tags themselves.</p>', u'post_id': 6483, u'date': u'2017-07-15 03:39:22'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'New fields are for giants', u'comment_id': 33372, u'content': u'<p>... not for the likes of me.

Even if it is small, it is probably enough to ensure interesting work and a measure of prosperity.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for pointing to the text you wrote. The distinction does not really apply here, because one of the ingredients of our method, ethnography, is, by your definition, itself trans. I guess that makes SSNA "meta", or something! But the way I think of it is rather inter: let ethno people do their thing as normal, let network people also do their thing as normal, and\xa0<em>then</em>\xa0build a new layer on top of it that enhances both and brings about a new synthesis. Problem is, to interpret the new layer (SSNA itself) you need to speak both languages.

Then it makes sense explaining it in terms your intended user base understands.\xa0If it\'s part of a new field, it makes sense to explain it in and of itself. A field being a set of methods, people, language, ... that have crossed some threshold.\xa0Then there\'s less\xa0need to justify its usefulness for another field or set of users.</p>\n\n<p>The line is blurry because it\'s interdisciplinary research: you\'re building new tools. Thinking about it more deeply, it makes sense to me to place what you\'re doing in a spectrum from monodisciplinary research to transdisciplinary research.\xa0<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KCHRLWsPe6Wx7EOsTuC5zWN52X2BESlkIvs38028UZI/edit?usp=sharing">This excerpt</a> from my workshop on interdisciplinary collaboration &amp; communication explains a little.\xa0It seems to me you\'re doing the interdisciplinary thing, but not yet to the extent it can be considered a new field?</p>\n\n<p>For me this classification in terms of mono, inter, trans is tied to communication efforts. In the mushroom material research, Elise and I went\xa0from multidisciplinary to interdisciplinary and ultimately transdisciplinary. Now we\'re at the point where we actively involve society in the research through workshops &amp; outreach. Initially our communication with each other had to improve, then to other professionals (eg. designers, biologists) and ultimately to the public (hobbyists, children, ...). It took progressively more effort in terms of communication and practical things: translating experiments into digestible, accessible\xa0activities for people to interact with). I feel like the payoff is there (we get ideas, connections, an audience, ...), but going that far with communication does take a lot of time. We can do it because I\'m not involved in the lab research anymore, only as project manager for outreach\xa0and missions.</p>\n\n<p>There is of course also the argument that what has been researched using tax money should be made accessible and understandable apart from there being a payoff for your research by\xa0involving society.</p>\n\n<p>Making complex information understandable takes time, so the most economical solution is to define your audience and write for them, rather than for any\xa0audience. The latter means taking into account the group that has the hardest time understanding, without compromising in content or form\xa0too much for any group. That is hard and you always end up losing detail or nuance. You wouldn\'t write so that an 8 year old could understand you, even if you were perfectly capable, unless your plan is to go specifically to them with your post.</p>\n\n<p>A\xa0technical person is okay with a separate glossary page.

I see the distinction between result (good potential to be\xa0relevant for a non-expert) and analysis tool (less potential to be relevant for a non-expert), yet it comes down to your own ambitions, judgment and\xa0what you want to say to whom.</p>\n\n<p>So all in all, I understand the communication aspect in this context in terms of\xa0where you\'re at with the research (new field\xa0or not?

When we were writing <a href="https://github.com/opencarecc/scaling-digital-ethnography/blob/master/INSCI%202017%20submission/insci-2017-opencare.pdf">the methodological paper</a>, I realised there are\xa0<em>no</em>\xa0experts on this stuff. Some people understand ethnography. Other understand networks. Almost no one understands both. Even in the research group we tend to be either-or, with maybe a vague idea of what the other camp is all about (and the vast majority of humanity, of course, understands neither, nor does it care). That leaves us with two strategies: either we write in a heavily context-dependent way (explain ethnography when submitting to netsci journals, explain graphs when submitting to anthro journals); or we assume that no one knows anything at all. In the case in point, we were submitting to something called the Internet Science\xa0Conference. Whatever the hell Internet Science is, it is unwise to assume an audience that understands networks like <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/melancon">@melancon</a> , or ethno like <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/amelia">@Amelia</a> . So, we actually introduce all concepts (not bad for a 7 pages paper!):</p>\n\n<p><em>Ethnography is a qualitative research technique aimed at discovering how a certain group of humans perceives a set of issues [...]</em></p>\n\n<p>So: what you propose is relatively simple to implement, though we would definitely have different pages for the background information. Actually, I already added <a href="https://github.com/opencarecc/graph-ryder-dashboard/wiki/SSNA-Key-concepts">a page</a> on key concepts. Why, the wiki is three hours old! But my question to you (and all) is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this interesting for people who are not involved with ethno/anthro/qualitative research?\xa0</strong>Should we even make the effort to talk to them?\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Final remark for <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/winnieponcelet">@WinniePoncelet</a> and the "science communication" crowd in Reagent and elsewhere. I am def no expert, but I find that you cannot dumb down the "how did you get this result" question more than so much. For example, a much simpler work like my own network analys of Horizon 2020 consortia looks like <a href="https://github.com/spaghetti-open-data/ODFest2017-horizon2020-network/wiki">this</a>. Going all out on it, restricting myself to only one result, spending time in crafting a nice viz, writing with Hemingway App, etc. I managed to get to <a href="http://www.cottica.net/2017/07/04/the-horizon-2020-tribes-partnership-building-and-network-assortativity-in-european-research-funding/">this</a>.

Also what works well is to set a clear invitation and some simple guidelines, such as the ones I described. They help the group process and give a certain structure to build up momentum.\xa0My experiences have been diverse. I\'ve experienced beautiful gatherings where love, depth and understanding were shared among all participants. Sometimes when the group was mixed deeply sharing also lead to some confusion as these depths were not familiar to everyone and not everyone seemed to grasp the depth of the experience of someone else. Although I think it didn\'t harm or shock anyone too much, I do think it may have lead to some confusion. For instance, I once went very deep receiving the talking stick and staying silent for a few minutes, all attention on me, I didn\'t want to "just say something" so I stayed present with my inner dynamics (and doubts) in front of everyone. Finally, I said something that felt true to me. So I remained connected to my inner truth. The woman who was sitting next to me didn\'t know how quick she had to say something when I gave her the talking stick. Ever since our contact between me and the woman have been somewhat weird. Coming to think of it, I should have probably talked to her sometime and exchange perspectives lightly.... <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> (oops).\xa0</p>\n\n<p>This particular meeting was organized by a friend of mine btw and was a gathering of about 20 people, which is quite big for such a sharing. I\'d say depending on the size of the group there will be different forms and formats that suit best the conversation. Not necessarily the bigger the group to more superficial. Groups can go very deep together when they are guided properly. This is a true art. And ideally, one question/ sharing leads to another, being able to deepen the conversation coming closer to opennings. And, maybe most importantly everything is good. So not resisting anything nor having an agenda helps for creating the space to be who you naturally are.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I believe the Circles of openness serve best around a certain theme that is loaded and which everyone has experiences with: I organized a series about money and I participated in one about sexuality. Both topics lead to a very vulnerable and warm sharing and brought everyone closer together. Also I think Circles work well for existing communities that work or live together, as tensions may arise during the daily practices. The latter I have some experiences with at the Synergyhub and the principle we used was to share from what\'s alive in you at the moment. This worked pretty well.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I also initiated a circle once during a workshop where people didn\'t really know each other and there wasn\'t a real theme or topic. In that setting it didn\'t feel really appropriate to do a sharing, as apart from being human and sharing a similar human experience (so there\'s always (some) interest), \xa0there wasn\'t really a common intention or relevance to have this talk together. So I wouldn\'t organize a circle "out of the blue" again.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Most of the meetings I was with had both familiar people and strangers. As long as the intention for the meeting is clear, it\'s no problem and good examples will follow.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Most circles I went to lasted for about 1 to 2 hours. Although probably you know about retreats/ satsangs for instance with Bentinho Massaro that take about the whole day (with sessions of about 1,5 to 2 hours each). Have to say that during these days Bentinho (or some other "teacher) is the one who does most of the talking. Yet, he knows how to bring a group into depth. So, even though it\'s a different form, there\'s also huge transformation happening during these meetings.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/nadia">@Nadia</a> about organizing this at The Reef. I would say a circle is very appropriate and effective if there is a theme or topic that has great interest. When this is the case, we can do it. You could also guide it yourself if you feel excited.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>And is there a learning curve, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> ? Yes, for me personally very much. Through sharing so openly in a public space among others really gave me confidence to be vulnerable and fully present. Also for many others I feel sharing with each other has this effect. During some of my meetings I really saw people transform, releasing some of the doubts and limiting beliefs they had about themselves! Truly magical to be there when that happens! Moments I have very exciting and warm memories of.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>So let me summarize my experiences:\xa0\xa0</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Sharing from personal experiences - yet not getting caught up into the story. The aim is to gain clarity to let go of stories and have space te create the new.\xa0</p></li>\n<li><p>Circles work well around certain (loaded) theme\'s and communities who work/ life together with a clear invitation.\xa0</p></li>\n<li><p>Listening from the heart, listening from beyond the personal perspective (not taking anything personal)</p></li>\n<li><p>Everything that pops up from a genuine sharing is welcome, even if it\'s off topic.

We can all agree on the protocol as a goal, what happens with it afterwards is up to the user. In this stage, it is desirable that the way we get there does not jeopardize\xa0the use some of the team members have in mind (or at least minimally).</p>\n\n<p>Cheap insulin is one of the\xa0reasons, but a precedent for more of this kind of research is also a reason, as this could decrease the cost of many more medicines. We can only guess, but I doubt the lesson Novartis would draw is "we need to do more open research"\xa0after they pick\xa0up half-finished open knowledge and successfully turn it into a product or profit. From releasing a somewhat finished protocol into the world, they might still not take that message away, but more citizen researchers might be inclined to, and keep the effort going.\xa0It becomes an optimization problem to balance\xa0short term and long term economic benefits, taking the strategy to get there into account.</p>\n\n<p>The comparison of the dynamics in\xa0software is fair, but that is not to say that there is not a more favorable outcome. The stakes are also higher when considering medicine. The difference between having or not having a piece of software is not death.</p>\n\n<p>On 3: agreed to an extent. There is a lot of wickedness in the biotech industry. Research is very slow and expensive, almost as extreme as it gets. The dynamics do change at these extremes, I think, and that asks for a different strategy. To break through, accumulating small wins in an iterative way might not be ideal.\xa0Reaching a particular benchmark that actually matters big time (eg. the first open source production protocol for insulin) perhaps would be.</p>\n\n<p>Volunteer time can drastically undercut the cost, and make this type of research more efficient than what a Novartis could hope for. We already seeing signs of that in the DIYbio movement. But\xa0we are still learning how to leverage the\xa0advantage. Hardware, software and wetware are definitely enabling us at this point, but are also still developing. Hopefully these things are bringing us to a tipping point, quicklier than the large companies are.</p>\n\n<p>I think this is still a learning phase, where there are vulnerabilities\xa0on several fronts.

No one can fault an open source project for bad or missing documentation, only praise it when it does it right.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>There is no opennness without letting go of control. Keep your eyes on the ball: if your goal is cheap insulin, or shoes that reap the health benefits of barefoot walking, you win even if it is Novartis or Nike delivering it. In open source, most people consider that open source is winning exactly because business uses it (and, now, contributes to maintaining it). Linux is everywhere except your laptop; if you are hellbent on open source, or cost-sensitive, you can also get a Linux laptop, with Linux being free as in both speech and beer.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Open cannot be closed again. If you don\'t like what Novartis did with your data and you thing you can do better/cheaper, your data are still there and still open. You can still go ahead and undercut them.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>That said, you can take a "free" as opposed to "open" approach, and use nc or nc-sa licenses. This means people can reuse your data, but are prohibited from doing anything commercial with it; additionally, with sa (share alike) any new entity that incorporates your data inherits their license, so all "children" dataset stay noncommercial forever. The Creative Commons website has a handy <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">wizard</a> for choosing your preferrred license.\xa0These days, noncommercial licenses are\xa0<em>not</em>\xa0considered open licenses according to the Open Definition. With Creative Commons licenses, additional usage rights can always be negotiated with the rights holder. So, you can put out data with a nc license; if Novartis thinks they are so valuable and want to use them to develop a drug, they have to come to you and ask for a different license. At that point you decide what to do. Of course, it is difficult to monitor that they do not just syphon the data up and do whatever they want anyway, but hopefully the regulation is tight enough that they will consider not worth the risk of being caught out.\xa0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>I\'d love to help with your data strategy. OpenCare\'s works <a href="https://github.com/opencarecc/opencare-data-documentation">like this</a>.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 6412, u'date': u'2017-06-15 10:14:45'}, {u'user_id': 3362, u'title': u'Re: open data', u'comment_id': 11937, u'content': u'<p>That\'s a valid point <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/rachel">@Rachel</a> . Although I am a big fan of documentation, I have personally not given it too much thought for OI. Partly because the group in Oakland took the approach of not having an open and rolling documentation repository. Partly because it seemed like too big an effort for now, when\xa0we are already struggling with managing all the information we do and don\'t have.</p>\n\n<p>I am also reminded of an interesting aspect of openness. A researcher I know, has a huge dataset on barefoot walking by indigenous communities. The Nikes of this world would pay big cash to have it. She believes in open source, however, opening up the dataset would mean only the Nikes could really exploit the data,\xa0thanks\xa0to their size. Smaller companies can\'t do much with the\xa0data (they don\'t have eg. the $10,000 3D printer for it) and the indigenous communities can\'t either. There is skewness in the situation: a huge relative difference in resources, a huge financial incentive and no community of peers that is in a position to contribute to the commons. For all good measure, opening up the data would be\xa0closer to a transaction (a gift, even).</p>\n\n<p>The same factors are at play\xa0for Open Insulin. If at one point, an experiment proves promising, a biotech company could take it from there and easily be faster. The peers (like the Belgium group) who want to contribute, can contribute though, but by getting more closely involved. At the end everything can be released, and hopefully this will shift some of the factors at play. Paving the way for a new way of protein engineering\xa0is also a goal of Open Insulin.</p>\n\n<p>Not sure if there\'s good answers, I\'d love to discuss this more.</p>', u'post_id': 6412, u'date': u'2017-06-15 08:05:00'}, {u'user_id': 3704, u'title': u'open data', u'comment_id': 10027, u'content': u'<p>There is a debate about what really constitutes \'open\' research still, certainly. \xa0<a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/winnieponcelet">@WinniePoncelet</a> \xa0The response to the FAQ question \'where is the data?\' as \'It will be released when the time is there.

One of the things we are going to do in the next week or so is to work to develop the main ideas we hope this title expresses.  So I will attempt to do so here, but more in-depth work will come out.  I think the points that are raised are very valid and I think fundamental to our collective development of what it would mean to live and work together as the original title described.  </p>\n\n<p>By communism, we are not referring to the ideals of communists, most of whom were essentially socialists vying for state power to then institute some utopian form of communism.  So that communism was only possible after some transition period, and the accumulation of power.  Both of which are false assumptions, proven over and over again by history.  Be it Ethiopia, USSR, Cuba, or China, these leaders took power by whatever means, in an attempt to take over "means of production".  But the problem is not who owns the means, it is the means themselves.  What we mean by "communism" is the ancient form of communism.  The form of communism that arises in close knit neighborhoods, the form that Occupy, the Squares movement, and historically, the Spanish anarchists all exemplified.  It is the development of common needs and the sharing of resources and property to meet those ends.  I would argue that communism is our natural form of life if we consider the indigenous ways of life as well as the natural trend towards communism that occurs after natural disasters.  And so when we say "living communism" it is a nod to this way of life, having nothing to do with state power and the crimes committed in its name.  </p>\n\n<p>As for the strategic use of rhetoric, I absolutely agree that there is a strategy around that selection.   When we argue for "spreading anarchy", it is not necessarily the "Black Bloc" that we are supporting.  Nor is it the adolescent who wants to do "whatever they want" mentality of some so called anarchists.  Rather what we are arguing is that anarchy as a form of organizing is fundamental to how we live.  OpenCare is working to highlight decentralized groups that self-organized, most without any state support and that will aim to provide their services or goods for minimal costs, separated from the capitalist model.  I would argue that this is in form "anarchist" in that there is autonomy within groups to create their own rules, there is a lack of hierarchical structure, and the goods produced are for the commons.    </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the terms "communism" and "anarchy" have both been painted so negatively by liberalism, which I think is even more potent at this juncture.  Here in the US, there is a feeling of complete polarization.  It is becoming impossible to be "middle of the road".  And from what we see in the UK elections, it seems that people are tired of liberalism\'s vague "hopes" for freedom and equality.  That people can say extreme ideas and those ideas can begin to be taken seriously.  Unfortunately this works for both sides, as we see fascist language becoming more commonplace.  But inevitably, I see this as a result of capitalism, not as a reaction to the left.  In fact, because the left here in the US is so weak (mainly because they have been trying to "compromise" with capital), they have no power to struggle against the far right.  I would argue that this is a time to recapture our language and our ideas.  We are not fighting for the autonomy of Silicon Valley or the global development ideas of the World Bank.  We are fighting for a new vision of the world, and I don\'t see how that vision of the world is compatible with capitalism.  If we believe that, then we must openly admit that we are calling for a revolutionary way of living.  And to push our vision forward, we must re-appropriate the words.  So maybe using strong language will push some people away.  But as has been shown in struggles around the world, it has the power to attract even more.  Its a gamble, but so is wanting a different way of life.</p>', u'post_id': 6478, u'date': u'2017-07-11 22:09:52'}, {u'user_id': 8, u'title': u'Communism has a painful ring to it', u'comment_id': 14634, u'content': u'<p>Hi guys, tuning in quickly from the road.

That would probably be about 25-30 mp3 players with small memory cards (128 MB will suffice for up to 8 hours of spoken word audio). The players will run 3-4 hours when new and charged fully (usually have a tiny 70mAh x 3.7V LiPo battery). That will be more than enough for 1-2 lectures + some music for an entertaining and relaxing break.</p>\n\n<p>Each of the players will be used by a group of 2 students (usually girls, but if somehow possible I would love to include some boys into this as well e.g. some that have younger sisters to look after).</p>\n\n<p>One can complement this "intimate lecture" by 1. a short intro for everyone via loudspeaker (also allows for questions to be answered for everyone). 2. A discussion period where the 2 students can ask each other questions and discuss things they did not understand. Then some can be interviewed e.g. in groups of 4 with 1 interviewer recording the discussion in order to have feedback for continuous improvement (I\'d recommend doing 3 of these 4+1 format interviews: 1 with the smartest, 1 with the kids that likely had the most difficulty (and would likely be disruptive in a larger group), and 1 with random pairs). These interviews are not to grade the students but to find where most misunderstandings remain, and where the lecture needs to be improved or go deeper.</p>\n\n<p>The other students can have a more regular question &amp; answer lecture. If you visit a group of approximately 50 students, you\'d ideally have 2-4 people to run the hole thing. 1 to do the recorded 4+1 interviews one after the other, and 1 to deliver the interactive lecture.</p>\n\n<p>After the lecture you carefully check if you get all materials (including memory cards) back. Then they need to be charged for about 1 hour each using 5V and a mini-usb cable. One could also do a multi day event if there are enough power supplies there. The power supplies are probably among the most expensive things. ASIN: B00MLTTO6Y will do 4 x 5V USB for 6 EUR as step down from e.g. small a car battery, ASIN: B00K67X8PQ does 1 x 5V step up from e.g. 1-2 AA batteries for approx 1.50 EUR.

On Jamendo.com we could get free music without any legal trouble. Because the mp3 players are relatively simple (you can only go forward or backward by one complete track) one could put the lecture before the music in the same track. So they would have to listen to the lecture before they get to the music. This will be some extra work in the beginning but I think you made a good point. It is possible to do ALL KINDS of sound editing in a program called audacity (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/</a>) but I think it would be good to find something more simple.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing one could offer are more or less educational stories - e.g. for language courses (e.g. from Librivox.com).

The original idea behind this is to reach really rural and remote people and provide them with good access to useful information. But to start this I was thinking about which lectures make most sense - and I think you have a very good example of one (I also agree with <span class="mention">@saeed.qaisrani</span> ). So I think the wider topic of hygiene &amp; health would be most helpful.</p>\n\n<p>I have already made a small collection of mp3 players, ear plugs for listening, some spare parts, and solar for charging the batteries. I have started to test them for reliability and easiness to repair and I am hopeful that most will survive many months before they have to be repaired. I think the cost of the audio lecture was 0.001-0.0005 EUR per minute (+ the cost of recording the lecture). The mp3 players cost about 3 EUR but the memory card also cost 1 EUR for 1 GB of storage (which is plenty). Sooo:</p>\n\n<p>1 Player needs to run for 4000 to 8000 minutes (66.7 hours). A fresh player will have to charge about 15-20 times for that. So that means they have to survive about 3 weeks of one use per day on average. If they survive longer or get repaired cheaply (very possible) then it gets significantly cheaper.</p>\n\n<p>If you know what illustrations are needed those could be printed on a robust support (e.g. playing cards or similar). Some of them could also be designed to be copied by hand (e.g. as a memory exercise).</p>\n\n<p>A couple of advantages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>you know what gets taught</p></li>\n<li><p>kids could be working at the same time, or be at home</p></li>\n<li><p>less humans in the loop (has some disadvantages, but is perhaps helpful against corruption)</p></li>\n<li><p>no literacy required</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let me know if you are interested.

(PS I've cleaned up\xa0the Open science and technologies channel a bit by untagging the projects that have no connection at all). Writing thoughts down for future reference as I rework the original text here with more concrete info, I admit they are\xa0kind of vague still.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>There is a distinction between <em>generating knowledge</em> and <em>creating prototypes/implementing solutions</em>. The former can be classified as science, the latter could be called hacking. Both are interesting, but I reckon it's more interesting to focus more deeply on one for the OpenVillage track. I want to zoom in on science.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Generating knowledge has a more long term character than prototypes and a specific profile in terms of resources &amp; technical complexity. An\xa0outcome is that results are\xa0uncertain, invisible or too far in the future to provide much incentive for a community to initiate research. This shows the role of government as an intermediary enabler of\xa0research for communities who would otherwise not make those high risk high reward choices on their own. This means we have to talk about policy.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>It is tempting to commodify the generated knowledge as an attempt to hedge risks and move incentives to the short term. Result: patents, closed access, secrecy. This is where generated knowledge stops being property of the communities it is meant for. Therefore talking about IP (or better: intellectual rights) is central to this\xa0conversation of citizen science/open science/science as a community service, in my opinion. The boundaries of these terms gets blurry to the extent that it becomes obvious that we should really just talk about a better 'science', no adjectives, as a goal.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Other aspects to be covered that are more obvious: legal &amp; admin, financial sustainability, implementation lessons, people &amp; community roles.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Curious to hear people's thoughts!</p>", u'post_id': 6211, u'date': u'2017-04-27 14:49:24'}, {u'user_id': 3362, u'title': u'Helpful', u'comment_id': 22026, u'content': u'<p>This was helpful, thanks <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 6211, u'date': u'2017-04-27 13:40:23'}, {u'user_id': 8, u'title': u'How about framing the session proposal as a challenge?', u'comment_id': 19915, u'content': u'<p>Hey\xa0You <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>How do you feel about shaping your theme as a specific call for input and participation directed towards peers, e.g. people running the projects you mention above?\xa0</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>The first thing is to have the "big" question: </strong>Which financially sustainable models are different open source and citizen science initiatives using to run shared community spaces and labs?\xa0</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The second thing is to have a clear goal for what you want to get out of your and others\' investment of time and effort</strong> in "your" part of the OpenVillage festival.

This Biohackathon event will focus on experimenting with the microfluidic technology called "Digital Microfluidics" in the context of automation of molecular biology and microbiological applications, diving deeper in how microfluidics, automation and software are changing the way biology is performed and how researchers and and extended audience can benefit from these systems.</p>\n\n<p>A number of tracks have been proposed such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tsensors</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tbiosensors (isothermal amplification and PCR, staining )</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tcell free system (GFP)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>machine vision</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Focus will be on how bio-molecular assays can be performed in a micofluidic droplet-based environment and how visual programming and software is used to control such experiments. Thanks to the contribution of CellFree Technologies we will be able to run cell free experiments in microliter droplets. Another side track is looking into how "biosensors" like PCR and LAMP would fit into the system and how to visualize the signal of the reaction itself.</p>\n\n<p>Machine vision and sensors are both tracks that that focus on how software and sensors, once integrated in such microfludiics systems, can be of use to control or observe particular phenomenons (i.e color change, fluorescence)</p>\n\n<p>Digi.Bio will provide a number of devices based on digital microfluidics technology that the participants will be able to use to automate the choosen track or a project the participant will propose autonomously. Waag Society is providing support and hosting the event in the beautiful Waag building.

I particularly like your categorisation of enabling factors. I hadn\'t come across Denis Postle\'s work before but looks like there are some good leads to follow up there. It resonates with Ivan Illich\'s critique in Tools for Conviviality - dominance of technocratic elites and radical monopolies in the field of \'mutual caring, rapport and cooperation\' to use a phrase from the psyCommons backstory. I particularly love Illich\'s description of the kitchen table in his interviews with Caley as being a place of recovering what our modern universities have lost in the "search for truth". "Friendship is required first, the search for truth\xa0is based on the creation of the \'we\'."</p>\n\n<p>My questions on policy are not intended to\xa0dismiss\xa0the efforts of policymakers. My interest is more in how we\xa0gain\xa0a better understanding of the limits of policy as a tool or instrument to ensure wiser use of\xa0range of tools and practices which will achieve the desired outcomes of policy. In writing this response I\'m reminded of two things. One something Michael Spence (of Schumacher College) wrote in <em>After Capitalism</em> about what happens to laws when they become written - which I must dig out and re-read as I think this might connect to a particular limit of policy. The other Margaret Wheatley\'s book <em>A Simpler Way,</em>\xa0which as you may know, unpacks the\xa0obsession of the so-called civilized world,\xa0dating back to Victorian times with the world descending into chaos without man imposing order - while\xa0new science is revealing that order is a natural tendency and that we need to get better at how we\xa0work with that so as not to disrupt it. So I guess another way of coming at the question could be:\xa0what do policies look like that support natural responses to care and welfare rather than prescribe interventions and methods? Policies that are more generative in relation to those enabling factors you\'ve outlined. And beyond this... perhaps something fundamental about how we reconfigure the role of the State from a living systems perspective.</p>\n\n<p>thanks again</p>', u'post_id': 6304, u'date': u'2017-06-18 10:06:00'}, {u'user_id': 200, u'title': u'Enabling factors and policy', u'comment_id': 30472, u'content': u'<p>Thanks, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/gehan">@gehan</a>. I value the focus on what is actually found to work in practice for real people. And it\'s often hard to isolate what, in general, are enabling factors, and what is just accident, that makes little difference. Then there\'s the added complication that people sometimes differ greatly in how they work. We can see this in education as well as work. What works to motivate one person might turn another one off.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ll rephrase what I was trying to say earlier, in the hope it might help. I do think that we can consider a few different kinds of enabling factors for #opencare.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The skills, attitudes, competences, knowledge, experience, etc. of individuals involved.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The designed environment, in the sense of the Peckham Experiment etc., but also including public spaces, communal spaces, sizes and geometry of living spaces (indoors and outdoors) and how their relative location</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The culture of care -- related to what Denis Postle calls the "psycommons"</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The designed opportunities for interaction, engagement, collaboration -- like your populated \'spaces round a kitchen table\'.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>"Policy" -- what a hard word indeed. I think we would all agree that a policy statement can be no more than an empty promise; and that misguided policy can be worse than no policy. I can well believe that the policies for regeneration or addiction you refer to could have been misguided.</p>\n\n<p>But I wouldn\'t want to dismiss the efforts of policymakers altogether. Maybe policy can act as a reminder to concrete effective actions? A point for coordination? Or are you trying to say that there is something inherently wrong with policymaking at present? Maybe it\'s too much (a) embroiled in politics and (b) too "top-down". Maybe we could have a policy that states that all policies are to be developed from the bottom up? Or that certain areas should be kept deliberately free of policy?</p>\n\n<p>If you really think that policymaking is essentially flawed, then maybe you\'re thinking that our current mechanisms of government are fundamentally flawed, and I wouldn\'t disagree. Similar flaws appear at national and European levels. What we do about that is another matter.

We\'ve been calling it\xa0frameworks of social solidarity.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>This led me to propose this\xa0theme with a hope\xa0of\xa0connecting up with others who share some curiousity about this and related topics. I\'m also particularly struck by the amount of energy that goes in to forming or influencing policy. This seems to be an instrument of an old world view that imagined human progress would lead us to predicting everything. What would be a) a more productive use of people\'s time and b) contribute to improved outcomes in relation to the often laudable intentions behind these policies? In Scotland, I see this happening on a national level - recently there was an academic paper published on the <a href="http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2016/11/23/groundhog-day-explaining-50-years-of-failed-renewal/">failed regeneration policies</a> pursed over the last 30-40 years, costing millions of public money that have left the deprived areas that were targeted still at the bottom of the league table. But also in our own organisation, policy responses to issues such as addiction seem a little useless. What do other responses look like? Citizen led responses that include a rich mix of\xa0culture, values, new skills, awarenesses and practices. How do we work with this more skillfully?</p>\n\n<p>Appreciate your thoughts and experiences.

What I\'m meaning by \'conditions\' is more the environment, the enabling factors - rather than \'contractual conditions\'. For me it connects to new understandings about the kind of leadership called for by emergent and uncertain times - leaders as architects, creating the containers for things to happen, self organise in a desirable way - rather than the old command and control models. I particularly love <a href="http://margaretwheatley.com/">Margaret Wheatley</a>\'s early work on this area.</p>\n\n<p>What might these look like in practice? I think it will be a combination of the factors you go on to mention; culture, values, new skills, awarenesses\xa0and practices. That is what I\'m keen to explore as part of this theme of open care. There seems to be (particularly in this area of the public sector) an over-emphasis on interventions and policies that are quite entrenched in\xa0a command-and-control mindset. What is called for to engable\xa0self-organising, citizen-led responses to welfare needs of our fellow citizens?

It can even be someone that never covers for you, as long as she covers for other people in the space (however you define its borders). So it is <em>network</em>\xa0reciprocity.\xa0But if you get the idea that someone is a free\xa0rider, then covering for her is not so OK anymore. It can only be OK if you really live in abundance, and it does not matter. But most of us are a long way from there.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Community care takes away the externality of health care ("the person that demands the care is not the person who is footing the bill", as <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/lakomaa">@Lakomaa</a> likes to say). Tradeoffs become very explicit. The best example I have seen of this is the discussion of health care in Amish communities in the US. Amish refuse insurance ("it de-responsabilises people"). So, when a person gets sick, the church collects alms to help her front expenses.\xa0<em>But</em>\xa0this might happen\xa0at a time when the community might be facing other expenses\xa0("setting up a farm for a young couple"). The community needs to decide what to do. The bottom line is: Amish people focus on\xa0<em>preventative</em><span>\xa0health care, because it\'s irt cheap and effective, and if they fall sick they are imposing a burden (however welcome) on their brothers and sisters. In other words, though the individuals are generous, the community does the economically efficient thing!

But practically speaking, how do we create the conditions where there is a positive cycle of care: where one person\'s care of another results in the second person being able to care more, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>I\'m glad you named the purpose "to bring about greater love". That comes across to me as having a deep and strong foundation.</p>\n\n<p>On a practical, psychological level, my own experience is that if I care for people who don\'t share my values to some extent, it can be dispiriting. Like giving to people who believe only in taking, and not giving back, can be very taxing. So one thing, which is no different from what you have said, in different ways perhaps, is to bring people together in a community where people share the values of caring for others, giving back, giving forward, or something similar. People who want greater love in the world, and not just for themselves!</p>\n\n<p>I believe there are many skills, relevant to this, that can be learned. Or if not learned, then maybe picked up from living in a culture where they are norms, through a process you could call "enculturation".

I love what it says about Ubuntu philosophy; "I am because we are, and since we are, therefore I am." Growing the sense of \'we\' is so fundamental to every other generative and evolutionary human project - at least to my understanding so far. I think of it as our \'collective muscle\' - our ability to think on behalf of the whole. And this muscle\xa0has become so\xa0emaciated by the experiences of modernity. Its not simply about \'being together\' or connecting - virtually or physically. It has a markedly different quality. The Misak indigenous peoples of Columbia seem to take this to a whole other level. When we co-hosted a workshop with one of their elders\xa0late last year, I was really drawn in by their descriptions of the collective consciousness and how this only came about and was sustained by active engagement in Minga (collective work). You\'ll get a sense of the clarity of their thinking here:\xa0<a href="http://www.lifemosaic.net/eng/tol/life-plan/">http://www.lifemosaic.net/eng/tol/life-plan/</a> though\xa0I don\'t think they mention Minga in this video.</p>\n\n<p>I don\'t get so much time to read so am a bit ignorant of\xa0Descartes thinking but\xa0am very familiar with its consequences for humanity and guess I have read enough on that!\xa0The problems of the modern mind... one of the things I most enjoyed learning in the last three years was that we have three brains - observable by a surgeon - discovered about 100 years ago - but forgotten because we are blind to facts that don\'t support dominant world views - in this case the myth of hierarchy (there can only be one brain)!

We started looking into care beccause, frankly, it keeps getting in the way. We\xa0are always trying to build something (an online community, a consulting business, a space for life and work... ). Building is hard, and normally underpaid because no one wants to pay for the costs of coordination and the risk-taking phase when you are building, but the thing you are building is not yielding its expected benefit because it\'s not finished. So people keep burning out, or having to take long breaks, or otherwise dropping the ball. That affects everyone else, is unfair on the tougher people who keep grinding it with less support, and fragilises everything we do.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>This is ust my own personal \xa0take, mind you. But me, I am too much of an economist not to see the efficiency gains of involving everyone, being super-flexible as to the form in which different people contribute. The Reef has a calming, burnout-preventing\xa0effect on us simply because being in one live-work place allows us to support each other in more ways. If I am exhausted, or pissed off, I can share whatever I do to flush the ad stuff out of my system: if I feel like cooking a meal I can offer you to cook for you too (or help me, if you feel like cooking too). If I feel lik going for \xa0run or a long walk I can invite you. It costs exactly nothing. But occasionally it will be just what you need: taking a break, regenerating a bit. We have already noticed how we are working fewer hours, and cutting out exactly the worktime where we are most stressed or tired \u2013 the worktime that does not produce anything. Compare the economics of this with those of bringing in a top-heavy professional system of counseling and treatment.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I have not read Illich, but yes, "conviviality" does emerge.

I agree that publicly-funded activity is limited in a number of ways and we\u2019ve been similarly burned in partnerships in the past. Our organisation has survived a number of cuts and financial challenges and nearly didn\u2019t make it after our EU employability funding came to an end after 7 years in 2012 (though I personally find the employability agenda deeply problematic).

MakEY (the project we\'re a partner in) is 100% focused on early years kids, devising workshops to help teachers gain confidence and skills to lead higher value making sessions for 5-8 year-olds, hopefully enthusing them with STEM. We\'re looking to have fun with robots, drawing, moulding things, playing with conductive materials and electricity; then we aim to develop best practices which we can disseminate to other school environments. A further objective may be to understand what kind of "makerspace" could be accommodated inside a school. As you\'ll no doubt be aware, there\'s an EU-wide problem with retaining young people in STEM learning, and this will put us in a poor position to compete globally, and make best use of the new transformations in manufacture.</p>\n\n<p>From our point-of-view at "Makers", our interest in making extends into the enterprises that making enables. We welcome the strategic engagement with making that MakEY suggests - but we also question whether the new, high-tech jobs that relocalised manufacture suggest are really real, or another digital illusion. If relocalised manufacture means nothing more than an "automated manufacture pod" attached to each supermarket, that robotically creates objects on demand from a centralised database, then, frankly, it is of little interest. While it may have some environmental advantages, it will only serve further to centralise wealth and employment. Only if relocalised manufacture reinvigorates locally-owned enterprises, bringing high skill, high quality jobs into neighbourhoods, will it have a positive economic effect, and only if it can help to relocalise the act of invention itself will it be a positive force on a cultural level.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, of course, I have studiously avoided the implications of the B-word.

You mentioned that I\'m now doing "something else" after I left Access Space. Indeed! In a sense I am doing a very similar thing - but with a different business model and emphasis.</p>\n\n<p>I left Access Space just after we\'d delivered an incredibly successful EU funded project: Sheffield Community Network. The project\'s overarching objective was to create jobs and social enterprises in the Sheffield City Region, and my particular role was to investigate the local employment potential of digital making technologies, give support to local enterprises that were investing in these processes, and help understand what positive local impacts could come out of engagement with 3D Print, Lasercutting, CNC, Digital Embriodery and so on.</p>\n\n<p>We (Access Space) were a minor partner, receiving less than 5% of the project budget - yet one of our clients, who we helped to prototype a key product, has created more jobs than the WHOLE PROGRAMME\'S OBJECTIVE. How were we thanked for this? We had our budget cut.</p>\n\n<p>That led me to feel that there is no future in publicly-funded programmes, particularly when they involve asymmetric power relationships - a local authority, for example, can simply dictate to minor partners how a budget will be deployed. This is partnership in name only,</p>\n\n<p>So, I and my wife Lisa started "Makers" - a high-street shop which combines digital making and traditional craft activities with upcycling and re-use. Our objective is to take the lessons I learned from my research at Access Space, and deploy it in a context that\'s completely self-sustaining. Our logic is that, in these increasingly reactionary times, public money will not be available to help localities, so we\'ll need to make sure that what we do works on a completely commercial basis. This means that job number one is to SELL! Every other objective can only be realised after we understand exactly how to relocalise manufacture SUSTAINABLY.</p>\n\n<p>If we can find this path, then the potential for replication is obvious. If not, I fear that the new "maker economy" will be so much hot air, and digital making will suck resources out of localities and neighbourhoods, just as have so many other waves of supposedly "decentralising" technologies.</p>\n\n<p>"Makers" has a website here: <a href="http://makersontheedge.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://makersontheedge.com</a>. We sell things that we and local people have made, plus interesting old, curious and unique things that we acquire. What we don\'t sell is mass manufactured stuff.

The reason for me personally is obvious: being a community manager here at edgeryders, the core of my work goes into creating the conditions for care, in a community and organisation: whether it\'s trying to forge new relationships and learning, creating\xa0meaningful work for those of us not willing to\xa0compromise\xa0to an exploitative\xa0job market but needing to find resilience in precarity, or just being on the margins somehow socioeconomically but also health wise, or culturally.\xa0I realise more and more how ambitious this is and how we need to be in it for decades to understand how it can shift things broadly, culturally or in policy, like you say - doing things differently, rewiring ourselves etc.</p>\n\n<p>Some projects and wonderful people I know which you might want to consider connecting with, mainly because they\xa0go deep into rewiring communities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/woodbine-health-autonomy-center/488">Woodbine Health Autonomy Center</a> in nyc (meet <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/woodbinehealth">@Woodbinehealth</a> !) collective and info/educational\xa0center asserting the need to\xa0regain\xa0control over our health, move away\xa0from institutionalized healthcare which addresses only localised, symptomatic problems in the paradigm of the\xa0individualist modern society.

Again, what stayed with me over the years is this very uncompromising view:\xa0<em>"We realise now that the most valuable technology that is being discarded by our society is PEOPLE.

Great first stab, congratulations!</p>\n\n<p>I would start from the info you you want to convey, and convey by data visualisation rather than text whenever possible. Maybe the number of deaths is also better represented by a number or a time series rather than a block of text.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I would spend some time visualising the data. Histograms? Dashboard-style numbers? Time series? \xa0If your story is "rising social costs", time series make most sense. You could even combine basic information: put in the same graph the rising number of diabetics D, the rising price of insulin P, and the total cost of providing insulin D x B x Q, where Q (constant ) is the number of insulin doses a patient consumes in a year. The product of two rising values rises very fast!</p>\n\n<p>If this is your story, a missing information is how much open sourced processes could bring down the price.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Again, you could experiment with dataviz to convey the message. For example, you could project your cost of insulin into the future , with and without open sourced processes.</p>\n\n<p>Only then you would write a text that contains the info that you cannot convey by dataviz. My hunch is that now you have too much text for an infographics, but I am no expert.

Feel free to comment, I would like to start designing this Wednesday, Thursday.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Title: So what do you know about "The Sugar" ?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Intro: The number of people wih diabetes has doubled in the last decennia.\xa0Everybody knows someone that is suffering from\xa0diabetis but do you know what is really happening inside the body of someone with diabetes? Do you know what to do when someone gets a hypo?\xa0In this infographic you will find some basic info about diabetes and how you can prevent it.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>1) What is diabetes?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Diabetes is a chronic condition that increases blood sugar levels. This can have two causes: either the insulin is insufficient or the insulin produced is insufficiently effective. In both cases, the cells can not absorb enough sugar (glucose), which accumulates in the blood. There are two types of diabetis:</p>\n\n<p>Type 1: Occurs\xa0usually in children or adolescents and affects less than 10% of all people with diabetes.\xa0Body does not produce enough insulin.</p>\n\n<p>Type 2: Over 90% of people with diabetes have diabetes type 2. This occurs especially from the age of 40 years.\xa0Body produces insulin but can\u2019t use it well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2) How many people have diabetes?\xa0</strong></p>\n\n<p>The number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014.\xa0In 2012, an estimated 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes and another 2.2 million deaths were attributable to high blood glucose. WHO projects that diabetes will be the 7th leading cause of death in 2030.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3) What are the complications? How can you prevent them?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Diabetes can lead to complications in many parts of the body and increase the risk of dying prematurely.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Intestines &amp; stomach problems, heart attack, kiney failure, blindness, hearing loss, stroke, damage of nerves and blood vessels, amputation of feet or leg, fatigue,..</p>\n\n<p>Eat and drink healthy, quit smoking, keep your weight under control, exercise, keep the sugar levels in your blood under control, check your feet, get a check-up on a regular basis, keep learning about diabetes!</p>\n\n<p><strong>4) What is\xa0gestational diabetes?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A special form of diabetes is gestational diabetes. This occurs especially in the second half of pregnancy. This calls for further follow-up to minimize risks during pregnancy and at birth. Usually the diabetes disappears after childbirth. The diagnosis of gestational diabetes is an alarm signal. It means that you have a high risk of developing persistent diabetes in the first 5 to 10 years. Pregnancy diabetes occurs in 5 to 20% of pregnancies, usually in the second half of pregnancy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5) What do you need to do when someone has an attack?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If your blood sugar levels fall below 4 mmol / l, you have a hypo. That\'s what you notice:\xa0</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\xa0\xa0 \xa0to sweat</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 vibrate</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\xa0\xa0 \xa0being dizzy</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 suddenly changing mood (suddenly angry, for example) is unconcentrated</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\xa0\xa0 \xa0headache</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\xa0\xa0 \xa0being tired</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\xa0\xa0 \xa0be hungry</p>\n\n<p>A hypo is about eating or drinking something quickly (not light). For example, six to eight tablets of grape sugar.</p>\n\n<p>If your blood sugar exceeds 10 mmol / l, you have hyper. That\'s what you notice:</p>\n\n<p><span>\u2022\xa0Pee a lot</span></p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Have a lot of thirst and keep it</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 are tired</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 sudden moodiness, getting angry quickly</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 be sick or give up</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Everything feels annoying</p>\n\n<p><span>The body itself wants to lose too much sugar in the blood, through lots of pee. Many people continue to drink (but nothing sweet!) Helps. Also movement is good, then the blood sugar burns. If you are using insulin, you usually need to inject additional insulin.</span></p>\n\n<p>Sources</p>\n\n<p>About OPEN INSULIN</p>\n\n<p><span></span></p>\n\n<p></p>', u'post_id': 6277, u'date': u'2017-05-15 09:37:31'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Whoa', u'comment_id': 17808, u'content': u'<p>That post is heartbreaking, Winnie.

Is usually delegated to the patients the duty of providing the accurate information about their health condition every visit.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tThe missing digitalization of the gathered health data and the consequent discontinuity of the healing process.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tThe limited precision of the anamnestic research due to the high number of patients and the short time available.</li>\n\n</ol><ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<strong>Final User, individuals and\xa0community target</strong>\n\n<p></p>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>ResQ is conceived to ease the communication among physicians (involved in critical context such as temporary hospitals and reception centers) regarding the health state of foreigner patients who don\u2019t know the language of the hosting country. In this way, the tool is designed for physicians, but the main benefits will come for migrating patients whose this services is dedicated to.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<strong>Solution, brief description of the project</strong>\n\n<p></p>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>ResQ is a mobile management tool that improves the communication among healthcare workers (especially physicians, but also volunteers, nurses etc etc...), getting as a result the reduction of the language barrier that very often doesn\u2019t allow foreign patient to fully explain their symptoms or their own pathologies.</p>\n\n<p>The personal pathological condition besides being a psychological kind of weight, for instance when a patient has to explain multiple times his/her condition to a series of different medical specialists, it could also lead to misinterpretation and diagnosis issues when there might be a language barrier.</p>\n\n<p>ResQ is conceived to to be used mainly during the period in which the migrant still doesn\u2019t own a \u201cCodice Fiscale\u201d (personal unique fiscal code), but only a STP card (Straniero Temporaneamente Presente), that makes her/ him able to benefit from the main national healthcare services (for 12 months maximum).</p>\n\n<p>The reception centers that provide the STP card and give the first medical assistance, have to deal with a very high number of people in a stressful situation that often lead to a superficial treatment.</p>\n\n<p>In this way we designed an agile gathering data tool that saves time and in few minutes would be able to fulfill a complete health history of the patients. Also, the digitalization of such a document would make possible an extensive sharing with colleagues that later will take care of the same patient.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore the physician will have the chance to communicate autonomously among themselves without misunderstanding through the management tool.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<strong>Technologies we will adopt</strong>\n\n<p></p>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The tool we are designing will be developed in order to be accessible from the main devices available on the market.

On their arrival in Sicily, they are being examined by the first aid team; the process usually consists in fever/temperature measurement, the mandatory tuberculosis test and the regular doctor checkup.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the checkups that are being performed on the first emergency (arrival to Italy)?</strong></p>\n\n<p>First Aid, for example treating wounds caused by the conditions of travel, fever and if serious problems are presented it is inserted in the migrant\u2019s info sheet and the record.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are the doctors in charge of the first visit always the same or they change?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The doctors are not being chosen by the reception center staff but they are so called STP doctors. This means that they are treating patients that are not covered by health insurance or they are general doctors with an independent office and not employees of the hospital. In Marta\u2019s experience they are usually not very thorough with the patients case and in fact once migrants are provided with health insurance they are not advised to consult STP doctors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>On what criteria are doctors chosen?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Marta was not able to provide this information, contact directly a doctor to clarify this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are the collected data being managed?</strong></p>\n\n<p>First step is filling in the form with all the personal data, history of previous diseases and therapies, also if if there were wounds or fever caused by the travel it is being noted. Often happens that this first form is not filled in because the first checkup is performed in a hurry and superficially. Afterwards, once the migrants are transferred to reception centers the staff receives the copy of this form and they add more info and more detailed and elaborated record on the migrant that is being sent to the municipality officials. This form is scanned and sent by email. The lack of a database is targeted as a problem as well as the management of hard copy records and documents.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the major problems during the doctors\u2019 visits?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A logistical problem is that there is no any information prior to the arrival of the migrants to the reception center in order to prepare better. They come by a bus and the staff is not informed neither on their medical state nor the nationality, sex and age in order to preogranize the visits and accommodation.</p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/alessandro_contini">@alessandro_contini</a> <span class="mention">@silviad.ambrosio</span> <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/chiarafrr">@ChiaraFrr</a></p>', u'post_id': 33729, u'date': u'2017-06-07 14:31:52'}, {u'user_id': 3143, u'title': u'Sounds great to me!', u'comment_id': 33800, u'content': u'<p>I think it would be great to involve your friend from day one!</p>\n\n<p>s/he would probably have a lot of precious insights that would be highly needed to implement the best user experience for such a scenario.</p>\n\n<p>did you maybe elaborated the\xa0concept a little further?</p>\n\n<p>I would suggest to have a look at these</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<a href="http://urban-refugees.org/for-immediate-release-urban-refugees-to-develop-a-mobile-messaging-system-to-help-refugee-community-overcome-communication-challenges/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://urban-refugees.org/for-immediate-release-urban-refugees-to-develop-a-mobile-messaging-system-to-help-refugee-community-overcome-communication-challenges/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://urban-refugees.org/for-immediate-release-urban-refugees-to-develop-a-mobile-messaging-system-to-help-refugee-community-overcome-communication-challenges/</a>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<a href="https://www.gsma.com/refugee-connectivity/apps-for-refugees/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="https://www.gsma.com/refugee-connectivity/apps-for-refugees/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.gsma.com/refugee-connectivity/apps-for-refugees/</a>\n</li>\n\n</ul>', u'post_id': 33729, u'date': u'2017-05-29 10:06:00'}, {u'user_id': 3596, u'title': u'Proposal', u'comment_id': 33789, u'content': u'<p>Hello Alessandro,</p>\n\n<p>thank you for your availability and for creating this possibility.</p>\n\n<p>I find that implementing our app and the concept in the ONG sector dedicated to emergency situations is not only interesting and suitable, but needed and helpful.

Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>(It doesn\'t have to be a detailed translation of all\xa0the content above, a couple of paragraphs highlighting the key aspects of your concept would do the job!)</p>\n\n<p>Talking about the proposal,\xa0I like the idea of helping doctors communicating \xa0more efficiently with each other in order to help patients, as a consequence,\xa0in relieving the weight of their own personal pathological condition. Besides being a psychological kind of weight, for instance when a patient has to explain multiple times his/her condition to a series of different medical specialists, it could also lead to misinterpretation and diagnosis issues when for instance there might be a language barrier.</p>\n\n<p>Now this leads to two different considerations:</p>\n\n<p>1 Based on my design experience, it is extremely hard to convince workers in the standard medical field (hospital,\xa0primary care physicians, etc...)\xa0to adopt a new kind of CRM software for multiple reasons: regulations issues due to privacy and national laws, obligations in using a specific software, affection to a well known software in contrast to the commitment in learning a new one,(even when the new one has better user experience...\xa0)\xa0</p>\n\n<p>2 Such a digital system/experience could be way more powerful when there is actually a language barrier and/or the patient itself is in a context s/he doesn\'t know very well how to swim in.</p>\n\n<p>This made me think of trying to change the context of the concept and switch to scenarios such as the activity of ONGs like Doctors Without Borders, or thinking at care issues\xa0in\xa0refugee camps on European soil\xa0at this present day.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that re-thinking the service/app in terms of the specific needs in the scenarios above could lead to\xa0interesting solutions and could work for different reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I suppose the physicians working in these scenarios would be more free to choose their own set of tools as long as they are effective in solving real problems quickly\xa0</p></li>\n<li><p>I suppose they would generally\xa0meet patients very quickly, maybe one time only, and then address them to other physicians</p></li>\n<li><p>It would solve the language barrier issue of the patient since the two physicians are communicating "in the background"</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course all of these hypotheses would need validation through research in the field.</p>\n\n<p>Do you think this approach could be of your interest and would you like to give it a try?</p>\n\n<p>Happy to hear your thoughts about it <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 33729, u'date': u'2017-05-17 16:17:42'}, {u'user_id': 3585, u'title': u'Undisclosed content ', u'comment_id': 11649, u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 6373, u'date': u'2017-06-13 21:06:49'}, {u'user_id': 3362, u'title': u'Notes June 7th', u'comment_id': 7979, u'content': u'<p><b>Meeting 07.06.2017 at\xa0Timelab, Ghent</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Present: <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/flinty">@flinty</a> | <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/bramdejaegher">@BramDeJaegher</a> | <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/gls9000">@GLS9000</a> | <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/ritavht">@ritavht</a> |\xa0Wim |\xa0Simon |\xa0<a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/michielstock">@Michielstock</a> \xa0| <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/winnieponcelet">@WinniePoncelet</a> \xa0</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Notes (can also be found\xa0on the Drive <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYap2NhA4DfHK27vhIhaz8mXmm3tHnhRGyzaCnxE25o/edit">here</a>)</b></p>\n\n<p><b>-------</b></p>\n\n<p><b>\xa0</b></p>\n\n<h3><b>Lab work / arrival of samples</b></h3>\n\n<p><b>\xa0</b></p>\n\n<p>Rita posted a list of things to order on the Drive <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iSkMN5A6ekOl3yXJnnTu2CtJFcAcX6C3cjrDeiYyqJo/edit#gid=768830527">here</a>, as the samples (spotted plasmids) are about to arrive.</p>\n\n<p>Shee and Federica also posted some useful protocols.</p>\n\n<p>Bram: what is the lifetime of the plasmids when they arrive?</p>\n\n<p>Federica: they keep a long time, but it\u2019s best to resuspend them and store in a -20\xb0C freezer. Part of them should be used to transform the bacteria and freeze those at -80\xb0C in a glycerol stock.</p>\n\n<p>Open Biolab has most things equipment/some consumables available to do the transformation, as well as storage. The option of getting an own -80\xb0C freezer (Wim knows of one) is not ideal right now - high electricity use and it\u2019s very big/heavy for just storing a few samples. It will be simpler to do it at a uni for now.</p>\n\n<p>We will need about \u20ac400 (minus materials we can find ourselves) to get started with the lab work. Rita should be able to order them and she will see which materials we already have/can get elsewhere. <b>If you have something from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iSkMN5A6ekOl3yXJnnTu2CtJFcAcX6C3cjrDeiYyqJo/edit#gid=768830527">this list</a> to contribute, get in touch with Rita.</b></p>\n\n<p>Winnie can get us underway with some of the money he got from the OpenCare Fellowship. Michiel will look into reusing leftover budget from iGem. Then the next iGem team can also use Open Insulin for their project.</p>\n\n<p>Some thoughts on BL2 lab: as Open BioLab is not always open (they close over the summer), a backup option would be handy. Michiel and Wim will ask around. From October (if all goes to plan), we could use Wim\u2019s new lab if needed. Using a lab is mainly about permission, safety and legal reasons are no obstacle (see OBL).</p>\n\n<h3><b>Road map / science</b></h3>\n\n<p>Federica and Bram will put their heads together to come up with a road map for the science and lab work. Concrete milestones would make the plan better. A first step is already clear: replicating the Oakland work with the plasmids we receive. Although our work can be more useful on downstream processing, this way we gain experience, prove reproducibility and have a reference point for when we change the construct. After that, the roadmap and milestone should offer us some focus, as there are many options to test (different organisms, different linkers, microfluidics optimization, \u2026)</p>\n\n<p>There are already plenty of papers on the Google Drive, thanks to the work of the teams in Oakland and Sydney.</p>\n\n<p><b>\xa0</b></p>\n\n<h3><b>Microfluidics</b></h3>\n\n<p>On testing multiple conditions: Wim mentioned the work of Peter Schotte with 3D printed caps for shaking flasks that are a simple, cheap way for changes in conditions. Bram: if we get the microfluidics device working, they could also be used for this.</p>\n\n<p><b>\xa0</b>Bram did research on the OpenDrop device, to figure out how to get started and the feasibility. His impression was that it\u2019s not so well documented in order to build one ourselves. We can however buy a finished device for \u20ac500.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tThe components cost about \u20ac90 (chinese, not considering import tax)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tTheyy have to be soldered, it\u2019s a complex chip. A service could do it, but that would be minimum \u20ac200 (transport and logistics will also make this more expensive and cumbersome)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tIn total it would be minimum \u20ac350, but there are plenty of uncertainties and risks</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>\xa0</b></p>\n\n<p>In order to continue, we really need to find people with more knowledge, have a better view of the possibilities. We can use the hackathon in Amsterdam for this. There will be many experts present, as well as the chips of Digi.bio. We can try to do some of the experiments we will do with the plasmids, on the chips. Designing or working on the chip itself however, is not the goal or something we have the right skills for.</p>\n\n<p><b>\xa0</b></p>\n\n<p>Who wants to join us for the biohackathon?

We tend to associate a negative connotation with grief - that the griever "has not moved on", is "affecting others", is "bothersome" - that moralizes the different beliefs and practices people have about the dead. In some cultures, the dead are permanently embedded into the daily lives of the living, such as when Taoists pray to their ancestors via altars, or when the Japanese pay respects to their dead in mediated ways through digital budisan on apps and websites. For some cultures/some of us, these everyday integrations bring comfort and recovery more than any prescribed grieving period will, and digital media are certainly helping to normalize these options.</p>', u'post_id': 548, u'date': u'2016-10-17 04:46:03'}, {u'user_id': 104, u'title': u'great post', u'comment_id': 24145, u'content': u'<p><a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/wishcrys"></a><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/wishcrys">@wishcrys</a> </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for this. I suffered a loss many years ago and couldn\'t understand the reaction of the people around me. It was if they allowed me a month or two to "get over it" and then I was expected to move on. Some good friends couldn\'t bring themselves to mention the dead person\'s name or admit she ever existed - as if it would be too painful. Yet I wanted to talk, and talk about her. But I got the message and shut up too, to everyone\'s relief it seemed. I remember crying in front of my brother a few months later and he didn\'t know how to cope. But he hadn\'t been taught that expressing emotions is normal and human. I would be delighted if the coming of the digital age can have a positive impact in tis respect, enabling people to express their grief, and their concern for the grieving, more boldly and freely.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 548, u'date': u'2016-10-13 22:23:27'}, {u'user_id': 3397, u'title': u'Hi @Alberto,\n\nI responsed\xa0to some of these in my ', u'comment_id': 22330, u'content': u'<p>Hi <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/alberto">@Alberto</a>,</p>\n\n<p>I responsed\xa0to some of these in my reply to Patrick below. I think the key distinction between the infamous Black Mirror episode and other forms of memorialization is the conflation of <em>representation</em>\xa0of a person with the\xa0<em>actual</em>\xa0person. When we mourn through artifacts and practices, we remember selective attributes of the dead and memoralize the things significant to us. But we seek not to replicate, copy, reduplicate these sensations and connections. They are\xa0<em>nostalgia</em>\xa0rather than\xa0<em>replication</em>, which is probably why concept behind the BM episode was so arresting - it sought to\xa0<em>replace</em>\xa0the dead rather than\xa0<em>remember\xa0</em>him.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 548, u'date': u'2017-06-05 10:22:49'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'I had no idea', u'comment_id': 20691, u'content': u'<p>Wow, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/wishcrys">@wishcrys</a> . This is a beautiful, well researched post.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I am definitely not young anymore, and I guess I am still moving within the paradigm of "mourn, then move on". Actually, my understanding is that you mourn exactly to\xa0make peace with your loss, so that everybody can move on. People in my circles keep memories and memento of those who passed away, but they do not want them to be too interactive.</p>\n\n<p>This is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Right_Back_(Black_Mirror)">the famous Black Mirror episode about digital afterlife</a> was so disturbing. The protagonist was flailing about, unable to move on, as the AI occasionally manages to make a convincing simulation of her dead husband. Convincing, that is, to her: we, the spectators, are not fooled. We shake\xa0our heads as she holds on to the simulacrum. We see her doing almost all the cognitive work to build the illusion of an ongoing relationship.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>This is a well known bug in our cognition: we antropomorphize.

I\'m sorry to hear about your cousin and share in your experience that these fleeting witnessing of the social media profiles of the dead are a jarring juxtaposition that solicits the grieving process all over again. Yet, many of the young people I interviewed expressed that this presence brought them comfort and helped in their recovery, because the memory of their loved one is permanently embedded into their social media networks and uses, and the digital footprints they share can be achived and memoralized on the\xa0<em>digital</em>\xa0platform of social media (they pay less attention to the\xa0<em>public\xa0</em>nature of some of these platforms).</p>\n\n<p>Memorialization of the dead for the dead who can no longer speak for themselves is indeed tricky. I think there is an implicit hierarchy of grief and proximity among the loved ones of the deceased that influencers who gets to have a say. I personally feel a little put-off when folks of super-distant, loosely aggregated, weak social ties excessively express their grief over my sister, especially when some folks start comparing the authenticity and intensity of their grief. But I remind myself that it is not in my place to police how people grief, because we all cope in ways that help us. So I end up putting aside some of these negative feelings, and reach out to those in the \'inner social circle\' for mutual aftercare.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 548, u'date': u'2016-10-17 04:36:00'}, {u'user_id': 8, u'title': u'Cousin', u'comment_id': 8509, u'content': u'<p>Hi Crystal.</p>\n\n<p>I am sorry for your loss.

Her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hiba.gailani">facebook page</a> is still up and people use it as a memorial site. Sometimes her icon pops up unexpectedly in my feeds and it floors me everytime. I couldn\'t go to the funeral: it still feels surreal, like she might show up at any time, and the "active" facebook account isn\'t helping.</p>\n\n<p>I am a private person- If and when I do post about anything it is with a lot of consideration. I rarely post about someone while they are alive if it is not to share something they themselves intended for public consumption. Posting about someone else\'s death\xa0feels like a violation of their agency and privacy. They can no longer have agency over the narrative spun about them and it somehow adds insult to the injury for me.</p>\n\n<p>When I witness others sharing their grief I usually get in touch via a PM. Asking how they are and offering a shoulder to cry on if they need it. Commenting feels to exposed, like participating in a spectacle orchestrated by FB. Did you ever watch "We Live in Public"? I did many years ago and it has definitely shaped how I feel about social media.</p>\n\n<p>Using Social Media more conscienscously....mmm I don\'t know. What immediately comes to mind is that the business models of commercial social media platforms is advertising based "fast" media. I ask myself what effect this has on the dynamics of grief, which are slow and\xa0somehow not very condusive to selling anything - except for membership in cults or possibly self-help literature.</p>\n\n<p>In my parents cultures grief is a shared experience, there are a lot of social rituals for processing it have written about it in\xa0<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/life-and-death-at-the-unmonastery/1940">Life and Death at the UnMonastery</a>. I recently came across something called <a href="https://www.sundayassembly.com/">Sunday Assembly</a>. They have set up a secular equivalent to the sunday sermons at church to address the lack of spaces for social communion and other\xa0rituals which are key to cementing strong communities. Somehow I feel social media can be used to grow these kinds of movements and to connect a critical mass of people to them. So that when grief\xa0strikes, the individual is embedded in a nurturing local community that can help them heal.</p>\n\n<p>My two cents..</p>\n\n<p>I don\'t know if it relevant to your work</p>', u'post_id': 548, u'date': u'2016-10-12 10:19:00'}, {u'user_id': 3310, u'title': u'FYI', u'comment_id': 6793, u'content': u'<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/francesco_maria_zava">@Francesco_Maria_ZAVA</a></p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/matteo">@Matteo</a></p>', u'post_id': 851, u'date': u'2017-06-05 09:08:08'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'Really makes a difference!', u'comment_id': 22743, u'content': u'<p>Wow, much more informative\xa0<a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/shakaerjola">@shakaerjola</a> and good luck with your new work at YMCA!

Are you already seeing some positive results with your project Iffat? </p>\n\n<p>I especially like the idea of talking to private companies - where I come from in Romania, I have many friends working in corporate environments who would like to volunteer more, or get their colleagues to volunteer more - and they dont have a fun way to do it, together (better than on their own..). Their thinking is: why dont we talk to management to convince them to give us 2 hours once a month to go out on a set cause. A good person to "make the case" and convince management in the company is the employee representative - who understands volunteering but also the interests of the company and knows how to frame it.</p>\n\n<p>An actual example, a few years ago our city hall gave all the green spaces in the city for "rental" to firms willing to maintain them - so the firms took their employees out for planting weekends. After that they get their name on the green space as the "Carers" of the space. </p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/2443deb3448e350269ac787f2871f29414af65f8" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2443deb3448e350269ac787f2871f29414af65f8.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Capture_2.jpg"><img src="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/2443deb3448e350269ac787f2871f29414af65f8_1_690x457.jpg" width="690" height="457"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Capture_2.jpg</span><span class="informations">1216x806 498 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>', u'post_id': 848, u'date': u'2017-05-30 13:53:33'}, {u'user_id': 3664, u'title': u"Thank u so much ! @mashrekur_rahman why don't ", u'comment_id': 17589, u'content': u'<p>Thank u so much ! <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/mashrekur_rahman">@mashrekur_rahman</a> why don\'t you take the challenge and join us too? <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 848, u'date': u'2017-05-25 17:45:10'}, {u'user_id': 3500, u'title': u'Great initiative.', u'comment_id': 15576, u'content': u"<p>Hello Iffat,</p>\n\n<p>Being a scientist and environmentalist from Bangladesh myself, I can appreciate the simplicity of your project.

In nature everything is connected and everything functions through viable, long-term, symbiotic relationships. In this new model of a new society based on solidarity, collaboration, and fairness we are trying to create and advocate, I really do not think that anything can be achieved without partnerships. Nothing in nature works alone, why should we? Hence concepts like CSA are strong representatives of this new type of communities we need to evolve into. It also stands to reason that no-one can know everything and have experience (let alone expertise) in every field; by combining forces with someone that knows how to farm we stand to gain lots more than if go at it on our own. So I would say find local farmers to source your food from and co-produce together.</p>\n\n<p>Food Sovereignty and Agroecology are political matters at heart -hence the (obvious) connection with governments and policy makers -as you correctly pointed out. What \u2018we the people\u2019 fail to recognize is that \u2018that\u2019 (governors and policy-makers) should be us! We need to play a more active role where our livelihoods and our present and future are concerned! So we need to find ways (and where there isn\u2019t one, create it) to push for changes in policy, in the way our affairs are run (and whom by). This is why pushing for the creation of Food Policy Councils is an idea I stand by, and this is why one of the main pillars of the FoodSov movement is related to this specific sector -ie political lobbying and advocacy. After all, the word \'eco\' in greek means house, the place where one lives, and we can\'t be proper (agro)ecologists without giving enough attention into how this house is run!</p>\n\n<p>But FoodSov and Agroecology are also about being practical and hands-on, hence the phrase about growing food and not writing manifestos. 70% of the world\'s food is produced -contrary to mass belief, by small farmers around the world. We are an active movement, we put food on our table every day, and that\'s no small thing. We just need to realise the importance and value of that, and unite with our natural allies -e.g. the producers and bringers of our food and health (for as a wise farmer once said \'we are not in the business of producing mere food! I like to say that what I do for a living is cultivate people\'s health\').</p>', u'post_id': 559, u'date': u'2016-12-16 06:48:00'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Where to start?', u'comment_id': 7761, u'content': u'<p>Hello, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/jenny_gkiougki">@Jenny_Gkiougki</a> , welcome to Edgeryders!\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Food sovereignty sounds like a great concept.

In Edgeryders, we do mostly small projects \u2013 not realistic to set aside huge resources for impact eval. But, if you are handling data, you are going to need resources. Reason: statistics. The simplest project eval tool is a test on the hypothesis that\xa0</p>\n\n<p>variable you are trying to affect <strong>with</strong> the project = variable you are trying to affect <strong>without</strong> the project</p>\n\n<p>If the test rejects the hypothesis, you have impact.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from the obvious problems of finding the counterfactual etc, this has a problem: you need enough\xa0datapoints to support your rejection. "Enough" gets complicated quickly:\xa0it depends on the size of the difference between the value of the variable with/without the project, on assumptions on the distributions of the error term in each realisation of the experiment etc.\xa0But basically: the more datapoints you have, the more accurate your test. You want to\xa0be able to say, for example, that the difference in the variable between with-project and without-project is significant at the 95% confidence level. But datapoints cost. It comes down to this: project eval with statistics can usually not be done for small projects.</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody have experience with qualitative eval methods, more tolerant of small sample sizes?

Studying crowdfunding and charity there are some rules that help: people like "successful" initiative (the achievement of a specific goal that adress a specific need), to produce a somehow quantifiable contribution (for this reason the pledge should be done directly by the users) and to have some choices (this reinforce engagement part).</p>\n\n<p>I think also this model would help us to involve smaller organizations that could be more willing to support the promotion activity for fairbnb.</p>\n\n<p>For the support of Fairbnb outside big cities, I think two are the consideration needed:</p>\n\n<p>The first is that Fairbnb should help valorize places that are underrated.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I\'m from Italy (from Rome) and in my opinion, there are so many little places that are worth visiting, is really upsetting knowing that just a few cities here have the attention of international travelers.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>For example, I rarely suggest to go in Rome (especially if you are young), go to Sicily if you can :)!!</p>\n\n<p>More in general the money generated through the Fairbnb system are split 60% goes around the area where you traveled (it can be the entire region) and the other 40% can be given to any project inside the platform. I think the problem could be addressed with specific calls for this projects in those places.</p>\n\n<p>I recently randomly read this book <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13086.Suburban_Nation" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13086.Suburban_Nation</a> that I suggest often and that gave me a much deeper knowledge of suburbs.</p>\n\n<p>For the countryside, I think that the tendency of the people from this places to go in the major cities could be reversed (especially in Italy) since cities don\'t represent any more a place of opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>This is a much broader argument, but I hope that the platform that we are building could help to experiment new models to solve problems related to this places.</p>', u'post_id': 829, u'date': u'2017-05-26 14:32:35'}, {u'user_id': 2569, u'title': u'Really interested in following this project.\n\nIt seems that ', u'comment_id': 24694, u'content': u"<p>Really interested in following this project.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that you've really put some thought into how this could work.</p>\n\n<p>I see a couple of parallels between the service platform and a couple of initiative that run in the UK. I wonder if there's some extrapolation that can be taken from them.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, many supermarkets in the Uk have charity partners in the local community. They hold them for 3-4 months each. Every shopper who spends over a set amount (i think it is \xa320) is given a small plastic token. They are then encouraged to drop these tokens into a box by the main doors, selecting one of the 3 charities to recieve their donation.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the period the tokens are collected and counted and all the charities recieve the amount of money that has been donated to each box from the supermarket company. Its a basic mechanism and it only raises small amounts of cash, but the charities are often very small. Also, (and i think this ties in with your idea in a comment above) the money raise goes towards the delivery of a specific project or purchase.</p>\n\n<p>It is often the case in the UK that fundraising from grant making charities is tied directly to projects. It is very hard to get funding to cover ongoing overheads, and business expenses.</p>\n\n<p>I think that this model would work best with the Fairbnb platform. People chosing to use the platform as hosts and 'customers' would be able to see the successes that funded projects provide,. I assume that a large section of the platform would be dedicated to sharing the success stories with the service users?</p>\n\n<p>I know i would look to use a service like this instead of an airbnb service if it were available.</p>\n\n<p>I guess my question would be what plans do you have for encouraging participation in the platform outside of major cities? I can foresee that these are the areas where uptake of new platforms are often slowest, but that they are often areas with high levels of charity support and high levels of poverty. I'm thinking for example of an area like Cornwall in England (high use of holiday lettings and airbnb style accommodation, but also high levels of regional un/under-employment and low levels of Government engagement in service delivery)</p>", u'post_id': 829, u'date': u'2017-05-18 13:24:02'}, {u'user_id': 3605, u'title': u'Long term support for projects', u'comment_id': 23282, u'content': u'<p>I don\'t have a fully formed idea, but I thought that projects that did well after the first crowdfunding could get back on the platform after 1 or 2 years.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the projects after funded should remain in a dedicated part of the platform to keep updated the community, and there anyone is free to donate more whenever they want.</p>\n\n<p>We need a little money to finalize the platform. Anyway, the activation process has said have many steps. The choice on how to redistribute part of the value generated by the users is made by them deciding to which project pledge their money.

It should be for activity that is not normally done by the association (this may be different in places like Syria, etc.). \xa0</p>\n\n<p>One of my goals is to allow plurality, especially for new initiative is always hard to find funding.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, this is something that needs to be discussed in depth, the nice thing about this is that it will create a perpetual passive funding that could literally enable thousands of valuable projects to reach their goals.</p>\n\n<p>So about the host you pointed out an interesting thing, the model that I described is focussed more on projects and travelers than on hosts.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking about something like having the host deciding a single project to "pledge", and it will gain 1 extra day on the crowdfunding platform.</p>\n\n<p>This will create an incentive to find more accommodations and will engage more hosts.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Making host deciding in large part where the money generated through their apartment goes risk to create a system where people support the project of their friend or something that they have an interest in.. But of course, it\'s possible to imagine also another way to let hosts support more a certain cause.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I proposed a model for the organization that is based on three levels:</p>\n\n<p>Foundation (Take care of the platform in general and connect the global community)</p>\n\n<p>National Associations (Help to select projects and to develop the organization in each state)</p>\n\n<p>Local Cooperatives (A group of citizens can apply to become a cooperative, it will have dedicated projects on the platform for that particular city, the aim is to do project together maybe about certain topics).</p>\n\n<p>I would like to share more on this, in my opinion a worldwide mobilization on those\xa0themes is very needed. Platforms have become the main infrastracture for the economy, we should act now where\'s still possible to make a change or we will be trapped:\xa0it will be harder and harder to compete with existing one (due to their network effects, data collected, availability of money, etc)</p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/noemi">@noemi</a> yes, but project will stay on the crowdfunding part of the platform for a limited time, so that new projects can join.</p>', u'post_id': 829, u'date': u'2017-05-12 13:34:15'}, {u'user_id': 3362, u'title': u'Interfacing for projects', u'comment_id': 23131, u'content': u'<p>Cool, this latest post of yours is basically what I was thinking reading the posts so far <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/damiano">@Damiano</a> .

I would focus on existing projects as first target group, as they have a good network usually, probably need money and will also put it to best use. In my opinion efforts are sometimes too much focussed on launching new things, instead of helping existing ones sustain themselves.</p>\n\n<p>What you are then doing is interfacing for projects to monetize excess capacity in their network. Instead of having to invest heavily into logistics, marketing, sales, everything that comes with selling something, you can rely on a \'service\' like yours.\xa0I think this ties in nicely with\xa0the discussion <a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/community-call-1-creating-a-simple-offer-and-process-for-participants/6135">here</a> on business models for The Reef.

Like you said, currently, these platforms are indispensable. The one thing I was wondering about though, is how you plan on recruiting the people who actually provide the service over to these new platforms?</p>\n\n<p>The reason being is that the people who choose to share their homes or cars with others are often already on these other platforms and until they start to move over to new platforms there is no way for I the user to actually access the platform. I.e. I can\'t order a ride when there is no driver available.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I was wondering if some of the money that doesn\'t go to overhead would result in slightly larger pay for the service providers? Of course, this then cuts into the amount of funding that could go\xa0towards new initiatives. I think this reflects some of the thoughts from this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong/transcript?language=en" rel="nofollow noopener">talk</a> by Dan Pallotta,\xa0namely that we are hesitant to use money as an incentive to create more business\xa0in the non-profit sector.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I think this type of platform is a timely and needed development.

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" rel="nofollow noopener">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> probably explains some of this. It works indirectly though: Literacy is something that tends to draw an intelligent crowd. Those people tend to read material produced by other relatively intelligent people. If you decide you also have something to contribute, you will often feel like you\'d better not be one of the worst of authors (even though for mere mortals there may not be a realistic way around that - as most people just need the practice). That means people who actually decide to write are a tiny minority and probably quite far from the average. So in short: writing does not produce (particularly much) anxiety, but it tends to draw an anxiety plagued crowd. When I read how fairly prolific writers approach the task (journalists on reddit, or academics for scientific proposals) I was shocked by the lack of rigor and decorum.</p>\n\n<p>The other item I fould almost universally helpful and reconiling is a list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases" rel="nofollow noopener">cognitive biases</a>.

I\'m new to the platform, indeed. I was kindly introduced to the thread by Noemi, my dear friend.</p>\n\n<p>You pointed out so well that being poor, scared and stressed out is as limiting as not practicing one\'s art as their profession! It\u2019s curious what makes people choose one or the other. One theory I heard recently at a sociology of arts conference was that people in these fields keep thinking that the next gig/exhibition etc. will be the big break. Costly naivety/ self-deceit \xa0<img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>So, the theory you mentioned and the article you recommended are new to me and I find they describe aspects of the arts-market relationship, amongst others, very accurately. Thank you for sharing this with me! Before reading these, I was thinking about how creative fields and other\xa0professions, like sports, have some similar stress sources, and this was confirmed and explained by the superstar economy theory.</p>\n\n<p>As useful and valid this is, I think it explains things only in part. One idea that comes to mind is the notoriously anxiety-inducing profession of writing. There seems to be something intrinsic about the creative craft that makes people doubt themselves completely. The tyranny of the white page could be well found in the white canvas \u2026</p>\n\n<p>Besides this intrinsic source of anxiety, which, again, I\'m quite uninformed about, I see a few more layers. As you were saying, Alberto, a strong one would be the characteristics of the winner-takes-it-all labor markets, and others might hover between the two, like self-belief, identity issues etc. I imagine a tension, a dynamic.</p>\n\n<p>Noemi, you phrased it wonderfully talking about the pressures of "how to carry yourself in the world" as an artist. In particular, the fact that the distinction or the separation between art and life, professional and personal evaporate within the arts (from creators to art professionals) would be a generous source of tension.</p>\n\n<p>One question that crosses my mind: how much of this is penetrating within the non-creative spheres as side-effect of the creative turn, the requirement for creativity, the curated self, etc.?</p>\n\n<p>By way of conclusion -\xa0I\'m 30 now and I\'ve been practicing self-deceit and strategic thinking, in turns, for more than\xa05 years now.

I don\'t think I have read anything by you before. You make some excellent points, particularly that of artists sharing some of those stress-inducing working conditions with non-artists. You mention art workers; where I come from (Italy) there is similar talk around freelancers.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Trained as an economist, having been a professional musician for several years in the 1990s, I looked up economic literature about the arts. The intuition most relevant to your point (and the whole thread) is this: art is defined by economies of scale in consumption. It works like this. Imagine you like classic two guitars-bass-drums rock music. Well, that technology scales really well: you can enjoy a rock concert in a bar with an audience of 30 people, or in a football stadium with an audience of 80,000. The costs of giving a concert increases in the size of the audience, but much slower than the ticket revenues. If you double your audience, your profit does not double: it goes up fourfold, or even tenfold, depends on where you start. Markets with these characteristics are called winner-takes-it-all: they produce few superstars, with everyone else doing badly (Rosen\'s <a href="http://www.ppge.ufrgs.br/giacomo/arquivos/ecop72/rosen-1981.pdf">classic 1981 paper</a>). While stars tend to be very talented people, it is simple to build a model that takes performers with\xa0<em>identical</em>\xa0characteristics, and then makes one or a few of them superstars, and discards the others. Initial lucky breaks are reinforced by the success-breeds-success dynamics. We need a hairdresser every ten blocks, because people go to different hairdressers. But very few stars, because we all watch/listen to/read the\xa0<em>same\xa0</em>ones.</p>\n\n<p>Now, you\xa0<em>really</em>\xa0do not want to work in a labour market that makes superstars. Whoever you are, probability says that you are almost certainly a loser in the race.\xa0That\'s extremely stress inducing.\xa0But artists do work there. And so do others, as you point out.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Tentative conclusion. Maybe it\'s not creativity that is stressful: it\'s the characteristics of winner-takes-it-all\xa0labor markets, including the one\xa0for\xa0artists. Implications: hard call. I fully appreciate that being creative in your spare time is limiting. But so is being poor, scared and stressed out. My own choice was relatively easy, given that I was obviously no artistic genius, and other things interested me just as much as music: I got the hell out of it after making it to midlevel (gold record in a secondary market such as Italy), but not to stardom\xa0<img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 680, u'date': u'2016-11-08 18:04:00'}, {u'user_id': 3479, u'title': u"If it's not too late to join the discussion", u'comment_id': 32092, u'content': u'<p>Hi everyone.</p>\n\n<p>I can only speak for the contemporary art scene, which is the one I\u2019m part of and not for theatre or other subdomains of the creative field. I see two main directions in the discussion so far.</p>\n\n<p>First, there\u2019s the question of creativity and anxiety being intertwined, and how to identify the moment when this anxiety crosses over to a dangerous zone for the artist; also, if this link is a given, how would we go about trying to keep an artist in the safety zone without hindering the creative dimension. Going back to what has been noted so far, the idea of the artist as troubled soul is rooted in the romantic definition of the artist, which I think has long been overcome within contemporary art (and made room for other sources of angst). Nevertheless, apart from this dated, unhealthy perspective, there might be an actual connection between the artistic predisposition and emotional volatility. I haven\u2019t read any studies on this topic, though I suppose this is a strong area of research and only after making sense of the results we might be able to think of strategies for improvement. These might be seen as issues concerning the psychology of arts, which I\u2019m not at all familiar with.</p>\n\n<p>Then, there is the layer of high (or high<em>er</em>?) anxiety levels within the art world as a result of the pressures of the specific field. Here I\u2019m referring to aspects that could be integrated within the sociology of arts (which I have more understanding of) like rampant competition, status issues (the art world is strongly hierarchical), precarious living/working conditions, high levels of uncertainty (not only of day to day life but the artist\u2019s own\xa0sense of identity as an artist), market/ commercialization contamination and so on.</p>\n\n<p>At one point in his article <em>The Curatorial Muse</em>, Michael J. Kowalski writes: \u201cIt is acknowledged, though not often discussed in polite company until the third drink, that the arts are defined by the same Darwinian savagery as any another profession. It is also acknowledged that the aspiration of art to beauty and truth is a pious fiction, but in the best possible sense of the word. Finally, and crucially, it\'s acknowledged that these two characteristics of art are seriously and permanently at odds with one another\u201d. - (<a href="http://www.contempaesthetics.org" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.contempaesthetics.org</a>)</p>\n\n<p>One important idea here is to note that these are not concerning artists only, but art workers in general. It\u2019s difficult for me to say if the levels of anxiety are higher in art that in other professions. A good point was made earlier that these might be found in any other field. My impression is, though, that fields in which creativity is profoundly linked with identity will always make for a more stressful environment. And for those that already identify with the psichological pressures of creativity, this later layer might be just too much to handle.</p>\n\n<p>Just a few more personal notes: in my discussions with artists I found that many drop out from University because they can\u2019t take the pressure. It might be helpful to note that the myth of the emergent artist will bring the issues I identified before as pertaining to the sociology of art very early on in an artist\u2019s life \u2013 from the first years of university. This young age, one that is related to learning, experimenting, trial and error, finding one\u2019s path etc., has become a battlefield for launching careers. (My one experience brings this even earlier in life, being a child and a teenager trying to become a professional musician. I am one of those who could not handle the difficulties of a musical career at such an early stage in my life and lacking a good support system, so I quit. At present I work as a passionate art professional - curating, arts management, teaching, cultural PR - and I find the field highly demanding, but I feel I have more resources in myself to work my way through, than\xa0I did when I was a young musician.)</p>\n\n<p>Another key point in artists\u2019 lives that my friends who are painters pointed out to me is finishing their studies and trying to make a living through their art and not make compromises. The attention to each decision is overwhelming for most young artists: they need to make a living but most of the times their options put them in a compromising position they know they might not recover from, the art world being so much about reputation management and legitimation. Whenever I think of the contemporary art world I have in my mind the picture of a chess board. One needs to learn the rules of the game by playing, and you only get one round.</p>\n\n<p>The other day I was listening to Sarah Thornton, a sociologist of art who was pointing out that ever since Duchamp, the freedom of the artist to fashion herself as an artist is a demigod position that puts a lot of pressure especially on artists finishing studies, whom\xa0are very much aware of the responsibility of designating themselves as artists. Many would not use the word artist, Thornton notes, and when asked what they do, they say \u201cI do work\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Of course, older age comes with its own anxieties within the arts, namely the obsession with youth...</p>\n\n<p>But to conclude, I\u2019d say that once clarified what aspects you guys are more interested in working with, there would be specific/ specialized ways to enable care and help. It might be that it is not even relevant if the creative field is more prone to anxiety than others, but wanting to reduce these big emotional costs would require a particular approach, one that suits the idiosyncrasies of the field. I\u2019d be very interested to contribute within my own area of knowledge and experience -\xa0I say there\u2019s a strong need for open care structures here.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 680, u'date': u'2016-11-08 11:37:19'}, {u'user_id': 3468, u'title': u'The traumatized self healing artist myth', u'comment_id': 31535, u'content': u'<p>The theory <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/ybe">@ybe</a> has contributted is a very accurate example of the destructive narrative I was talking about in the first place.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 680, u'date': u'2016-10-27 09:18:41'}, {u'user_id': 3403, u'title': u'view of a psychotraumatologist <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">', u'comment_id': 31148, u'content': u'<p>What an interesting discussion, thx to you all. I agree that stress and suffering are part of life <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/noemi">@noemi</a> <span class="mention">@odin</span> <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/alberto">@Alberto</a>, that stress to some degree even make us thrive, grow <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/steelweaver">@steelweaver</a>. But in the end stress should not become bigger than our coping skills, it should not be overwhelmingly disturbing.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In general, I think of art and creativity as an expression of oneself, an expression of our inner world, our \'being\' in the world, our being \'me\'. Being authentic is by definition being different from others and thus coping with judgment,\xa0 the others , the outer world goes along with it.</p>\n\n<p>But I also think that feeling different, an outsider, more sensitive than others, etc etc .. is often a \'symptom\' of trauma, a result of not having our needs met in the past f.ex, wich often results in losing our own connection with our needs, our connection with ourself.\xa0 This disconnection is trauma, the residu of pain. In my vision many artists are trying to \'heal\' themselves through their art - redefine themselves, trying to find a way to become \'whole\' again - integrate pain and trauma. Artists are often \'self-healers\', they are their own therapists.</p>\n\n<p>When the self-healing fails, they might consider exploring the pain and trauma trough different glasses - those of a therapist. Thinking out of the box could help them cope better <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>This is the more or less classic, freudian, psychological explanation for \'artistic pain\'.</p>\n\n<p>There is another explanation though, one that is defended by one of the founding fathers of expressive arts therapy S.K. Levine : that art is the expression of our soul, our \'acorn\', that we are born with a \'mission\', something we want to express, and that the struggle to discover and express this acorn, this individual mission causes pain. Levine thinks we overfocus on pain and trauma caused by environment/youth/parents... We should instead in therapy look more for \'the inborn authenticity, the inborn self\'.</p>\n\n<p>(If interesetd in this latter explanation: See <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Trauma-Tragedy-Therapy-Human-Suffering-ebook/dp/B00C0YTBQI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477407682&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=stephen+k+levine" rel="nofollow noopener">Stephen K.

At school he was artistic and a left hander, naturally talented at sport, and very sensitive (for example, he once walked into a house and sensed a ghost, which the owners later confirmed; another time, he avoided a major accident because he sensed something and changed his route on his motorbike). Life has been a bit of a struggle for him - he has pursued conventional success and it didn't suit his temperament and he complains about life being constant suffering (although sometimes it as if he seems to enjoy the suffering, otherwise why would he keep doing it?). He also drinks alcohol a lot - I have always asssumed this is because he finds life challenging, because he is so sensitive.\xa0 Having said this, he is still creative and charming and loveable.

I\'ve found some of the comments below to be helpful and insightful, but some to be problematic.</p>\n\n<p>There is certainly a strong link through poetry and literature to this idea. I\'ve recently been reading a lot of Thomas Mann and it\'s almost the entire structure on which his work is predicated. There seems to have been a sensibility that was propagrated in the late 1800s -early 1900s European intellectual/artisan culture around \'bohemianism\' or latterly \'bourgouise\'. I think in some senses it emerges out of a combination of Romanticism (in poetry and visual art) and it\'s opposite reaction,\xa0Realism (in painting and literature) and the beginnings of the sentimental nostalagia-tinged\xa0classical music of people like\xa0Verdi and the German/Austrians like Liszt, Mendelsohn.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The \'struggling artist\' becomes a trope, a series of hooks onto which musicians, writers and painters can hang their emotional responses to the world. The struggles of the artist can therefore\xa0be equated to the struggles of the working, pastoral man and woman, who often during this period are the themes on which the artist work. c.f Beethoven\'s 6th, Robert\xa0Burn\'s Poetry, Victor Hugo. Which becomes an important connection between the (usually rich, educated and entitled) artists and the philosophy of people like Rosseau and Locke who want to improve the human condition for all.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>More of a History of Art and Ideas response to the idea, and certainly not my final views on the subject, but i thought i\'d add a bit more to this already in-depth post.</p>\n\n<p>Also, worth having a quick read of this piece i found today:\xa0<a href="http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/literary-madness/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/literary-madness/</a></p>', u'post_id': 680, u'date': u'2016-11-24 10:35:57'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'"I hate my work" syndrome', u'comment_id': 13151, u'content': u'<p>On a lighter note... <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="xm7awfl6hYA" data-youtube-title="Why Artists Are Never Happy" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>', u'post_id': 680, u'date': u'2017-05-25 09:33:28'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'Schizotypy!', u'comment_id': 13033, u'content': u'<p>Very grateful for the material, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/alan">@alan</a> !

In my limited experience, most EU doctoral programs are biased towards young, highly competitive candidates. Usually, more senior individuals access doctoral tracks by tertiary funding (e.g. the company hiring them covers the full university costs, and maintains them on payrol).</p>\n\n<p>Can you share with us how the idea of a PhD was selected, among other alternatives? Is it for the student status/visa? Or for the need to receive economic support? If their titles/certificates are at hand (which I presume, since they do not want to enrol in a bachelor, but in a doctorate), why not seeking a professional position (lecturer, lab technician, ...)? If they have tried and failed, could you share a bit more about this, to figure out what is the situation...</p>\n\n<p>In general, no one size fits all in academic careers... It\'s my humble opinion, but for the double issue you are bringing to our attention,\xa0I\xa0am somewhat skeptical that anyone will be able to say "get in touch with X" or "look up on Y"... each solution will be custom tailored on the history and professional profile of the person.

It's just that open protest might not be the way to go. Instead, it might be being kind to one's oppressors. Or treating them with empathy. Nonviolent Communication is a good set of principles in many settings. But people have to be human. What good is non-violence in face of a pack of hungry wolves or hyenas?

Not so much city\xa0<em>planning\xa0</em>as city\xa0<em>making</em>, directly. It happens in three cities: Yerevan, Armenia; Rustavi, Georgia; and Luxor, Egypt, under the aegis of the United Nations Development Programme. Working with UNDP, we have noticed that there are groups of people who are trying to "edit"\xa0the city as if it were a wiki, without necessarily going through all the mandated procedure. Some of the "edits" are good, great in fact: look at this Cairo neighborhood were people got out with\xa0<em>bulldozers</em>\xa0and build <a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/constructing-a-ring-road-exit-by-the-people-egypt">four new ramps to access the ring road</a>!\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In Future Makers. the city authorities and the\xa0local "city hackers" agree on a street, or a square, or a park, that is marked as "editable". Within the limits set, everything is allowed, as long as the people build it themselves. We will then see what happens.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Future Makers has a workspace here on this platform, but they have decided to keep it private, so, I can\'t share what they do with you.

However the currency is just a tool, what is most important is the vision and the values that incorporate the efforts. In Thessaloniki, we started quite recently but there is already some places that joined and we hope to see more of them joining very soon.

But we hope that cooperation can help with all the progress. The biggest challenge I see is trust and empowerment, people to trust each other and believe that collectively they can change things. So trust to each other and trust to collective power, rather than being disconnected and antagonistic. From so many sides we are being trained to not trust each other and our collective power, but I believe that culture is gradually changing and people are becoming more inclined to create communities and cooperate. Technology and to a certain extent the economic crisis have supported that.</p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/simonedb">@Simonedb</a> I agree with you that it is extremely important to remain open to other ideas and projects, and this is why we were so happy to participate at the Edgeryders workshop in Thessaloniki where we met this amazing community of people!

What a fascinating story.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The question of interaction is an interesting one. At this stage in my planning, I don't envisage any direct interaction other than commenting on / sharing the stories that are published via\xa0social media. This is important in emphasising the privacy and security of the platform when it is launched later in the year. When this happens, people - everyone -\xa0will be able to create profiles for their own relatives to which invited family, carers and friends can contribute. But these profiles will only be visible to those who have been given permission and, in this context, Remarkable Lives operates as a private family social network. It is also to take in account the sensitivity around the demographic's profile - we're talking about older people in society, some who are vulnerable and for whom privacy needs to be safeguarded.</p>\n\n<p>That said, there will be the facility for profiles to be made public, for example if someone has created a profile for themselves (imagine an 80-something tech-savvy person) and is happy to be 'found'. In that instance, you would be able to make contact with that person and send a message and, feasibly, begin interacting that way.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this answers your question.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Owen</p>", u'post_id': 6289, u'date': u'2017-05-08 11:03:20'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Interaction?', u'comment_id': 10075, u'content': u'<p>Hello <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/owen_mcneir">@Owen_McNeir</a> , welcome and thanks for the proposal.

I wonder: what\'s your plan for interaction? What happens if I think Jean or Derek seem\xa0cool, and I want to reach out?

My band was a sort of Italian version of The Pogues, keenly interested in a "folk" collective narration of Italian recent history. We are almost an amnesiac country, and it is hard to gain access to first-hand experiences from the messy times of war, Nazi occupation, partisan guerrilla, collaborationists etc. Long story short, I started\xa0asking around and ended up in the house of Germano Nicolini, a former partisan commander and Resistance hero, later disgraced because suspected guilty of the political murder of a priest (happened in 1946), and finally found innocent (after 10 years in jail) in the mid 1990s, 50 years after the crime. No Google, no six\xa0degrees, no nothing. We wrote and published a fairly successful song about Nicolini\'s story. It put him on the radar of popular culture: while not exactly a celebrity, he became a respected voice, one of too few real elders in the Italian left\'s tribe.</p>\n\n<p>He now has his own <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germano_Nicolini">Wikipedia page</a>, but at the time he was floatsam and jetsam of history, just another freedom fighter gone bad. I am telling you this story because I understand the value of oral memory, and of personal relationship with the past. But I did need to wash up at Nicolini\'s doorstep, and ring his bell. I remember his initial guardedness: my story made sense to him ("you are part of my history, I want a first hand account"), but it was way out of his experience, as of my own.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 6289, u'date': u'2017-05-05 08:47:39'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Roger that', u'comment_id': 10855, u'content': u'<p><img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 6279, u'date': u'2017-05-08 10:02:42'}, {u'user_id': 3362, u'title': u'Pieces coming together', u'comment_id': 6778, u'content': u'<p>I\'ve been thinking and talking to our team, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> &amp; others.

I will share with you few things in hope it is beneficial :).</p>\n\n<p>Haven\'t felt depression in years, sadness very rarely and short termed. I believe sadness comes from our inability to accept a certain situation, our resistence to it. If there is a situation we don\'t like we have only two choices: Accept it as it is or change it or at least try to change it. In both situations we shouldn\'t be depressed. If de did all in our power and failed to change it, we should be satisfied with ourselves and accept the outcome, since there is no alternative. However i do believe once sadness comes we should not try to supress it, let it run its course because anything else would be commiting violence upon our own nature and sadness would still manifest itself somehow.</p>\n\n<p>Good at school, always calm and good kid, inventive, reading since i was 5, playing chess since my 6th year...i can\'t really tell how many times i heard my family members say this dreadful phrase to their children: "just take Jasen\'s example, can\'t you be like him".\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Than i was 27, married, hated my job, didn\'t love my wife, i was miserable and had a lot of health issues. I started wondering: "how did i end up right here at this moment in life?" I knew i totally went off my path but didn\'t yet realise how or where is my path.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>After realising\xa0the community in which i grew up actually applied huge subconscious pressure on me through their projections of myself, through their expectations especially, and that so many of my life\'s actions were led by those thoughts in my head which were not really my thoughts. (i actually got married because everyone was telling me it\'s the right time and after some time it made sense...how crazy!).</p>\n\n<p>My next step was\xa0selfexploration, i had to get to know myself. I stayed at home reading books for months, Carlos Castaneda\'s books were an amazing discovery at that time. I went into nature for periods of isolation where i spent my time in silence and thought, and finally after some time i started meditating.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>As far as success is concerned i agree with Alberto. Should we measure ourselves in comparison to others or by finding our own system of values and definition of success? For example i have 0 debt, built my own house by the age of 28, a good\xa0car and pretty much anything i need materially now...most of my friends think i am succesful. I would however consider myself succesful if i could succeed in creating a well balanced family full of love and respect, or if i could be nothing but a positive and inspiring experience for anyone who meets me. Or if i could attain permanent state of meditation for example. Also i have been with many women, and ofcourse friends\xa0i went out with always considered me lucky or succesful with women. Well again my definition of success is very different: i would have preferred to stay with the first one i loved...or with any i loved. Now, in retrospective i rather think i failed miserably with some of those women and brought really bad kharma on me through those "successes" :).</p>', u'post_id': 666, u'date': u'2016-04-26 01:42:16'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u"Don't try this alone", u'comment_id': 24963, u'content': u'<p>Inspiring, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/kiravde">@KiraVde</a> and <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/ivan">@ivan</a> (welcome back to both of you!). But I don\'t think it\'s quite that simple. "Being different", going by a different value system, is itself entropic. Here\'s why: to accomplish anything, we humans need other humans. Other humans are attracted by "successful" (as per the dominant canon of what "successful" means). Moreover, we suffer from a documented psyhological bias called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect">halo effect</a>, that makes us assume that success trasfers across domains. If you are a successful marathon runner, I will rate higher your\xa0chances of starting a viable company, even though the skills involved with running marathons are not the same ones needed to run a business. People will help more gladly others when they think they are winners. By doing so, they will increase the chances of success of these perceived winners.\xa0So, being <em>perceived</em> as successful increases your chances of <em>actually</em> being successful.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>That\'s not to say you cannot define your own measure of success. But it does mean this is a lot easier when done in tribes. If you inhabit a cluster of the global social graph that goes by different rules, you are kind of OK being different, because your social network is also different, and that means you can mobilize those people to help in whatever it is you are doing. You can enjoy a reasonable measure of social esteem, even if it is localized in your corner of the graph.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>An unfortunate consequence of this is that, the more different you want to be, the more energy\xa0you need to invest promoting yourself. The message is "look at me, I am not a failure, I am a success by my own measure". Social media are full of this, often cloaked in hyper-individualistic narratives, of the "I quit my day job to follow my dream" type. Which is ironic, because\xa0hyper-individualists (if they exist) do not care about what people on Facebook think of them. Self-promotion is, in my opinion, the expression of a deep need\xa0for social acceptance.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 666, u'date': u'2016-04-26 08:07:33'}, {u'user_id': 258, u'title': u'Afraid of relaxing?', u'comment_id': 23909, u'content': u'<p>I feel your plea, and as <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/kiravde">@KiraVde</a> says I also wish I would not give too many fucks.</p>\n\n<p>Myself, I am afraid of taking things easy and slowing down, because I feel that if I am not going forward I am going backwards (by whatever standard!) and.. what if I stopped caring?

It turned out to be very challenging, but at least it was not the usual challenge \u2013 it was a different one.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>My personal way to look at it is to draw inspiration from biology. In the natural world, there is no one but you to underwrite your pains. Even parasites have to be good at parasitism, or they will die as individuals or go extinct as a species. At the same time, a successful species in biology is definied as one well adapted to its ecological niche,\xa0<em>not\xa0</em>in terms of how close it is to to the top of the food chain. A frog is not a failed crocodile: it is a successful animal by its own yardstick. Put a crocodile in a European pond, he\'ll starve to death, whereas frogs do just fine. By the same token, it would be weird to say that a craftsman is a failed CEO! He is just not.</p>\n\n<p>We should not take the analogy too far, of course.

In that case, the first move is probably to accept it, and decide you are going to measure yourself\xa0in some other way.\xa0Maybe, then, it will not be a vulnerability at all that you do not like ticking boxes!

The idea is that, in humans, culture and biology intertwine dynamically: evolutionary pressure makes us evolve mixed packages of genes and culture that make us fitter for survival. These packages repurpose and harness pre-existent packages. If you want to know more, <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10543.html">this book</a> is a fantastic introduction.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Researchers in this area have figured out why humans have evolved rites of passage, which can be very costly (in some tribes, young men especially have to go through gruesome trials to become full members of the tribe). So where\'s the benefit? The benefit is that these rituals cement the tribe\'s cohesion, making it more fit to withstand intergroup competition, a major driver of human evolution (and suspected to have been a driver of non-human primates before we came around). How can rituals cement cohesion across participants? They harness certain biases in human cognition. For example, it has been found that doing things in sync enhances the propensity to cooperate. Consider the following\xa0experiment.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Participants are randomly\xa0divided in two groups. People in group A are asked to perform a simple physical act in sync with each other, like clapping hands. People in group B are asked to per form the same act, but not in sync.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>All participants are asked to play a simple\xa0game where they need to choose between a "cooperate" and a "defect" strategy, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">Prisoner\'s dilemma</a>.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Members of group A have a measurably higher probability to cooperate.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, to make strangers connect, a sensible strategy seems to be to "think like a hacker" and\xa0exploit the biases in human cognition, such as the tendency to cooperate more with people you have done something in sync with. A major bias is that we seem\xa0to be hardwired for forming groups.

As far as what was the \u201ccrossover\u201d there were numerous reasons. One of the main factors that I think diminished the resistance, was realizing that within a group of people, and the diverse cultures, there was a slew of similarities. The challenges were the same, the way the challenge presented itself may have been different. Students seeing breakthrough conversations- gaining confidence to overcome challenges. The safety net of the group/community and explore better ways of interacting with others. The strict standards of confidentiality were equally as important. Records of participation were not accessible to parents, teachers, faculty, and deans etc. Unless there were certain circumstances. The students themselves had to give authorization for anyone\u2019s inquiry. Which made the students in control of the situation.\xa0 Which is always of value.</p>\n\n<p>Being a university student \u2013 as you know -- can be a difficult balancing act. It is easy to get weighed down with the pressures of academics, social life, and choosing a major and so on.\xa0 If personal problems are piled on top of these pressures, it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed. There were different groups and workshops which made it easy for them to identify with.</p>\n\n<p>There was distress tolerance, learning how to improve coping skills, groups range in\xa0diverse areas.\xa0 Workshops were topical with a therapeutic focus and the students realized they were helping each other. Encouraging open and frank discussions while getting to the core. As a psychology student, we started a group with the focus of awareness of mental health and resilience (it started as a project) For students by students -showing support is beneficial to manage the inevitable ups and downs and the resources available. \xa0Mental wellness was brought into the light \u2013 which it\u2019s ok to talk about it. From there the students that were not really \u201cinterested\u201d took another look at the options available with a different perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Years later when working with JP Morgan Investment in NYC I did facilitate\u2013 employee support programs.</p>\n\n<p>@ <a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/building-tweeting-communities-for-mental-health-nursing-with-wemhnurses/518">the Story</a> you mentioned- quite interesting! open discussions help.....\xa0can\u2019t get any more open than Twitter. \xa0Using it to share info, raise awareness and openly discuss mental health problems from different perspectives.\xa0Social media is changing the world, and its changing how people with issues connect with each other.

There are substantial benefits to group therapy, in addition to human and contact and the openness of being completely vulnerable. Too often, there is a stigma attached and people don\u2019t want to share their experience and rather keep in within. \xa0Group therapy helps realize you\u2019re not alone. Many patients enter therapy with the disquieting thought that they are unique in their situation, that they alone have certain frightening or unacceptable problems and thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>While it\u2019s true that each of us is unique and may have unique circumstances, none of us is alone in our struggles. \xa0It great reduces isolation and alienation. It increases the sense that \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together,\u201d and kind of normalizes the individual situations. While members, in turn, encourage each other for support, feedback, and connection, instead of getting all that from the clinician.\xa0 By sharing experiences we all learn from each other and navigate out of their current situation and ultimately helps to find your voice in the sense of relating to others.\xa0 On the flipside, it takes strength and some recognition of the needs of others to function well in a group, not be destroyed by it. Creating the community atmosphere to overcome challenges and gain confidence.</p>\n\n<p>On another note, at university, they had \u201cprograms\u201d in place and designed to enhance the student\u2019s life, as <span class="mention">@Sharon</span>\xa0mentioned young adults can be very hard on themselves.\xa0 Aided in concerns or problems such as a feeling of low self-esteem, anxiety, depression and academic concerns.</p>\n\n<p>It was made almost mandatory by the dean and resident advisers to participate in these groups. There was resistance at first by many and that kind of tapered off. Being a psychology major we helped develop these groups in collaboration with various student groups. It was quite astonishing to see the resistance then you see the connection that was made over time and the participants, well some of them anyway changed their direction and went into this field so maybe it was a chance to tap into their real path they were destined to follow. Through difficulties, we usually discover what we were meant to do. Each one teach one to reach one! Networks can indeed support and enhance the quality of life and provide a buffer against adverse life events and difficulties.</p>', u'post_id': 810, u'date': u'2017-03-28 05:11:13'}, {u'user_id': 3403, u'title': u'@Sharon you are so right to say that ', u'comment_id': 24078, u'content': u'<p><span class="mention">@Sharon</span> you are so right to say that deep healing comes through human contact and openess -</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for sharing your story with us</p>', u'post_id': 810, u'date': u'2017-01-21 13:52:31'}, {u'user_id': 3533, u'title': u'Undisclosed content ', u'comment_id': 22821, u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 810, u'date': u'2017-01-22 13:11:29'}, {u'user_id': 3362, u'title': u'Thanks, some thoughts', u'comment_id': 22611, u'content': u'<p>Thanks for taking the time to write your views on things <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/sharon_kinnane">@Sharon_Kinnane</a> .</p>\n\n<p>It\'s a harsh truth that there is no cookie cutter strategy, that everyone has to go through their own process, solve their own puzzle. Although this process is different for everyone, for each part of it there are similarities with someone, somewhere. To me it appears that a big part of the search is identifying pieces of your puzzle\xa0in other people (eg. some advice)\xa0and testing if it gets you closer to finishing your puzzle. That\'s where community comes in handy: a large group of people equals a lot of potentially useful pieces. The analogy is a simplification, but it helps me make sense of it.</p>\n\n<p>You say\xa0some people find the idea of a group therapy unsettling. I am one of those people. It\'s not the sharing with strangers or\xa0the speaking up. I could even live with\xa0the religious connotations, though I have a light allergy to most things that involve ritual. I think the reason is the lack of richness I experience in these group interactions. I find one on one conversations\xa0or reading people\'s stories like yours\xa0much more rewarding.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>However, when I went through a darker period, it was also a group of people that helped me get out. It was a series of stories and great conversations, offline and online, one person at a time. Most of them will never meet each other.</p>\n\n<p>Defining what constitutes a community, a group, or what is just\xa0collection of individuals that share a friend is not the point.\xa0I guess you could say that the form the group or community takes differs for everyone. Or that the healing process is about meaningful interactions with others, however that may work for you.

The way the meeting was managed made also a difference. In fact City of Milan started \u201cadmitting\u201d that the law (see above) was created without enough stakeholders\u2019 engagements and it resulted in limited compliances. The meeting was the occasion to amend the situation by experimenting a talk at a different level based more on moral suasion than power games.</p>\n\n<p>When <span class="mention">@Rossana</span> introduced the Open care approach and <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/costantino">@Costantino</a> talked about the co-design method, people were interested as well as suddenly engaged. It seems it worked. Since we announced we\u2019d organize a couple of co-design sessions, we\u2019ll see how many people will actively engage.</p>\n\n<p>In her introductory speech, the City councilor Cristina Tajani\xa0said that helping enforcing this law isn\u2019t just fair and mandatory, but it may also turn economically profitable for local businesses. Implying that more accessible businesses might have more clients among disabled and caregivers, but also among people that favors living in an equal opportunity neighborhood. This is the point to me. I have the feeling that this initiative is going to be successful here (a track of what\u2019s going on will be provided as it happens) because of the nature of this area.</p>\n\n<p>This place, even if it\u2019s recently gentrified, succeeded in keeping its original community spirit. There are plenty of small independent shops, recreational spaces, associations and spontaneous groups. People who cares. In other words it doesn\u2019t take a single specific reason to wish shops and restaurants to be accessible for all. People, at times, might just follow their sense of community and contribute. \xa0\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 819, u'date': u'2017-04-21 12:40:37'}, {u'user_id': 2551, u'title': u'Dynamics a little different here', u'comment_id': 22307, u'content': u'<p>I would imagine (given enough info flow to the potential users) the first couple of shops to do it would get the largest share of extra customers.

Waste water filters, air pollution scrubbers... guys, these are opportunities!\xa0</p>\n\n<p>It was not true. Not really.

In my home region, Emilia-Romagna, we have a strong cycling tradition \u2013 it is unusually flat for Italy, and that helps.\xa0When I moved to Milano in 2001, I found cycling much more difficult because of a deadly combination of cobblestones, tram tracks and just sheer traffic nastyness.\xa0Bicycle lanes where almost absent. As a consequence, only "extreme cycling" happened: young, fit\xa0men who wore tactical backpacks, army boots and yelled at drivers, and even kicked at their cars. I could just about cope: my (Swedish) wife refused to cycle, saying it was too dangerous. Extreme bikers did things like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/11a17d67f639a63ee13b23948ecf39e174f423ba.jpg" width="500" height="359"></p>\n\n<p>But over the years those extreme people have become sort of cool. A company called <a href="http://www.urbanbm.it/">Urban Bike Messengers</a> established a bicycle-based delivery service. They cultivated an image of green, cool and a bit scary. Rumour was that, to become a messenger, you had to pass a near-impossible test of crossing the city only in minutes. This encouraged more people to go out and bike. This, in turn, made biking a little safer for everyone, because drivers learned to be a little more attentive. So even more people got out. By the time I left the city, the Decathlon shop in Cairoli was selling 50 to 100 bicycles\xa0<em>a day.</em>\xa0Eventually, the city council started to take\xa0cyclists a bit more seriously; traffic was restricted in the center, some slightly better bike lanes appeared.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>What this story has to teach is that, perhaps, if you want to make life better for paraplegics you have to start from the urban sport enthusiasts.

For the two last, we develop open-source hardware to capture pressure and flow, using Arduino or Raspberry Pi. One additional layer is that these technologies are collectively created, which enables to increase awareness about respiratory health. <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 6274, u'date': u'2017-04-30 23:06:29'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Hard to disagree!', u'comment_id': 8238, u'content': u'<p>Hello\xa0<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/breathinggames"></a><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/breathinggames">@breathinggames</a>\xa0, it\'s hard to disagree. Elsewhere in the project we have documented that a shift happens when the care-receiver is also the payer: suddenly, prevention becomes far and away the best way to spend your money (and time) on care. This is rare, because the person receiving care is almost never the person who pays for the care: the payer is either the state (more in Europe) or insurers (more in the USA). This is associated with an attention to therapy and a de-prioritisation of prevention.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I looked brefly at your games. It seems the first three are about teaching people with respiratory conditions what to do or not do, whereas the fourth is a quantified self kind of thing, right?

I\'m not suggesting open source is more reliable, or the only way to go with medical devices. However, there is an issue of transparency of the code to the patient, that has \'similar\' issues to the issues of open source.</p>\n\n<p>On your other points though, you rightly note that there is a lot of safety and regulation around medical devices. However, we still know that user input issues pervade the safety of medical devices. For examples, see the paper Preventing Medication Errors by \xa0P Aspden, J Wolcott, J L Bootman, L R Cronenwett:, or any of a number of papers by Harold Thimbleby. The paper Killed by Code written by Sandler et al, also details many case studies that you might be interested in. Getting back to the point about safety regulation, I don\'t believe that safety regulation takes security into account as regularly. This istarting to happen, but very slowly. This is why the paper "Pacemakers and implantable cardiac defibrillators: Software radio attacks and zero-power defenses" is so powerful. They took an FDA certified device, and showed it was possible to make it operate unsafely after some security analysis.</p>\n\n<p>There are many more things we might discuss about regulation, such as the FDA\'s limited resources for looking at the code of the devices. However, there are some good things too, such as the MAUDE database. <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/search.CFM" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/search.CFM</a></p>\n\n<p>By making this database available, we can search for adverse events and study this in an evidence based approach, as you rightly request. I\'m not here to inflate the claims, and honestly I prefer to let Marie do the talking about these subject because her patient viewpoint is balanced and essential.

In Emilia il costo pieno (senza profitto) \xe8 stimato a 700 EUR al mese per bambino. E invece, le cooperative sociali che in Toscana gestiscono questi servizi l\'hanno denunciata e fatta chiudere: mancato rispetto delle normative regionali.\xa0Un approccio basato sui devianti positivi avrebbe invece concluso che a Firenze servono scuole dell\'infanzia basic, e creato uno spazio per la signora e per le altre persone come lei.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>La metodologia di opencare \xe8 molto adatta a trovare i devianti positivi. Si tratterebbe di fare un affondo su Milano, cercando le iniziative su cui la gente si sta automobilitando; queste sono le cose che servono davvero.

They are\xa0locked in how they have been doing things for years, naturally.</p>\n\n<p>For example, citizen science as an approach is overwhelmingly commonly\xa0reduced to an alternative method for collecting data. A tool, not a different process. A way to collect data\xa0and involve people a little by doing so, rather than involving people in the whole process and having them collect data in addition to formulating questions, designing experiments etc. all along the way.</p>\n\n<p>I was at a conference dedicated to the\xa0topic last week; a full programme, even quite diverse for most standards, and data\xa0collection and related issues were\xa0all anyone wanted to talk about. Insight does not progress if the wrong questions are being asked. It is detrimental if forms of participatory science are looked at only in this way.

Sorry for the late reply, your posts went under my radar. Interestingly though, the outlines of a similar approach have been forming for us since my post.</p>\n\n<p>Basic backstory: we are professionalising our services as a collective of freelancers. For recurring\xa0services we have simple formats (graphic design, workshops, ...) that are easily sold and applicable to many kinds of clients. Each team member has their own specific expertise, so the division there is easily made. Eg. the workshop guy would sell workshops, but meanwhile also be on the lookout for graphic design missions. One mission could involve both writing and graphics. Collaboration is easily coordinated there. The organisation stays agile, without dependencies, with a shared story. These are the easy advantages teaming up as freelancers offers.</p>\n\n<p>Projects, paid or not, are to be initiated and implemented by the champion (team member or volunteer) that proposes it, much like what you describe. Some more coordination is required and this is usually done by the champion. I'm sure the overdeliver idea is applicable to us in this early stage.\xa0Not so sure about\xa0the extra payment for carrying a project, as it varies a lot from industry to industry how much money is available for covering these costs. The client could\xa0have low funds (underfunded education system), there's plenty of competition (projects involving more generic services eg. web and graphic design) etc.</p>\n\n<p>Flagship projects do create openings for higher margin formats, if we can find a way to channel it there. A hard thing to quantify and it would increase dependencies again, projects being the indirect sales strategy for other formats. Many things to be aware of, curious to see what will work best.</p>", u'post_id': 4195, u'date': u'2017-03-13 19:58:35'}, {u'user_id': 8, u'title': u'Encourage, support and train more people to do public talks ', u'comment_id': 23272, u'content': u'<p>Also, build informal social events where people just meet.

We found out quickly that it does not work for a company like Edgeryders, small and new and trying to make way. Reason: we agreed we would try to grow based on overdelivery. We would compensate the risk taken by clients in hiring us by being excellent value for money. This means we would be hurt by taking 10% of or budget out to pay for the commission: we need all the money to provide the service. Essentially, we are foregoing commission to invest in reputation.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The problem is mitigated by none of us being\xa0<em>only</em>\xa0a salesperson. Each person in ER gets intrigued by a project, and tries to sell it because she means to then work on it. With us, the project's\xa0champion must lead it; almost always the champion is the one closing the deal, or having worked a lot on it. So we can compensate this person by paying her a little more generously once the sale has been made.

Its categories are very abstract: "Create spaces", "Map interests", "Create structure" etc. Each comes with deadline and deliverables. Each person running a project would fill in these fields as appropriate \u2013 in fact, quite similarly to what happens with European Commission-funded project (they have "Excellence", "Impact" etc.). Also the process people have used in the periscope case is similar: work on a GoogleDoc, then copy-paste into the Sensorica form. The point of copy-pasting seems to give people a way in to contribute (and be rewarded accordingly \u2013 kind of like Github + accounting). This is all reverse engineering, I am not actually seeing the accounting (no fields denominated in \u20ac or $ or whatever), but that might be due to my non-logged in status.</p>\n\n<p>We have a similar system, except no forms. You have a project, you post it as a group on the platform and receive your basic tools for cooperation (wikis, tasks etc.), loosely coupled with what the whole community is doing. This is meant to maximize the chance that somebody you don\'t know will randomly walk in and turn out to be exactly the person needed for that project. People are encouraged to find their own ay to share, under Who Does The Work Calls The Shots \u2013 doers decide.</p>\n\n<p>A problem in ER is turning out to be how to reward the quite difficult and not always fun activity of making the sales. Not rewarding encourages waiting around for someone to walk in with a contract; rewarding it seems quite awkward, at least before you have some hard data on what it costs to do that kind of work (accounting for all the failed pitches).

It\'s tricky.\xa0"</p>\n\n<p>First, what is the value system? We need to map it first and that will determine how to set everything up for value to be created, distributed and for the benefits to be shared among participants. Second, there is a choice to be made about the type of environment we want to create. Is it about creating value in a corporate-type environment or in a peer production environment. Nadia\'s words above suggest that something like the second choice is preferred. People like us need to be free, want to contribute to different projects, want to be able to influence and take ownership of processes, want to share... So how do you set up an environment that allows value creation and its distribution but feels like a network and is build on openness, transparency, decentralized processes? This question is at the core of my activities since 2008 and my answer is the Open Value Network (OVN) model. There are a lot of hybrid models that try to go in that direction but preserve some of the old stuff, and I think that is because people are not ready or can\'t go all the way. Within SENSORICA \xa0all projects are open, everyone can perform tasks, no barrier to value creation, and we use the value accounting system to redistribute the revenue. Networks that have projects formalized as a company, incubators and accelerators for example, don\'t have a lot of co-creation or exchanges between these entities. Within a value network projects are open and are only loosely formalized. If you have a system to track contributions you\'ll get a lot of value flows between projects, synergy increases, there is a lot of recycling and sharing of tangible and intangible resources. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>We are now prototyping services.

And we started selling services with the platform only in February 2015 (so 1 year and almost 6 months after).

Or both?</p>\n\n<p>For me buying a land and a farm sounds most interesting - because of the costs, because of the location (out of the city, obviously well connected, but also in an underprivileged, a maybe slightly abandoned area that would use a community and an investment) and access to farming land. I was looking lately into offers in Portugal, and discussing it with one of my friends, and it's easy to find something rather cheaply - for 40, 70, 100.000 euros for a big piece of land there. Portugal is well connected by highways and has relatively many airports around. For me living in a big city in Europe is not that interesting anymore anyway:)</p>\n\n<p>About the model, it will greatly depend on the space - and vice versa. I would see it as a mix of super cheap or free accommodations\xa0for people who work on things (fellowships, residencies), residential spaces for those who want to invest long term in it where we also cover the costs, and a business model - high-quality rooms we could rent short term, but also services. If we manage to build a community where various practices of care are available, this could be a source of revenue. We could start offering training for companies in well-being. Or open a section for a couple of elderly people, paid, but affordable.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>These ideas could build up into a de facto village we would be running there.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The village could be at least partly financed by the crowdfunding campaign, but once we have this sorted, we should submit the very same plan to Velo foundation in Denmark that offers support in purchasing real estate for organizations. And if we connect LOTE with this land purchase, we can actually, once in a lifetime, offer a chance to buy tickets for the event with the intention that the money from the tickets (and merchandise) goes to renovation and so on. It won't be compulsory - it would be a voluntary donation, and I think many would find it reasonable.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I am only worried about the timeframe. Can we really buy a space within a couple of months? I know that Nadia is planning to go scouting, while I am preparing a list of places where there are interesting lands and farms.

Large groups broken down in smaller ones to increase effectiveness.</p>\n\n<p>It reminded me of the important relationship\xa0between diversity and scale. Each context &amp; group has their\xa0own correlation between diversity and scale, and each situation thus has its own sweet spot(s). Small groups tend to lack diversity, yet they are likely to be efficient\xa0at the few things they do. Large groups tend to follow the opposite rule. Too much diversity in both cases loses functionality. Not enough leads to inbreeding of ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe this has been said already, but I wanted to share it anyway. Your hurdle seems to be very pragmatic, rent and business model, and you\'re looking to start at\xa0a relatively small scale. So I think it might be a good idea to reduce diversity at the start. In other words it might be better to start with people who agree on one business model and leave the door open for diversity as context changes, size grows, opportunities arise. Lean methodology wise.</p>\n\n<p>The potential extra cost of starting in a lean and not-so-diverse way, the potential deficit,\xa0could be considered an investment in all the lessons that you will learn from starting this way. You\xa0could structure this investment as a mortgage or loan to\xa0future users.\xa0They\xa0will be benefiting in hard cash when the model with lots of diversity is ultimately in place, as this model\xa0should be more resilient, economically viable and able to offer lower prices on multiple fronts. It seems natural that dues are paid for what it is built upon. Support from the future community.

We definitely need:</p>\n\n<p>1) people\xa0paying with money in order to meet the\xa0end of the month costs and run it sustainably, but also</p>\n\n<p>2) keep the door open for the severely underfunded people and projects who are aligned in vision, and who could pay in kind.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The offer to these two types of "participants" are different imho. For the first - costs are covered by permanent residents + membership fees and services (! this is where the beef in the thinking is). For the second - costs are covered mostly on a shorter basis, more flexible and\xa0in kind.

Mi piace infatti immaginare che un progetto di alta innovazione sociale come questo, oltre ad incontrare il favore della pubblica amministrazione, possa in qualche modo stimolare l\'interesse del mondo della ricerca (universit\xe0 ed aziende), della finanza etica e dell\'economia solidale oltre che coagulare diversi attori del terzo settore o, pi\xf9 in generale, del no profit indirizzate a questo punto ad una azione di sinergia che possa contribuire \u201cdal basso\u201d al ridisegno di uno stato sociale oggetto di una profonda trasformazione.</p>\n\n<p>Mi auguro che Bruxelles possa costituire un valido banco di prova come Milano possa divenire un secondo nodo di quello che potrebbe divenire un network all\'interno del quale elaborare e trasferire nel concreto il pensiero, l\'approccio ed il consolidamento di OpenCare.</p>\n\n<p>Personalmente, insieme ad altre persone, sto riflettendo e lavorando a WeHandU, una iniziativa volta a supportare le persone nel processo di superamento della loro difficolt\xe0 quotidiana attraverso la realizzazione di una soluzione ottimale per loro stesse e magari per qualcun altro (al momento si pensa al recupero della funzionalit\xe0 della mano e del piede per i soggetti affetti da ictus, sla o lesioni traumatiche), in qualche modo cercando di creare un ambiente di progettazione, lavoro e condivisione della conoscenza che si traduce certamente in uno spazio di co-working e di living lab. Tuttavia questo non esclude, n\xe9 tanto meno preclude, la possibilit\xe0 che tale idea possa evolvere ed articolare in funzione di una maggiore ampiezza delle soluzioni co-progettate quanto piuttosto di una reale apertura a livello transnazionale europeo comportando la strutturazione di spazi e momenti che ne condividano il respiro, le finalit\xe0 e gli obiettivi. Al momento quanto esposto \xe8 infatti oggetto di riflessione tra i membri di WeHandU, per quanto attiene le finalit\xe0 e le possibilit\xe0 realizzative dell\'iniziativa a partire dalla localizzazione delle operativit\xe0 previste (makerspace), ed argomento di informale conversazione telematica tra me, Alberto, Rune ed Alexander.

Testing something like this is right up there with the things we absolutely wanted to try out when setting up our lab. Some initial thoughts, I may be off.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, there\'s two clear levels to this: local collaboration and international collaboration. Both are interesting to research seperately, and the combination even more so.\xa0For good measure, local research groups participating in this are (or should be)\xa0inevitably autonomous in practical aspects. Save the occasional shipping of a sample to replicate experiments\xa0or other small stuff like that. This entails that the local element\xa0will have coordination costs in the form of time, money\xa0and energy\xa0to\xa0keep\xa0the community and project going through a potentially long and tough research track.</p>\n\n<p>The big advantage is that all global groups\xa0are interconnected for the information aspect. The international element\xa0will probably happen relatively smoothly if the right digital infrastructure and practises are in place, as there is a clear incentive to do so: faster learning, collective intelligence. Coordination costs should be low, there\'s only information being shared and this is cheap and fast if you have people who keep track of data.</p>\n\n<p>I\'m optimistic about the uptake of the project by the community here. The main challenge\xa0that I see now for us is the\xa0local coordination cost\xa0(Ghent or Belgium level TBD).\xa0I\'ve (tried to) set up, participated in and observed a few similar\xa0local research collaborations. They all had high coordination costs. This\xa0insight comes from\xa0scientific fields that are way less of a pain than biotech/pharma, so I can\'t see it turning out\xa0easier than expected. Another challenge is\xa0gathering relevant insights in terms of process to have some insights at the end of the road. More so when you haven\'t set it up right at the beginning: having to change process during the project is costly.</p>\n\n<p>For Open Insulin in SF locally it seems\xa0to have turned out well and I already discussed some potential pitfalls with <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/dfko">@dfko</a>. This is very hopeful.</p>\n\n<p>As for international collaboration, there\'s already some stuff in place: filesharing and weekly Skype calls.

For example I remember the story about Rustavi\'s participatory budgeting and Revaz\'s enthusiasm to be involved in implementation. However, there is more to learn about the outcomes of it - for example, in Cluj where I live they ran a 3 step process starting from the neighborhood level. But it involved a lot of deliberation - as Alberto was writing above, that means showing up at neighborhood meetings (physical). They nonetheless got to testing it at the city level, but a lot of the energy got dissipated in sending in <a href="http://cc.yourcluj.ro/index.php/votes/list_initiatives">proposals to compete for online votes\xa0(&gt;400</a>\xa0projects)! and ending up funding very few with little money (1000 eur per winning project - about 50 of them).\xa0 I don\'t want to think of the amount that went into the administration of it, but you see where this goes. That was in 2014-2015, no news since, and more importantly, it\'s unclear whether it was considered successful or not in order to move further in an upgraded version. Anyway, this is just an example.. \xa0hope Rustavi will do much better, but also that people running it are considering risks too.</p>', u'post_id': 726, u'date': u'2017-02-25 15:49:08'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'The limits to participation', u'comment_id': 30886, u'content': u'<p>Thanks for chipping in, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/mariam1313">@mariam1313</a> !\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Like you, I am interested in participation. My own work has been about ways that the Internet can enable more effective forms of participatory democracy. I even wrote <a href="http://www.cottica.net/wikicrazia/">a book</a> about this. My point of departure was that participation as we inherited it from the 20th has not made a substantial impact on decision quality or societal cohesion, at least not in Italy, not even in the best cases. There are many reasons why this happens. Some of them:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Participatory processes are designed by civil servants, with other civil servants and "usual suspect" stakeholders</strong> (like professional business and trade union representatives)\xa0<strong>in mind</strong>. In your rural development example, I see that they worked through offline meetings, convened in cities and on weekdays at 11.00 am. That choice is going to prevent the most interesting potential participants (the local entrepreneur, the teacher, the parent of small children...) from showing up. People who reliably do show up are the people paid to participate, like representatives and lobbyists... but those already have channels to talk to the government. The other option would be to convene during the evenings, but, at least in Italy, civil servants do not like this at all. The option is almost never even discussed. So, most of the collective brainpower is ruled out before the process even starts.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>The "technology of participation" (the town hall meeting) is non-scalable</strong>. This means (a) every participant\xa0will spend most of her\xa0time being talked to and (b) people will need to keep any intervention short. This means there is no time to explore issues and scenarios. This is why I like so much online forums like Edgeryders: you can participate in your own time (when you are off work, when your children are asleep...); take time to make your case; and no one is forced to be reading anyone else. We\xa0<em>choose</em>\xa0to engage with contributions we find interesting.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>The social contract underpinning participation is often not clear.</strong> I participate, then what? What we suggest gets implemented? What we suggest gets considered? How do I know decisions have not been made beforehands, and the decision maker ris just looking for a rubberstamp? Recent example: after an online and offline consultation with 1.8\xa0<em>million</em>\xa0participants on Italian schools, number 1 request that emerged was to have teachers evaluated by independent experts, and not by their own headmasters. The government, nevertheless, decided to reject that request. Assuming the average participants spent two hours participating (very conservative assumption), that means the waste of 3.6 million hours. In European standards (1,732 productive hours in a year), that the equivalent of about\xa02,000 years of human work. Not cool. The social contract issue is the easiest one to fix.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have recently been involved in contributing to Italy\'s 3rd action plan under the Open Government Partnership (as an activist, unpaid). My brothers-and-sisters-in-arms and myself made these points quite forcefully, and they have been adopted by the government. Here\'s to hoping for better times. <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 726, u'date': u'2017-02-22 11:45:33'}, {u'user_id': 3496, u'title': u'Undisclosed content ', u'comment_id': 30612, u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 726, u'date': u'2017-02-22 09:28:00'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'A new point of view perhaps?', u'comment_id': 30497, u'content': u'<p>Hi everyone, this is to introduce <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/mariam1313">@mariam1313</a> and also draw her attention to this conversation.

The political process (and media) focus on high-level strategies, but the greatest impact reforms would come from reforming the govt\'s operating system: quite simply, the affordances of people therein. Example: my sister works for an Italian municipality called Modena. In a drive to contain costs, some genius passed an internal regulation that employees travelling on business ("missions", as they are known in the public sector) need an authorization from the highest political level (<em>giunta</em>\xa0in Italian, which means the mayor and her close collaborators). This is such a hassle that in 99.9% of the cases managers renounce. Employees do not get to go to conferences. As a result, over time the whole workforce becomes isolated and its skillset depreciates and withers.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Changing this does not require a strategy. A workforce that stays up to date would help any mayor, be she conservative or progressive. It does not require changing the law, either. The city council could simply vote a resolution allocating a modest budget that each employee can use to go to conferences and events they are interested in. This would have a massive impact, in my opinion. Maybe <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/franca">@Franca</a> has an idea of how these decisions are made (or, in the case of Modena, not made).\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 726, u'date': u'2017-01-01 13:57:54'}, {u'user_id': 3362, u'title': u'Great', u'comment_id': 30318, u'content': u'<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/franca">@Franca</a> I think having this conversation is a great first step. It\'s going to be a very complex problem to solve. Its tentacles go so far into other domains that are even more fundamental to our society.</p>\n\n<p>When we\xa0set out to solve a complex problem in our organisation, we\xa0start with small actions that change the context a little. Small experiments that can fail, but the lessons of which can scale big. A great example in government is a challenge this month of my own city where they will distribute 1,300,000 euros among civilian projects that aim to have a positive impact on the city. Citizen vote will account for 70% in the decision where the money goes. I don\'t think popularity contests are the best way to do this either, but it\'s a beginning and will change the playing field.</p>\n\n<p>Yet this is already at the interface with the public, at the policy level. Most\xa0possible small experiments I can think of\xa0would all very likely fail at another point: the government itself. The\xa0processes, people, time perception, incentive structures, ... Seperately these things\xa0are not huge problems, but together they form a problem where there are little starting points to start solving it. I\'d say the most important problem for\xa0the government to solve today, is the government itself, not the policies\xa0it produces.

The city is being quite proactive: in one neighborhood it might encourage activities that interest young people, in another the focus might be on migrants etc. (see <a href="http://www.comune.milano.it/wps/portal/ist/it/servizi/casa/chi_cerca_uno_spazio/assegnazione_su_progetto">here</a>, in Italian). It\'s the same thing you are doing at VDH, Yannick, but on a much larger scale.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I, for one, am very interested in having a discussion on policy with you guys. I would be more than willing to reach out to other policy makers too. What do you think?</p>', u'post_id': 726, u'date': u'2016-12-07 22:01:36'}, {u'user_id': 3293, u'title': u'Great to read this :)', u'comment_id': 29073, u'content': u'<p>Hey <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/franca">@Franca</a> and <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/winnieponcelet">@WinniePoncelet</a> thanks for these comments.</p>\n\n<p>What you wrote Franca is really great to read, because it is the first time actually having a policy maker understanding so well the principle of an open care system, but also discribing the role a governement has to play in the futur. He is there as a facilitator, giving the right tools to test and later on help scale the bottom up initiatives. In such way the governement becomes a currator, not simply a gatekeeper of the funds, but the person who helps grow the talented projects.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Winnie i know what you are discribing, with my years of activism i had\xa0mostly the same kind of experience \xa0with policy makers in Brussels. Getting funds is tricky because you need to behave a certain way because \'they\' have the power in hand, you have to calculate who is going to get the portefieulle in next couple of years and so on.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>But a couple of days ago a kind of epiphany came accross. In fact like what edgeryders does on care, we can create locally on any topic, creating an easy swarm of projects that can become a lever to not wait till policy is written, but to shape what it is going to be without having to play the political game. We are going to do this exercice with the Brussels makers scene through the FabCity platform of Barcelona. Bringing projects towards organisations and spaces and coordinating these spaces to communicate as one about their needs towards politics. In such way that we don\'t have the proposal from politics: let\'s just build 170 fablabs for 2020, but that through the swarm of knowledge know what are really the necesities.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Hope i could contribute to this nice debate;</p>', u'post_id': 726, u'date': u'2016-12-05 15:01:49'}, {u'user_id': 3362, u'title': u'"We\u2019are thinking to develop this idea: became an ', u'comment_id': 28966, u'content': u'<p>"We\u2019are thinking to develop this idea: became an enabling platform that can facilitate the dissemination of some solutions, and create the conditions to replicate in a large scale what has been evaluated effective."</p>\n\n<p>From the perspective of our organisation, this is exactly what we need. We follow this strategy internally in our organisation as well: test lots of things in a small cheap way, evaluate,\xa0scale, evaluate and so on. In my city this is done sometimes, like with the <a href="http://www.leefstraat.be/en/">Living Streets</a>\xa0project. The city was cooperative enough to let them test the idea. These are exceptions sadly.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve been to a few city organised or backed \'workshops\' meant to shape the future of the city. The workshops\xa0all lack\xa0the same: citizens present. Generally, they\xa0are organised during working hours and the only participants are civil servants and companies/entrepreneurs that have an economic\xa0stake in the issue. The details of how these workshops go, are pathetic. And it\'s packaged and sold to the citizens as \'co-creation\'. Last one was most striking. A workshop on urban planning,\xa0commissioned by the city and organised by the same organisations that were involved in an ongoing massive real estate scandal. The workshop itself featured only entrepreneurs and project developers, talking about matters that affect everyone.\xa0Already at this basic level, the city fails. How can anything good come from such a basis?</p>\n\n<p>Maybe this is how at least a little good can come from it. Our city has an image of being progressive and there are lots of projects that prove this. In the end however, politicians mainly want to get re-elected or get a better position next term. This means they need to live up to public expectations and produce impact in the short term. The fact that people here expect politicians to be more progressive, means the politician\'s\xa0output will have to be\xa0more progressive in order to make a career. As a result we have a pretty awesome city.\xa0However,\xa0it\'s a sugary coating that\xa0hides the broken way in\xa0which we are governed.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve been advised by a project coordinator to stay away from help from the city. She described it like this: if we were to receive support from the educational department under politician x from party a, next term all support could be gone under politician y\xa0from party b. Because politician y needs to have their own projects for their curriculum, so the limited means need to go towards launching new initiatives from scratch under their term. Also, draining a project from a political opponent diminishes that opponent\'s credibility. This is such a waste on so many levels: money, knowledge, time, ... Not to mention the competitive atmosphere this actually creates between projects that otherwise share a similar purpose.</p>\n\n<p>My own experience:\xa0I contacted the city anyway a few months back. I mailed with the responsible politician and she directed me to the civil servant at the bottom of the \'food chain\'. We met, she was impressed by our project and clearly wanted to help. She promised me to take the message back up the food chain, but assured me it would take a while, and keep me updated along the way. The department got restructured, so this was slowing things down.\xa0Fast forward 2 months, no news, and our project is already in a different stage. Time flows differently for the government,\xa0I hope people\xa0age\xa0slower as a perk for working there.</p>\n\n<p>A government\xa0platform for projects to grow at their own speed would be a major improvement.

The ethical suffering can occur in any organization where it is required to do things that are too far from what actual work should look like in the eyes of the concerned people who are passionated about what they do.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve observed such situations in not for profit AND in for profit organizations even though the purpose and the values behind the organization were sensefull for people. It is about the meaning of the work to be done and the way it is asked.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed <strong>distributed decision making processes\xa0</strong>(cf the integrative decision making process), <strong>spaces where people can share practices in order to improve them</strong> (which supposes that they have an influence on them),\xa0<strong>the autonomy of each team and individual in his/her area of competence and responsibility</strong>\xa0(where each person\xa0is sometimes leader\xa0and sometimes follower)\xa0combined with a <strong>results-oriented work process</strong> (instead of an effort-oriented culture giving more credit on hours spent then on results) are cornerstones\xa0to move forward in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p>What is meant by heath at work ?

Government is mainly seen as an obstacle at this point.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom-up initiatives follow the same reasoning to a large extent. Government is one of the obstacles to be overcome, because they're perceived as ingerently part of the problem, almost an external factor that is unchangeable. But they have to do it\xa0with less means,\xa0less people and less power (leading to the burnout problem).\xa0Additionally, the whole neo-liberal side\xa0will see these projects and initiators as 'one of them', because of the shared 'entrepreneurial activism'. For an outsider, the difference between both fades.</p>\n\n<p>One of their conclusions was that there is a\xa0need for political activism by these bottom-up activists right now, rather than only acting boots on the ground.

Stress often comes from a conflict of values between prescribed work and "real" work, "real" in the sense of\xa0what really has to be done in a correct way.</p>\n\n<p>A large amount of professionals who get burnt out couldn\'t live anymore with the contradiction between what is asked and what should really be done.

Just the tension between what is asked and what true professionals believe should be done (eg : social workers in big institutions, engineers in industrial companies, nurses in hospitals,...).

Heard of a scheme in Wakefield the other day, where triage is used between various branches of care (hospital, local GP / nurses, local or community facilities such as care homes) which was proving very effective at managing need and ensuring "efficient" (for want of a better word) addressing of peoples\' needs. (Some volunteer services, such as Help the Aged and the like were involved to help with transport and checking on a patient when they were ready to go home, rather than them waiting for ambulance services and staff from\xa0social care services to check on their immediate needs once back - but this did seem better than the individual concerned waiting unnecessarily in hospital, at huge cost.)</p>\n\n<p>Another benefit found was that building such local links ensured the elderly were "monitored" as in an eye was kept on their health and quality of life, and people could be referred to locally available facilities that they may not have been aware of or may have been reluctant to request or attend.</p>\n\n<p>Definitely think the time is ripe for new approaches, and also that a new willingness to try these is developing on the part of CCGs, healthcare trusts and local councils. Hopefully this will extend to national government, and they will allow local solutions to develop from the ground up. They are doing so in other health sectors, so there is hope.

It seems people in such projects envisage sharing a carer as they get to the point of needing help. I\'m not sure of the viability of staying in such a place when serious dementia\xa0 or physical ailments start to occur; equally regular medication may require a qualified nurse and preventative care may require qualified staff on hand 24/7.</p>\n\n<p>Again, I do think we need to start thinking about things in terms of the housing we are building. We can\'t just keep building homes for young families or "trendy" flats for young single people. We need to seriously consider social housing, mixed communities, purpose-built homes for the elderly, etc. Mixed housing should be mandatory for large-scale new build schemes, and not just a tiny number of "affordable flats" that the developer can negotiate to build in a completely different city (as is happening now in the UK!). Also social attitudes and culture need to move on; young people and families need to see a mixed community as an asset, that can bring wisdom and care for their own children within easy reach, rather than seeing it as something they wouldn\'t really be interested in.</p>\n\n<p>I\'d listen to my previous post above on the actual issues of budgets, who pays for what when interacting with the powers-that-be, etc. What I can say from these initial cohousing projects is that they\'re a start, but don\'t yet seem to consider serious (legally covered) nursing care.</p>\n\n<p>(Are you aware of companies like McCarthy and Stone who build retirement homes, by the way? Perhaps schemes like that could be a way to progress the idea of cohousing and start people living together, with care facilities and good environments provided on top of their existing model.)</p>\n\n<p>(Final thought - have done some volunteer work in a day care centre for adults with learning difficulties before... Perhaps a similar model, with day facilities and night care facilities built separately, or being more intermingled than just nursing home residents gathered in their particular nursing homes 24/7, would be a good idea. Those who were more capable could use cooking facilities, make and create, etc. whilst in their "day environment," and other age groups or people living in the local area could also come and use such facilities / interact / assist? Again, funding would be an issue, especially in our current environment of service cuts and the loss of community centres and other such facilities. However, in the long run, I do think such things could prove to save money by keeping people active and involved. (Been reading something else today on the fact that inadequate checks on the elderly costs the NHS \xa32bn per annum due to resultant falls! So even a weekly visit to a local centre, or some interaction / activity, could prevent such things and incorporate some very simple checks - asking how they are balance-wise, quick check on visual acuity...)</p>\n\n<p>Again - the major issue is the fact that we don\'t have joined up thinking, but increasing fragmentation in health and social care. Each individual element is asked to cut costs and reduce facilities, even if that results in massive costs elsewhere...</p>\n\n<p>I better stop at this point, or I\'ll get political again <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>Very happy to converse more on this area / subject of health, care for the elderly, cohousing, mixed housing, etc. <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/winnieponcelet">@WinniePoncelet</a> ,\xa0\xa0<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/rossana_torri"><span class="mention">@Rossana</span> Torri</a>\xa0,\xa0<a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/lakomaa">@Lakomaa</a> <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/yannick">@Yannick</a> ,\xa0\xa0and\xa0<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/winnieponcelet"></a><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/alberto">@Alberto</a>\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Have copied some links on cohousing in the post below...</p>', u'post_id': 758, u'date': u'2017-02-03 22:59:31'}, {u'user_id': 3545, u'title': u'Care Homes - The Bottom Line', u'comment_id': 29077, u'content': u'<p>For those in the UK, this programme was excellent!

Meeting the cost is a big debate here, especially in a time of "austerity" and widescale removal of central government funding.</p>\n\n<p>There is good reason for the regulatory framework, but the overhead for both\xa0parties (regulatory body and care institution) has become increasingly high and ever-changing, as with many top-down bureaucratic systems. (In the UK the body has gone through some changes after criticism regarding its efficacy , but it was formed from good intentions to stop care providers simply taking the money and "housing" the elderly or needy. There have been issues with maltreatment, theft, poor care, etc., just as there has in other social care areas, so some standards need to be set and monitoring carried out by a third party.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the issue is funding. Larger premises or chains do lead to economies of scale and can help with staffing (whereas a single, small institution may need to resort to agency staff on occasion - which can be very expensive). The other side of this is that large operators can seem\xa0to get away with things that a small or single premises operator would not, simply as to rebuke them or suspend their activities would result in chaos for service users, never mind the relationships that develop with a large care provider and a local council or\xa0clinical commissioning group. (I\'ve seen examples of large corporates who provide home care services being inspected and noises being made by staff who complain they are not alloted time to travel between appointments, etc., yet nothing seems to be done, despite the obvious failings. I suspect some in\xa0Government aren\'t in a position or of a mind to focus on the service users at the moment, but rather see some dubious measures\xa0as essential cost-cutting / profit maximisation on the part of the corporate body. Another point to bear in mind is the connections between certain politicians, financiers, and industry - as with many sectors!)</p>\n\n<p>What I have seen from my exposure to a small institution is caring staff who are doing a good job and have good, close relationships with their service users. However, they are often distracted or overwhelmed by\xa0an ever-changing regulatory framework, as happens in other sectors such as teaching. Ultimately I would like to see the funding from lcoal councils topped up by central government, and this be accepted as the only way to provide decent care. More flexibility from the regulatory body would also help - allowing for more differences in care provision, especially in smaller, more intimate homes; as I\'ve mentioned this does seem to be unlikely given the current standardised, bureaucratic, regulation and\xa0inspection by\xa0checklist...</p>\n\n<p>(Equally mixed communities and inter-generational interaction would help, but this is increasingly rare. Housing seems to be led by developers keen to focus on young families who have income to buy new-builds on new estates, and marketing focuses on the younger age groups that go\xa0our and spend their disposable income, hence society focuses around such people. What would help is a societal background that valued the more elderly or mature, for their experience, wisdom and human stories.)</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps a graduated move towards care premises would be good, whereby a suitable\xa0one could be found in the local community and the potential resident spends some time there to build connections and tie them to existing links in the community outside, rather than that person going through an instant switch involving the sale of their own house and them being suddenly moved in to a care premises. Ideally, children and other family would be near enough to visit and spend time there too, but again we need societal change in this area. We seem to be more keen on housing our elderly relatives in care homes in the UK than say, South East Asia or Southern Europe. More interaction should be encouraged. (I\'ve seen some families who barely see their parents once they\'ve been moved in to a care home!)</p>\n\n<p>I do feel interaction with local community institutions would also help - retaining an existing GP, interacting with local schools and even nurseries, community gardens, parks and the like - though obviously this would depend on the mental and physical fitness of the person concerned. Fundamentally we still see care homes as a last resort, rather than a good place to be, and a large part of that is due to the lack of community interaction. I see some sheltered or assisted housing, where there are good communal facilities and assistance available if needed, but the person is otherwise living in their own flat or rooms... Such premises could be combined with a more typical care home, so there is a mix of people within the institution, though this could present issues handling medical needs.</p>\n\n<p>Sizes of residential housing is also an issue. Many people now buy new-build houses with small rooms and little extra space compared to older homes, hence there isn\'t always the capacity to bring in an elderly relative. Again this comes back to the issue of housebuilding, supply and demand, selling off of social housing, developers maximising profits by building small homes on greenfield sites whilst ignoring the many brownfield sites or old, disused homes that could be brought up to standard... Nothing in this world is disconnected! <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>To return to the main points - I do think small care institutions can bring advantages, good personal care and rewarding relationships, but we do need to look at funding in this country. We also need to look at how we consider and treat the elderly in this country. These are big issues, but it is a matter of priority. I don\'t wish to turn this in to a political comment, but the current thinking seems to be aimed at small government, austerity and cutting services and council funding. Sooner or later we will have to accept more taxes if we want good social services.</p>\n\n<p>I do like the ideas initially expressed at the top of this thread, but it would seem to get these accepted and off-the-ground one would have to push for acceptance from the council, government or regulatory body concerned. I am sure there would be interest in alternative care provision, given the struggles in the sector at the moment, and I\'m sure families of those needing care would be interested in such alternatives too.</p>', u'post_id': 758, u'date': u'2017-02-01 09:00:09'}, {u'user_id': 104, u'title': u'First do no harm...', u'comment_id': 27642, u'content': u'<p>Thanks Zazie, I appreciate your note of caution.

It seems to me there is an "upstream" problem: finding the money to take a valuable piece of real estate off the market forever, damn the capital gain. I don\'t see how this can be completely solved. The advantage of the CLT model is that you only have to do that ONCE. Once you have done it, the land is secure (except if the CLT goes bust, but I imagine CLTs are supposed to be very risk-averse).

This is partly because we are a small crowded island and could do with more houses but it is also because we have an excess of money, and it tends to accumulate in the hands of a minority.</p>\n\n<p>In care, the result is that individuals and even the state find it increasingly hard to acquire care homes and they attract private equity and hedge funds who treat staff as human "resources" and patients as "consumers" of health care services, squeezing the system to extract wealth.</p>\n\n<p>This is, arguably, an extreme way of presenting the situation (after all, even hedge funds have to employ managers, many of whom are very professional and caring). However the fact is that having "owners" who have different drivers and values from the care-givers causes a tension that too often results in quality of care taking second place to "delivery of health services", which is quite a different thing.</p>\n\n<p>A useful parallel is the struggle many communities have to create affordable housing. An interesting and succesful innovation has been the community land trust, where land is acquired by or on behalf of the community and held in trust over the long term. They make the land available for affordable housing. Separating out the ownership of the land from the occupation of the land allows people who couldn\'t otherwise afford to occupy the land to come in and use it, subject to the conditions set down by the trust. We imagine a similar type of structure.</p>\n\n<p>To put it another way, using financial language, owning land has a different time horizon and a different risk profile\xa0 from owning a business. A care home that separates the two can attract different sorts of capital for the two different needs, and thus more closely match the interests of the investors with the interests of the stakeholders.

Or seeing instability with/ without a medical diagnosis and not knowing what to do to be somehow useful? Because mental illness manifested in everyday lives, \xa0outside hospital premises goes unacknowledged to a too great extent by our communities (maybe Ireland is more sensitive to this..), I imagine and even witnessed it once that the tendency is avoidance or not dealing \xa0with it. If you\'re not a close friend or relative of someone fighting this, the simplest may be to walk away.. Which is a pity because you are part of the same community, and the more support is made available the better all our lives. At least this is on my mind right now.

I have a rich medical history and although I had a brief run in with acupuncture, I never really went for it. I\'d still like try it out\xa0when the opportunity presents itself.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s an interesting remark on the authority of health practitioners <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/steelweaver">@steelweaver</a> and <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> . I think the reliance on\xa0guidance by an expert\xa0is in large part\xa0the result of the patients\xa0not being as familiar with acupuncture\xa0as the expert. Yet patients\xa0are there for a reason: at some level, they believe in\xa0the positive potential of the treatment. This common\xa0belief of both parties is the base for authority and\xa0lends you, or the practitioner, as an expert the authority to give direction. Authority governs the interaction and when nobody (or nothing) assumes it, confusion arises. To be clear:\xa0authority is different from power.</p>\n\n<p>I can complement this with my personal experience in the standard healthcare system in Belgium. For a little over 5 years I had a series of serious physical afflictions, which didn\'t ever seem to heal or resolve themselves and only got worse over the years. At the start I always\xa0left the clinic with a smile, which\xa0always disappeared in days, weeks or months as the situation deteriorated again. I experienced first hand that I was just\xa0a number, and that treating symptoms is faster and\xa0easier. Good thing for pharma companies, because endlessly treating symptoms sells more drugs.\xa0Finding the real cause takes longer, is harder and is more expensive, at least in the short term.</p>\n\n<p>I got pretty skeptical about the system by going from doctor to doctor and spending more time in physiotherapy than with my friends or family. Gradually I lost belief in the system. It was\xa0after I ultimately found the cause and cure (very simple ones at that) that whatever remained\xa0of my belief vanished.\xa0With that\xa0gone, there was no more common belief between me and the doctor, so the authority vanished. My language can\'t hide\xa0it: I found the\xa0solution, not a doctor or a system.\xa0For this specific\xa0illness, I will not lend authority very easily anymore either.\xa0I\'m lucky, as I have a general idea of healthcare through my studies\xa0and know my body well by now, but this is clearly problematic for the general population when you hear similar stories with unhappy endings.</p>\n\n<p>Also interesting that (at least for me) a big part of the authority of the health practitioner is due to belief in the system, rather than a belief in the knowledge of the doctor (which I never really doubted).\xa0I think that might be a western thing, linked to what\xa0surfaced in the discussions with <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/alkasem23">@alkasem23</a> about <a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/how-cultural-differences-can-make-us-understand-our-flaws-in-the-care-sector-better/757">differences in care with Syria</a>:\xa0in the west we put our trust in and rely on systems rather than other people. In some\xa0other cultures,\xa0people probably put their belief mainly in a person, the doctor.</p>\n\n<p>Easier interactions through\xa0the internet,\xa0powerful search engines,\xa0a lot of people sharing experience and stories online, easy access to second opinions (in my country anyway)... Though they don\'t\xa0always provide\xa0correct information, these factors also\xa0lead people to challenge the authority in terms of knowledge\xa0of the practitioner in the classical doctor\'s office. I\xa0think both this challenging of knowledge and the failure of the system will inevitably lead to some fundamental changes in healthcare.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, authority cannot simply disappear, the common belief has to shift to something else. Most stories of\xa0experimentation with new methods in the stories here on Edgeryders\xa0share some sort of\xa0community aspect. This\xa0illustrates a shift to lending authority to a\xa0collective rather than a system or a person. The\xa0collective can consist\xa0of patients, doctors or other caregivers and is likely\xa0a mixture ideally. In Syria the collective is mainly the family, according to Alkasem.</p>\n\n<p>Looking through this lens\xa0of authority\xa0is interesting and can be applied to many aspects of our\xa0daily lives.\xa0The matter is fresh in my head from <a href="http://paulverhaeghe.psychoanalysis.be/boeken.html">a Dutch book</a> I just finished reading, which I hope\xa0gets translated\xa0to English.

For the younger generation who may have not had the presence of grandparents or the presence of older generations creating an influence in their life this is an added value for them, it connects the past, present and future in one conversation.

There is a lot of talk to help older people, but perhaps they can help the young. It\'s the experiences of life in a multigenerational, interdependent, abstract community that, more than anything else, teaches us how to be human. The older generation often is faced with isolation- which in turn creates the backdrop for cognitive decline. We all know that. If we can improve the standing of older adults in society, and nurture what they can bring through to the table, then we can achieve a better community with a better quality of life for all ages.

The list you see at the post it was only for the open calls. I prefered\xa0 to keep it simple so the people could bring things from home as soon as possible. And something else important! Not asking questions! Most of the backpacks included more items and many of them prepared for adults so the list was different. When you gather things for the crowd it\'s more complicate than it seems. The people want to help but very often the misunderstand\xa0 the announcements and they want to ask for details. About months I was on line (every line!) nearly 24h. For example they could understand why we asked for plastic crocs style (I avoided the word "crocs" and use the word "clogs" because many people thought I\'m trying to advertise them). Especially for this, a woman from a "...welcome" team laught at me and insult me in public. She told me that these type is useless when crossing the european rivers and she refused to share the posts if i didn\'t ask for rain boots or athletic shoes. I wasted (or maybe not) about an hour to explain that this type of shoes are chosen because: it\'s easy to use them when you want to go to the bathroom at night, to wash your feet, to rest for a while when you have only one pair of shoes for walking, the are light weight, you can hang them out of the backpack, they are cheap e.t.c.

Thanks a lot for being there for everyone though!</p>\n\n<p>Let me think out loud about the list a little.</p>\n\n<p>You need to give a lot of information in very little time. It is important that it can be understood quickly. It is also important that people understand why some things are better than other things. Here is what I would try:</p>\n\n<p>Try to use a combination of images and text, a little like a meme. The image is most important (says more than 1000 words) and will ideally explain most of the things that have been discussed in many hours before. Ideally the people who are really deep into the topic do a thorough image search and you pool them together, and then photoshop or redraw. Of course one image (even if it is very good) can\'t explain everything, that is why you need a little text (english, greek, arabic probably).

You may want to have one page for as a sort of inventory and one page as a sort of manual (e.g. there is <a href="https://youtu.be/dOAD5nr4IgM?t=416" rel="nofollow noopener">a lot</a> you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5E2rjakS60" rel="nofollow noopener">can do</a> with the <a href="http://seattlebackpackersmagazine.com/50-uses-for-an-emergency-blanket/" rel="nofollow noopener">space blanket</a> that needs <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/22%C2%BD-uses-for-emergency-mylar-space-blankets-03242014" rel="nofollow noopener">a little extra info</a> (maybe Lizzie could also check the list?)).</p>\n\n<p>Some more things I thought of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It is much easier to get kids to wash their hands while they play with something. Small pebbles or pearls also rub the hands so they get cleaned much better. Kids are big bacteria spreaders. More on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25C768kkK4" rel="nofollow noopener">hygiene</a>. You can make a sink with the space blanket and duct tape, or an old plastic ice cream package (1L weighs 30g).</p></li>\n<li><p>for washing clothes you can use the space blanket.</p></li>\n<li><p>I would recommend 3 (ziplock?) plastic bags with sugar (perhaps with stevia - more weight efficient), salt, and a piece of soap. One bag big enough for <a href="http://thenaturalpenguin.com/2015/11/how-to-make-an-alternative-hot-water-bottle/" rel="nofollow noopener">this hot water "bottle"</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV2gsWHhDhY" rel="nofollow noopener">Heating</a> or use hot rock or sand.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.briggscorp.com%2Fimg_catalog%2F16_909_Lr.jpg&amp;f=1" rel="nofollow noopener">sterile saline solution</a> (smallest possible), if you need more desinfected water, you can also boil</p></li>\n<li><p>a comb (or just half)</p></li>\n<li><p>vasiline (part for real use, but more for "magic cream" placebo effect)</p></li>\n<li><p>kids earplugs (use alcohol to desinfect!), probably smart to tie in a piece of string for safety.</p></li>\n<li><p>antiseptic wipes (can be "refilled" with alcohol)</p></li>\n<li><p>in terms of clothes I would try to reduce cotton.

So what I\'d think is crucial is the presentation format and delivery method.</p>\n\n<p>For example after a catastrophy (or on the march) very few people will have the time to read about it in Red Cross or USAid pdfs even though they would probably remember critical things much better than in a classroom. Some can understand scientific papers, and others cannot read. Generally, if you want to be prepared you need to invest some time into practicing or reading e.g. "Where there is no Doctor", or stocking some tools or supplies before shit hits the fan. Not many people are ready to do that. It is much less glamorous than posing with big guns and other stuff. Often people (correctly) feel it is unlikely that they would get a return on investment for their effort. Also, crises affect different regions (e.g. climate) in different ways, in those regions e.g. urban areas will be affected differently from rural, in those places <a href="http://thesurvivalmom.com/prepping-type-1-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener">different people</a> (age, occupation, gender, minority) will again be affected differently in short to long term.</p>\n\n<p>Most documents I know are written in a linear fashion, either for "the general populace" or authorities, or a few select critcal professions. Research articles in the field are often a bit better (if you can get them and understand them) as they show more of the detail under the hood. There is quite a bit out there in English, <a href="https://www.bbk.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/BBK/DE/Publikationen/Broschueren_Flyer/Buergerinformationen_A4/Ratgeber_Brosch.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">German</a>, and I am sure French language. I would expect that other languages can be a very mixed bag.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly almost none of the materials I know are intended for reproduction and dissemination (perhaps modification) in the field, which I think is a critical shortcoming. Economically you often cannot but be largely unprepared for low frequency large impact events. If you could could start quickly copy-pasting stuff from a relatively few seeds once the event has come to pass, you would very quickly be able to deliver information and organize action far better.</p>\n\n<p>I think the most realistic forms of reproduction in the field are (including grid down, excluding perhaps nuclear EMP scenarios):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Copies via smart phone, either onto micro-sd card or using e.g. bluetooth file transfer.</p></li>\n<li><p>Recording of spoken/played material via phone, perhaps eventually put into writing.</p></li>\n<li><p>Pencil/coal stick/copy machine copies of simple illustrations/heuristics/nmemonics/ not more than a few lines in most cases.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My suggestion would be a less linear and mostly digital collection of material (even if the grid will be down it will be relatively easy to charge a smartphone/tablet/etc from solar or car batteries). Ideally most of it can be accessed through different lenses - weighing urgent vs important, for the specific "type" of audience, in a (or several) appropriate formats. On the latter point I would strongly recommend inlcuding something that is audio based with separate illustrations (and check lists, e.g. in playing card deck, or digitally as "album art" format) and incremental navigation (e.g. if you need to know more on this topic press forward 9 times and you hear the announcement "xyz"). An audio lecture then could be made up of a summary of 1. the most important things to know in a hurry, 2. the main content, 3. mnemonic take aways to repeat to yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Audio has the advantages that you do not need to drop everything you\'re doing, you can do it while walking, and you can do it in the dark.</p>\n\n<p>If you use 64kbps (clear spoken language) mono mp3 audio you need approximately 1 MB for every 2 minutes. If we assume 24h of spoken material that would be 720 MB. This fits into almost every memory card (or CD), mp3 player and can be copied using bluetooth version 3 in 5 minutes, and version 2 in 30 minutes. The most important things everyone needs to know should probably be available in different languages but be only 3-15 minutes in duration. Additional material can be provided in ebook format (which can be referenced in the audio) with very little space required.</p>\n\n<p>My schematic in the other comment is an example for non-digital content that can also be reproduced in the field, when you actually have demand. It could also be airdropped as leaflets of course.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to make a heuristic approach to re-establish some skeletal form of organization which can catalyze coopreration (especially in the 48h hours of pro-social behavior mostly observed after an acute catastrophe). I thought this is necessary because very often there exists no effective interface to the local society that the "professional care &amp; aid circus" can dock into, and many of the respective group\'s fuck-ups would be easier to avoid if there was such an interface. The idea is to establish channels on the ground within the local community which accumulate, curate (discuss), and disseminate critical information. Those information dense hubs can relatively easily be found and interfaced with the professionals. If the crises do not have a clear onset like an earthquale or flood, but is more creeping other approaches may be more effective though.</p>\n\n<p>The implied understanding that may motivate people is the following: Doing difficult situations alone is usually not a good idea*. Put 20% into helping each other, and if the majority survives you\'ll probably be among them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The simplified instructions: 1 of 5 connects and helps to coordinate. 1 in 5 helps to coordinate coordinators. Information must flow in both directions fast, and critical aspects need to be documented.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Make a group in which you will quickly be able to trust, care, and communicate (so about 5). Then make groups of groups and dedicate 10-20% of your resources to communication &amp; cooperation, about half "upwards" and half "downwards".</p>\n\n<p>*Something that rarely gets enough attention when you superficially glance at the prepper scene. Alone you are probably prey to your own stupidity, germs, or pack hunters.

Babs\xa0immediately knew who I meant. She said that there were not many beggars and homeless people\xa0in Savannakhet, a city of 120,000 people and second largest city\xa0in Laos. There used to be many people asking for money on the streets a few years earlier.\xa0Most of them came from large, poor\xa0families outside the city. One or two family members would go to the city to beg and send some money back home. Recently, the local government chased those people away back to the rural areas.</p>\n\n<p>The\xa0reasoning was\xa0that the families\xa0were able to sustain themselves growing crops on their small piece of land, so they should not come begging in the city. Responsibility to take care of each other rests\xa0on\xa0the family. This is the situation for most of the Lao: they can sustain themselves but they have almost nothing more and live in poverty. Begging in the city is one of the ways out.</p>\n\n<p>Babs said that now, there only remain a few homeless people\xa0who have mental or physical disabilities and no family to rely on. In other words, those who have no other options. The police condones them and they are usually helped by the community, like getting food from food vendors.</p>\n\n<p>Babs mentioned that there were plenty of mentally and physically disabled people\xa0due to a poor medical system, pointing out especially the issue of giving birth in rural areas.

This could be fundamental to the opencare vision.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>We propose that communities are good candidates for being caregivers, because they are fair (they share the burden across individuals), efficient (allocation of who takes care of whom is based on self-selection: low overhead, you give care when and where you are readiest/most motivated to do so, receive it in the time and domain of your greatest need), and retain a human touch that state-and private sector provided care cannot (you care for your own, etc.). This is predicated on\xa0the givers and receivers of care recognizing each other as one: everyone is part of the same "we". When a person is recognized as\xa0<em>not\xa0</em>part of the "we", the community\'s incentive to care for her fails.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>And it would be unwise to put it down to human error or happenstance.\xa0Some scientists argue convingly that for humans to divide between "us" and "them"\xa0is innate, because in our hunter-gatherer past we evolved under selection pressure at the group level. A full argument is made by E.O. Wilson in <a href="http://longnow.org/seminars/02012/apr/20/social-conquest-earth/">The Social Conquest of Earth</a>.

From what i can gather, their experiences growing up straight after WW2 in a culture that still had lots of echoes of the wartime propaganda left an indelible mark on their attitudes to the outsider.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I grew up in a multi-ethnic society, with children from multiple places around the globe. To me, there is no fear or mistrust in seeing people from other ethnic backgrounds around me. But for my grandparents, there is a lingering Nationalism, a lack of acceptance of \'otherness\' - socially, sexually, racially. Brought up in the social strictures of oost-war Britain they reject the social liberalisation that they have lived through. One could argue that they didn\'t really get to experience the full force of the social liberalisation. Many married young and had children young, many women stayed as full-time child carers and had little interaction outside of the home. Many had large families in the models of their parents before them. Their children have experienced the social liberalisation fully (sexual revolution, oral contraceptives, relaxation of the divorce laws), they grew up with a few non-white faces around them because of Windrush (immigration to UK from newly Independent West Indies) or from Indian sub-continental immigration before and after Partition. Their children (my parent\'s generation) were also the first people to truely benefit from the way that membership of the EU opened up travel around Europe and the North African coastline. They experienced the realities of live in other countries and these experiences changed how they think. My grandmother has never been outside the UK in her entire life.</p>\n\n<p>Now, at the point when she is starting to struggle with self care (and here i definitely agree with <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/johncoate">@johncoate</a> \'s view that there is a stubborness and irrational sense of personal independence in their generation) more of the balance of looking after her falls on her kids, whose lives have been so different from hers.</p>\n\n<p>My point then is a difficult one to conceed. Although my grandmother is my family and helped to raise me, i find spending time with her very difficult. Her views are borderline racist at times, her attitude to the world is very negative, her experience is narrow and her opinions old fashioned. I am expected to show respect and deference to her based purely on the fact that she is older than me, yet i know my experience of the world is richer and wider than hers. I wouldn\'t want to be forced into living in that straight-jacket in order to reduce care costs.</p>\n\n<p>I do think that there are some positive ideas coming through around intergenerational living though. It\'s not that i\'m intrinsically against \'old people\', i think the irony is that i\'m not especially fond of MY \'old people\'. I would be more than willing to help look after a number of more liberally minded old people. It comes down the idea first put forward in the Open&amp;Change discussion in HuisVDH\xa0</p>\n\n<p><em>"Free, but alone." vs. "Belonging,\xa0but coerced"\xa0</em></p>\n\n<p>For me, i\'d rather free and alone. But i can also see the attraction of belonging. But not the coersion.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps this strength of intergenerational bond in Middle Eastern culture is down to having a more cohesive and\xa0consistant\xa0view of the world than we have in the West.

Just starting up a collab working with the Uni of Geneva Center for Affective Sciences on touch and emotions - though that\u2019s not focussing on emotion processing from a cultural perspective, which is what grabbed me about the initiative above.</p>\n\n<p>A slow burner - personally, I need to gain some more active experience to be really useful on this - and very happy to follow this discussion &amp; input if relevant.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>&amp; the Nepal connection\u2026 Worked on a small project in Liverpool after the Nepal earthquake, a Nepalese hornbill audio sculpture that explored how network technology could make audible the word on the street &amp; the dreams people were having\xa0<a href="http://byzantium.chroma.space/about/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://byzantium.chroma.space/about/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://byzantium.chroma.space/about/</a>\xa0 Was designed to be developed for Nepal, but it was vandalised so back to the drawing board with it\u2026 hope it will come through in time. Simple experience gained in the process of making the\xa0work around the dramatic power of shared expression for processing trauma &amp; that network tech makes possible new ways of facilitating this. All sorts of problems around crowd sourcing psychotherapy -\xa0equal relations and shared experience feels like a stronger emphasis: designing systems for\xa0"live", sincere, courageous conversations which puts some trust back in the (extended) neighbourhood as equipped\xa0to hold together around\xa0the varieties of experiences endured on this earth.</p>', u'post_id': 5658, u'date': u'2016-05-21 01:20:40'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'I barely grasp it...', u'comment_id': 18068, u'content': u'<p>Well met again, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/kate_g">@kate_g</a>!

"Something about the experience of another person..." this is how we learn everything in Edgeryders, we discourage vouching opinions and encourage sharing stories (preferably one\'s own) because they are so much thicker and richer.

Through these talks it\xa0came up again and again that a lot of people\xa0really were living through enormously challenging situations and traumas\xa0and very willing to normalise it in conversation\xa0and shrug it off. Listening to people simply as humans without any judgements around what kind of state they were in (eg. seeing all the people I met simply as humans experiencing the world, rather than classifying some as\xa0experiencing states that were\xa0"abnormal" or could be classed as\xa0"mentally ill")\xa0felt like a helpful thing -\xa0the urge to have one\'s experience understood unites everyone. I was thinking about networks that could help this (and thinking around\xa0digital networks - Airbnb / dating apps etc. and looked at\xa0some mental health apps\xa0)\xa0I was mostly thinking about place and the fact that it\xa0is true of all places that there would be really wretched experiences in need of processing and how this reality is something that\xa0needed stepping up to. \xa0I don\'t know of many\xa0political\xa0utopias that really take into account neurodiversity and conditions like\xa0dementia.</p>\n\n<p>This\xa0perspective is drawn from my experience of talking to a multitude of strangers\xa0these last few months and I realise there are many many issues when it comes to mental health. But I\'ll share my naive view as\xa0I\'ve been considering the role that I\'d\xa0taken\xa0up in\xa0wandering about listening\xa0to whoever wanted or needed to talk and about the emotional healing of groups of people and how we so inadequately meet that in product driven cultures. The experience\xa0left me thinking that peer support was exactly what was needed by a lot of people. Psychologists are too expensive for most and online tick boxes are not at all like being listened to or sharing experience.\xa0There is something in spoken expression, being listened to and accepted that is\xa0just vital for emotional processing. With a few technologists I\xa0prototyped some systems that used voice recordings to play back these "real" expressions to others.\xa0Again the emphasis was not on mental illness but on the similarities and the differences in the\xa0longings of the inhabitants of particular locations - the project was inspired by thinking about\xa0how it might be possible to\xa0make networks in Nepal that in some way help\xa0the expression and social processing of the shock around the earthquake.\xa0However,\xa0there had been a depth in\xa0the experience of the interchanges that had happened\xa0whilst\xa0making the recordings that were\xa0more interesting than the voice playback system. The interviews\xa0always came out of a "live" sharing of experience (ie. the interviewee\'s expeirences and my own) and involved risk,\xa0personal disclosure,\xa0agency and shared discovery in a way that listening to a recording does not.\xa0I am still wondering about\xa0digital systems that allow\xa0people to talk directly to each other in a structured way that could help them process their emotional situations. And I considered the various kinds of\xa0conversations people might want - just to speak or perhaps a more formal recorded conversation that involved making a commitment.\xa0Witnessed formal\xa0statements - like rituals - can create marker points in people\'s lives.\xa0Alchoholic\'s anonymous is probably a relevant example.\xa0I wondered about the Samaritans model which sets up this sense that you can make a telephone\xa0call if you are desperate and the "Samaritan" is steady,\xa0sane and absolutely OK. I wonder about\xa0a network\xa0that simply says: whatever you are going through is part of the human experience ie. there is no\xa0broken experience, but there certainly is incredibly challenging experience. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>It feels like a\xa0given that two people who are\xa0in grief may find solace in sharing their\xa0real experience and connecting.\xa0\xa0And yet, to generalise,\xa0Western communities often put empahsis on usefulness in society and direct\xa0those\xa0exhibiting signs of mental distress to simply "be OK"\xa0/ go on medication / fix themeselves\xa0-\xa0\xa0I totally agree with the point you are bringing out that\xa0"the community" is often woefully\xa0dysfunctional at supporting or accepting unusual emotional situations. I wonder about a network that\xa0links people as humans wanting to share something specific in a particular area of the world - so the region is the unifier, not the emotional suffering.\xa0Perhaps I\'m thinking of a more generalised target audience than you are considering but my sense is after walking Liverpool,\xa0that everyone\xa0who lives in a distributed\xa0area\xa0is in\xa0someway involved in processing the emotions experienced in\xa0that place. I\'m aware this is a poetic notion but I think\xa0various imaginative\xa0re-framings\xa0of the issue of mental health\xa0is what\'s needed. Maybe this would only work as a\xa0three way conversation with someone trained and with really\xa0clear guidelines around use but my thinking here is that what\'s needed is not this expert / patient relationship but two humans sharing different experiences of living in a similar\xa0place.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>My friend Denis Ngala at\xa0TICAH, the Trust for Indigenous Culture and Health, an organisation in Kenya that works in linking\xa0health and cultural knowledge was telling me about the work that was being done in Kenya\xa0around victims of torture and reintegrating them back into society after they had given freedom again. The emphasis\xa0he was communicating\xa0was that recovery was not the problem of the victim\xa0of torture\xa0alone, but that it was the\xa0community\'s task. They were working\xa0to educate the community around how to support the individual live beyond\xa0what they had lived through.</p>\n\n<p>Real-life conversations from real experience in which neither party is an expert\xa0can be life changing.\xa0I work a lot with VR and seeing through another\'s eyes is certainly helpful but what\xa0really leads to\xa0change is\xa0honestly communicating difficult\xa0experience and listening to others and accepting their experience. There\'s some sort of validation in the honesty of that\xa0process that allows for shifts.\xa0There are lots of CBT, brain training, "look at things brighter" apps around but perhaps\xa0there\'s room for bold\xa0digital networks - with some serious legal tick boxes in place\xa0-\xa0that\xa0make possible structured honest relational\xa0experiences between people in a particular place. It feels like using the digital to practice honestly speaking and\xa0speaking in one\'s own name rather than anonymously would be helpful at this point. The histories of Snapchat et al. show the many superficial\xa0ways that communication can go, but\xa0there\'s a saviness emerging around\xa0structuring and limiting online\xa0encounter and creating a precise\xa0invitation that makes me think it\'s possible. Online experiences\xa0that move\xa0into\xa0relational and creative territory and away\xa0from the sense that\xa0mental difficulties have to be born alone like a scapegoat in the desert or solved once and for all\xa0like winning in a\xa0game - there\'s something about the unique experience of another person that is a random element that can startle out of insularity. An app for conversation for people in a particular country? A way of marking personal commitments to the self and receiving some real social validation for it? A whole raft of comedy solutions that normalise\xa0being in dire straights and make\xa0it feel like it\'s worth making the epic journey back to life?\xa0Not sure, but you\'re right that there is a real need for help\xa0with\xa0processing emotions and it\'s something that a healthy culture should be able to give. \xa0</p>', u'post_id': 5658, u'date': u'2016-05-19 03:55:11'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Support rather than "fixes"', u'comment_id': 12059, u'content': u'<p>And here it is.

Do we need one person to focus solely on ensuring a quality experience for these participants? If so is there an obvious candidate?

"Normal" ethno research works with audio recordings, that are then transcribed. And transcription is a very big deal in ethnography. Researchers are armed with resources like\xa0<a href="http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/projects/transcription/A02asymbols.pdf">this</a>: write (<em>H)</em>\xa0when the informant \xa0utters an "audible inhalation", (<em>Hx)</em>\xa0when she utters an "audible exhalation". Write\xa0<em>@ </em>for laughter ("one per pulse", so @ @ @) etc. etc.</p>\n\n<p>Trouble with that, there is a tradeoff between transcription accuracy and costs of data, so, ultimately, between transcription accuracy and number of informants that ethnographers can afford to have in a study. Already 10 years ago, in a relatively low-cost (Western) country like Italy, transcriptions cost 100 EUR per hour of recording. My colleagues at UNIMORE tried the time-honored academic move to deploy unpaid students as transcribers, but it did not work. The transcriptions were of too low quality. So, ethnography was always a small-numbers research techniques: 20 informants is a respectable number in a study. In opencare, with 50% of the project done, we have already 202.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Ethnography in its traditional form will continue to exist. But opencare is trying to repurpose it\xa0to serve it as a tool for collective intelligence. And collective intelligence needs... collective, i.e. fairly large numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The professional quality audio recordings of Taking Care, I think, go to prove my point. We have them. But no one, it seems, has the time and \xa0interest to listen to them and transcribe them... so they stay unavailable. You could put them on SoundCloud without transcription, but I doubt many people would play them and engage with their content. Whereas I got in touch with Luca from Dynamoscopio, armed with my written notes, and we agreed to do a post on Mercato Lorenteggio in English together.

I disagree with your solution, though, even if it were technically realistic.\xa0Dictation software would just take a "snapshot" of what people say as they say it. This would make for unreadable material: lots of "ehms" and "ahs", sentences that do not close, missing body language (like nodding when others speak).\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The act of writing contains editorialisation. It is a real transcoding from one medium (speech) to another (writing), not just a copy-paste. Ethnographers know this well: they are used to working with recordings.\xa0By insisting on natively online conversation, we crowsdource the editorialisation, and that saves\xa0<em>a lot</em>\xa0of researcher time. Additionally, it empowers the participant, who takes control of the medium in which her content will be consumed by others. Chances of being misunderstood or misrepresented go way down. For example, if I say something with a light-hearted mood to a journalist in an interview, I trust that person with putting my light-hearted remark in the right context, and not making it sound like a serious one. But if I am blogging, \xa0I can take care of that myself. I can also censor myself. And, believe me, I do.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>So, no microphones in the room. Let\'s not make a reality show of a result-oriented conversation! <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 6069, u'date': u'2016-12-15 12:49:00'}, {u'user_id': 2464, u'title': u'Looking at things from a distance', u'comment_id': 26649, u'content': u'<p>And I mean a distance, because my background places me rather far from both care and ethnography.</p>\n\n<p>On a personal and cultural level, I easily link with Alberto\'s comment on the fact that offline (shall we say "on-site") engagement may be difficult for some people. Bringing your thought into\xa0public space is challenging. Personal differences (personality, language, culture) get amplified.\xa0Online forums are <strong>asynchronous</strong>, this is what gives you time and space to form your ideas and bring them into words. And it\'s true you don\'t have to "fight" to get to the end of your sentence <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> (Take it from a Canadian, living in Europe for quite a number of years, I had to learn how to "fight" and I am still quite bad at it ...).\xa0Also, engaging in <strong>synchronous</strong> space is difficult partly because participants have different background on the questions being discussed, some being specialists, other having "real" experience dealing with the issues being discussed ... etc.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose the best of the two worlds is to be able to <em>mix synchronous and asynchronous interaction</em>.</p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, I wish to make a comment\xa0on another aspect of the question Alberto is putting on the table.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that there is added value in studying the engagement process\xa0(here the exchange of ideas\xa0between participants). Studying the process: being able to see ideas or knowledge collectively form. Now\xa0the process we study is, not only asynchronous and/or synchronous, it is <strong>distributed</strong>: occuring at different times and locations,\xa0involving different people\xa0in numerous parallel conversations.</p>\n\n<p>This is where we may hope to use a bit of technology to help us recover the dynamics and look at things. The direction we follow is to collect exchanges between people and use this as a fairly reliable\xa0trace of how the process developed. Having a longer piece of content summarizing the exchanges is not the same, as you cannot "replay" the exchanges -- although it certainly is valuable (don\'t get me wrong, I am\xa0not saying storytelling has no value).</p>\n\n<p>So in a sense,\xa0the problem is not having things online or on-site. Any <strong>trace</strong> allowing to replay the dynamics can be used to look at the collective process.</p>\n\n<p>If we\'d have a (cheap, please) technology that would recognize people\'s voice signature,\xa0and reliably turn audio signal into text, we\'d be fine and the opencare consortium would have saved itself time and energy\xa0struggling between online or on-site. We\'d turn on this technology during on-site activities and feed whatever container (to make the exchanges available to others to hear live or listen to later (we\'d even be able to make it avialble to the visually disabled!).\xa0People would be able to comment and keep discussing afterwards with people who were not necessarily on-site.</p>\n\n<p>We\'d still need to offer both on-site (synchronous) and online (asynchronous) forms of exchanges though to increase the openess of the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p>This is what we must aim for: a combined synchronous-asynchronous mode of exchanges deployed both on-site and online, with whatever is needed to keep the best posible traces of the process. Then go <em>recursive</em>:\xa0feed the process with whatever knowledge we can gain on the process itself, as it develops.</p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p>Hey, I got to the end of this post and you read me through without interrupting! <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 6069, u'date': u'2016-12-15 10:39:00'}, {u'user_id': 3069, u'title': u'Interesting insights, @Alberto.\xa0 I have a few questions:\n\n\n\n\nAn ', u'comment_id': 23578, u'content': u'<p>Interesting insights, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/alberto">@Alberto</a>.\xa0 I have a few questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li><em><strong>An ethnography of makers collaboration</strong>.

It does seem that the existence of two approaches is now established. We knew this from before\xa0"Taking care", but I at least found it useful (if difficult) to go through the full experience of offline.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I would like to suggest a different approach from the one you propose. You questions are obviously relevant, but I think we are not in a position to address them yet: we lack the necessary evidence. We have anecdotes ("people find writing\xa0difficult", "hackers are good collaborators", "good collaboration minimizes verbosity"), but no real research on the matter. So, I propose to move from normative to positive research questions. You ask "<strong>how <em>can</em> we obtain something which is desirable, for example open care services?</strong>" I would like to ask "<strong>how do desirable results <em>actually</em> obtain?</strong>".\xa0</p>\n\n<p>There is little doubt that better, cheaper, faster coordination is conducive to better outcomes in all collaborative efforts, including open care (following your notation: open care is the care that happens out there and is open). <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/free-innovation">von Hippel</a>, for example, makes a strong case that what he calls "free innovators"\xa0<em>systematically</em>\xa0underinvest in diffusion efforts (documentation). He is supported by empirical research in six countries. So, I would start by building a micro model of how collaboration (building and making accessible documentation)\xa0<em>actually happens.\xa0</em>I would keep very close track of online-offline.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Example: one of the examples given by von Hippel is NightScout. In the story as he tells it, the collaboration happens entirely online, and is triggered by, of all platoforms, Twitter:</p>\n\n<p>On May 14 last year, he [Costik] tweeted a picture of his solution: a way to upload the Dexcom receiver\u2019s data to the Internet using his software, a $4 cable and an Android phone. That tweet caught the eye of other engineers across the country. One was Lane Desborough, an engineer with a background in control systems for oil refineries and chemical plants whose son, 15, has diabetes. Mr. Desborough had designed a home-display system for glucose-monitor data and called it NightScout. But his system couldn\u2019t connect to the Internet, so it was merged with Mr. Costik\u2019s software to create the system used today.</p>\n\n<p>I am sure that\'s not the whole story. So, here\'s the paper I\'d like you to write, possibly involving some students:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Some in depth case studies of collaboration taken from open care initiatives. The case studies would go micro on collaboration: ok, so Desborough saw Costik\'s tweet. Then what? Did they meet? When? To do what? Did Costik redirect Desborough onto GitHub, or BitBucket? Did he email his own notes? What happened as the project scaled? Etcetera. There is an obvious partner for this: Patient Innovation.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Some field work on the same thing based on what OpenCare (the project)\xa0is doing. How do people collaborate in the WeMake lab and with the broader world (technical forums etc.)? How is free-form conversation conducive to people working more together? How is working more together conducive to creating better results? We have at least four cases of people "doing things together" that seem to have met through OpenCare, but researchers could also track some of the hundreds of initiatives that have been reported.\xa0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>So. You (Ezio) could build a small team\xa0and direct them.

One of the most remarkable guys who hangs out Edgeryders, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/johncoate">@johncoate</a> , used to work for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL">The WELL</a>, the world\'s very first online community that was intentionally designed as such.

Not by our standards. And yet, it flourished. What\'s more, the different forums ("conferences") had the exact same interface,\xa0but very different cultures.

This story is narrated by <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/howard_rheingold">@Howard_Rheingold</a> in a fantastic book called <a href="http://www.rheingold.com/vc/book/">The Virtual Community</a>.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>So, I think you are wise not to bank on the direct democracy software to sort everything out.

More background reading and stories\xa0from the news today:\xa0<a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/students-have-made-martin-shkreli-s-750-drug-in-their-chem-lab-for-just-2"></a><a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/students-have-made-martin-shkreli-s-750-drug-in-their-chem-lab-for-just-2">http://www.sciencealert.com/students-have-made-martin-shkreli-s-750-drug-in-their-chem-lab-for-just-2</a>. The Shkreli story has been all over the web for a while now and shows exactly the perversities that are going on. And the real problem is summed up in a quote I read from Shkreli himself, which basically said what he did was common practise. And he\'s right.</p>\n\n<p>The obvious societal and ethical implications of having eg. insulin more accessible makes it worth pursuing as well... The insulin is a long way off being useful as a medicine and I\'ve read most of the team is aware of this.\xa0The potential of open medicine is there in the long term however.\xa0It will need some serious conversation on ethical, medical, legal and other consequences. Luckily, the biohacker community has strong ethics and is open to have the conversation they are starting. It\'s one worth having in my eyes.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, how about that Skype call <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/dfko">@dfko</a> ?

Many of my efforts recently have been along the lines of building communication networks that amplify the real knowledge of a community. This is helpful info. Was reading about the Nepal work recently. Respect!</p>\n\n<p>In an art context,\xa0 I\u2019ve favoured systems that use cheap speakers &amp; computing platforms - <a href="https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/wiki/What-is-Bela%3F" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/wiki/What-is-Bela%3F</a> The ritualistic attempt to voice what has not been voiced feels suited to something more public like a sculpture\xa0- eg. recent attempt with\xa0small bird sculpture in Liverpool that had speakers inside it <a href="http://byzantium.chroma.space/about/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://byzantium.chroma.space/about/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://byzantium.chroma.space/about/</a></p>\n\n<p>But you\u2019re right that when it comes to spreading info &amp; learning material, personal listening as you work is the way (&amp; listening also cuts out the problem of not being able to study in the dark.) The mp3 system feels like it has really great potentials for education - and also distributing more taboo info like facts about AIDS and addiction treatment programmes.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/trythis">@trythis</a> I will pass this on to Ngala and some NGOs working with addiction &amp; will be in contact if there\'s interest.</p>\n\n<p>One question - why not distribute cheap phones rather than mp3 players? Is it battery considerations? Phones seem to be altogether more useful and could simplify the problem of how to get the audio back?</p>\n\n<p>On the subject of making the content accessible but also inspiring &amp; interactive I think there\'s interesting creative questions. It\u2019s pretty clear that \u201ddigging into a niche\u201d is going to be more effective as a distribution method (though realise this has to be proved if you\u2019re doing an academic study.) When it comes to replicating the \u201chuman touch\u201d that Ngala gave to his work through his supportive presence, it feels like powerful design of the audio experience can hold that sense of the encouragement and support of another person. Interested how you meet that creative design question? ie. recording compelling content and storytelling that addresses the listener in a way that encourages interaction. There\u2019s a few decades of experiments with this personal &amp; empowering mode of address in the self help / meditation / change your life audio genre\u2026</p>\n\n<p>I reckon the other big creative challenge is a really accessible intuitive and compelling site that hosts all the monologues collected and that feels \u201calive\u201d with the word of the community &amp; updates often. Think there are some beautiful solutions evolving with immersive web and web VR. The clouds documentary <a href="http://cloudsdocumentary.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://cloudsdocumentary.com/</a>\xa0 gives a nice example of fluidly exploring knowledge. But a challenge I\u2019ve encountered is that curating and ensuring that the content remains relevant can be a full time job. However perhaps if you\u2019ve got a strong interactive web design that role can be automated or distributed.</p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/trythis">@trythis</a> Do you envision asking listeners to speak back to a particular question? That feels like it would have some good focus to it.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>On translating - I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a necessity to have local collaborators and fluent speakers of the language in the core team whenever this kind of knowledge share project runs.\xa0Perhaps also\xa0there\u2019s something to learn from Duolingo and it\u2019s method of getting language learners translating. There are so many language learning initiatives to encourage people back into learning languages other than english. If you can connect with people who are learning the language and you have the need for spoken translation, there\'s a useful\xa0match.</p>\n\n<p>Spreading info, language learning, cultural sharing and circulating cheap creative technology &amp; making skills all feel like they go together well.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve met a lot of people working with teaching languages that are dwindling in numbers. Teachers of the Maori language and the Khoisan languages of the San Bushman people. They have often complained how young people are led away from learning about their own culture by fascination in smartphones / iPads / all things modern. Combining cultural knowledge &amp; language learning with what is considered aspirational tech can be a big motivator.

I actually want very limited capability on the players to start with so that you have to listen through a lecture to get to the infotainment/music part behind it. The cheapo players are fine for that. The other thing that is partially a feature is their crappy 110mAh battery. Currently I am testing the common failure modes, and it also looks like it will be possible to run them without battery directly from either a bucked 12V battery, or a boosted low voltage source (AAA), and of course sunny PV. All of those options (and more) will be in a full kit. In terms of wearing them - they work fine under a hat or headscarf. With 15g they should not be much of a nuisance around the neck either.</p>\n\n<p>As for mp3 recorder I think you are right - there is no <em>really </em>cheap option. I\'ve bought this ASIN B01G8OK1O6 for 20$ and it works very well so far. However at that cost I can\'t hand them out to just anyone, but I first have to find reliable candidates. Probably I\'ll also have to work with other recording formats in the beginning. There are a couple of other somewhat decent recorders around 10-15$ but they don\'t save into mp3 or aren\'t exactly inuitive.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your translation (I assume mostly into audio format) this is what I would do: Go around at the schools and ask the teachers if they can recommend someone who has a nice voice and good pronounciation and English skills. Ugliness, bad eyesight, physical deformity, rural upbringing is all a big plus. Probably won\'t hurt if you let 3-5 try translating and recording the same piece. Then find someone above average knowledgeable in the actual field work who has a somewhat deeper understanding of the issues and let him/her review the recordings. That is your first team. Then make second team like that and use it to translate some sections of the first piece back into English. Eventually you will probably need a Nepalese speaker who picks up enough audacity (the software) to process this intermediate product into a decent lecture - this person can sit anywhere though.</p>', u'post_id': 553, u'date': u'2016-11-24 19:09:10'}, {u'user_id': 5, u'title': u'Nice one!', u'comment_id': 27569, u'content': u'<p>Thanks for the pointer, Alberto. Actually <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/trythis">@trythis</a> was the inspiration for the Rasoberry Pi local media servers after the Nepal earthquake last year, and this way also for Pocket University. Lots of inspiration coming from that guy <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I\'d be interested to utilize a small casting / pocket university like setup for teaching better coffee farming in <a href="https://www.google.de/maps/place/Hansapur,+Nepal/&lt;span%20class=">@28.0295096,84.4467343,14676a,20y,41.63h,62.8t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x39953fa2e0beb76d:0xeb467b0ef0d2342b!8m2!3d28.1652914!4d84.6322156?hl=en"&gt;Hansapur, Gorkha, Nepal</a>. Which is the village for this year\'s trial of our "direct international sales of Nepali coffee" project. Just a small project for now, with a friend from last year going there around next week and then again in February. The problem is obviously getting the coffee farming content together, in Nepali \u2026</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> For extending smallcasting to two-way communication, it would of course be perfect to have a small cheap MP3 player with recorder. But does not exist as far as I know. Feedback recording via mobile phone is possible for &gt;80% of people in low-infrastructure regions, but of course voice quality is an issue then. Most times, I get back to using old-ish smartphones since they are available for &lt;15 EUR used in Europe. Battery capacity is an issue of course \u2026</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Two hardware inspirations for <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/trythis">@trythis</a> which I found for Pocket University: (1) there are 10-20 MP3 player models which can be fitted with an <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/">aftermarket open source firmware</a> \u2026 of course good to mod / extend the player. (2) there are <a href="http://www.dx.com/s/sports+headphone+mp3+player">cheap MP3 players in neck-worn form factor</a>, which to me seems the best to allow working while listening, without interfering with cables, or earplugs falling out all the time etc..</p>', u'post_id': 553, u'date': u'2016-11-24 11:10:00'}, {u'user_id': 2551, u'title': u'Yeah they are related', u'comment_id': 27320, u'content': u'<p>We combined our idea soups on the topic for the Nepal Hackathon but I think both of us had similar ideas bouncing around for year before that.</p>\n\n<p>Small casting is just another riff on the concept which would share a lot of the same hardware and some of the same content I assume. After reading around a lot of the World Bank issues it seemed to me a good MVP-style approach that could disintermediate and also flank their ongoing projects.</p>\n\n<p>One point that set it apart from PU is that this one is more geared towards information flow BACK to the party doing an intervention. The idea is that staff will get a handful of mp3 players (and colored pearls for stringing up) with say 2-3 different sets of "directions" to traverse the OFFLINE social networks to carry on them at all times. When they come across an "interesting person" (e.g. very altruistic behavior, subject to certain condition, etc.) they can, without a word, hand them the mp3 player and things can expand from there. With the right incentives (perhaps including m-pesa) there is potential for large amounts of very detailed quant (coded with the colored pearls) + qual that should be relatively undistorted.</p>\n\n<p>By default one could have most of the players in circulation doing more of a PU for poor young women with the appropriate content and a good amount of infotainment mixed in. And of course 1-2 tracks for repairing/charging etc. the players, 2-3 tracks for getting the feedback from the women, and perhaps another couple (later in the process) for building the capability to translate/record additional lectures into the local language.</p>\n\n<p>I currently have envisioned about 100 mp3 players (shared among 2-3 people each) with appropriate support to keep them going for a couple of months minimum in the field which runs slightly above 1000 USD. Of course it\'ll be critical to work on ways to reduce the technical attrition rate and balance/channel "misuse" into something arguably helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Then it would be interesting to see how results vary between a "helicopter distribution" vs "digging into a niche". And of course on the horizon is the ability to plug these collected monologues or discussion into a platform like ER. That way you\'re not only getting the "word on the street" but also the "word at the water hole" with some lag in very rural places.</p>', u'post_id': 553, u'date': u'2016-11-24 08:18:43'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Small casting =&gt; pocket university?', u'comment_id': 26964, u'content': u'<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/trythis">@trythis</a> this reminds me of the concept of "pocket university" proposed by <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/matthias">@Matthias</a> . <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 553, u'date': u'2016-11-23 20:44:35'}, {u'user_id': 2551, u'title': u'Thanks for sharing!', u'comment_id': 26057, u'content': u'<p>These stories here are so well written and impressive - and this one particularly so.</p>\n\n<p>It still took me a few attempts to endeavour it, because more often than not it\'ll tempt you to throw everything down and want to help with what the author is working on.

The strucure of the content is important because I hope to turn the play+listener into a temporary agent (a little tolkeen\'s ring style). So you would have incentives there for the player (or several) to traverse the community networks in a mix of chance, human behavior, and programming, and hopefully end up in someones lap who may have been incredibly hard to find using other methods.</p>\n\n<p>You can then get the recorder to this person (or have the person respond via a phone recording in a "relatively 1st world context") and document things in long form (8 GB - up to a week). Parts of this will be amiable for speech to text conversion. ( <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/brenoust">@brenoust</a> that is why I asked the last time we talked)</p>\n\n<p>Once you get the text corpus you can open it up the the digital domain ( <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/amelia">@amelia</a> can then probably mine this from an enthnograpic/anthropologic perspective) while it can remail fully anonymous. I also have a concept in mind for quantitative feedback which is similarly simple tech for users (colored beads on a string) but machine readable.</p>\n\n<p>That way you get quant + qual abstractions but you can still jump to the original content fairly easily (provided you speak the language). It ought to scale quite well, especially if you can reuse some of the players.</p>\n\n<p>The motivation for this came from a number of directions (OLPC griping, importance to capture emotion in human interaction, World Bank issues/capability building (two way!)) so I\'ve played through a couple of different concepts that can perhaps be divided by organizational/technical aspects, content/didactic aspects, and info flow direction/volume.</p>\n\n<p>I\'m currently working on putting together a prototype kit that could plausibly run for a couple of months (and with minor support perhaps years) as a replacement for a "sit-in school" in remote areas that have trouble with teacher absenteeism ( <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/nadia">@nadia</a> perhaps interesting to Olivier @ Co - also best of luck in Paris!) and people being too poor to abstain from manual labour for so long (and of course blind, illiterate, etc.). At the moment I\'m checking the recharge curves to see how long the cheapo players will survive before someone needds to know how to fix/replace/work around the battery. If any of you see potential there I\'d be happy to discuss it and set it up as a proper story.</p>\n\n<p>*that is why the working title is currently "small casting".

The site has undergone a number of iterations to get to where it is now and i think that we have a site that is much smoother and more aesthetically pleasing than when i joined the community a year ago.</p>\n\n<p>I agree that the mobile access is a problem, and it seems there are people working in the background to solve that. My view is that when i log in on my mobile i just want to read a comment or post. I'm probably not going to sit and write a response on my phone because i prefer to think deeply about my responses and respond in depth. My view is that i don't need to site to act as a social media platform. I want depth of field, not speed here.</p>\n\n<p>I quite like that the 'obsolete comments' remain in the system. Every few weeks i spend a day digging through the old projects, conversations etc on the site. It helps me see how things have developed and where the issues have been. I gain a much greater understanding of the path, the battles and the 'big picture' when i get lost down the old blind alleys and dead ends.\xa0I think if we moved to a position where we only showed the finished product and not the working out we are giving a false impression, plus i imagine it would have negative impacts on both the 'openness' and the ability to analyse and extract quality data from the platform. But i wouldn't know anything about that specifically as i'm not a computer network scientist. I'm a poet and creative producer.</p>\n\n<p>I too am a big fan of the Google Docs set up. We use it to set up some of the Culture Team documents, and i think Alberto has had some successes using it for the OpenandChange application. It seems to work best for input from between 4-5 active collaborators though. I do think that it does decrease the number of people who engage with the document and\xa0there are some on ER that are disincentivised to use Google products. Where input is wanted\xa0from as many people as possible i think the messy solution on the site is still best for collecting that information from everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Those are my initial thoughts on your points.

This is a very well-thought through service. What I love most is your response team concept: it works even at the level of, say, 10 friends that live in a 2 km radius from each other. Then, like the best networks, it can be\xa0<em>scale-free:</em>\xa0suppose I am using Buoy here in Brussels, I have my little response team etc. Next up, I\xa0visit my friend in Milano; suddenly I am detached from my response team, but if my friend is also using Buoy, she and I can be on each other\'s response team. Also, she can ask her own response team to opt in in my own, and viceversa I will be part of theirs. Voil\xe0: everyone in my friend\'s response team now has skeletal Buoy coverage should they ever come to Brussels \u2013 and of course I can ask my response team to add them, too.

I think I may have not been clear in that while my school takes classes through the online platform we do live together during the school year. Though you do raise an interesting point of how to facilitate a similar sense of community through online communities. Have been a memeber of a few I think a big mistake a lot of groups try and do is replicate in person activites, like a bunch of people just hanging out through webcam. And to me that will always fall short of the live in person dynamic. I think one answer is to organizng physical met ups based off of promitiy of people, which works to an extent.</p>\n\n<p>But for me the best online communities I\'ve been in have used the fact the memebers are so spread out to there advantage. I think a good example of this is Under 30 Changemakers, which hosts discussions\xa0and training through google hangouts. Instead of having broad web-chats they pre-choose discussion topics based off of community interests or world events and invite their memebers to bring in their perspective. That way people come in already invested in the topic and feel more connected to the community by interacting with members who share their passions. \xa0Also, another activity that seems to go well it when people sign up to be matched with another random member for a skype session. The excitment of not knowing who you\'ll met but that you have this one community incommon is pretty enaging.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>', u'post_id': 724, u'date': u'2016-08-28 21:26:38'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Online complicates matters', u'comment_id': 14631, u'content': u'<p>Welcome, <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/shajara">@Shajara</a> !

What we think of as archetypally women\'s work \u2013 looking after people, seeing to their wants and needs, explaining, reassuring, anticipating what the boss wants or is thinking, not to mention caring for, monitoring, and maintaining plants, animals, machines, and other objects \u2013 accounts for a far greater proportion of what working-class people do when they\'re working than hammering, carving, hoisting, or harvesting things.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>This is true not only because most working-class people are women (since most people in general are women), but because we have a skewed view even of what men do.

So, it is always privately optimal to dump the cost of healing onto others, rather than assume the cost of prevention oneself.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Seen through this lens, community provision is fundamentally different, because the entity receiving the care is not an individual, but the (sub-Dunbar or equivalent) community,\xa0<em>and that\'s the same as the payer.\xa0</em>Hence the apparent lack of market failure in care provision among the Amish.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>So what\'s going on with prevention of unwanted pregnancies? Public health people I have talked to tend to shrug and say it\'s endemic. The window of opportunity for stupid and careless behaviour\xa0is a little too wide, the drive for instant gratification over prudence is literally a biological imperative, and even the best contraceptives only have a 99.99% effectiveness. If, say, in Italy you have about 20 million couples, if 10% of them are having sex tonight and all of them use contraception, you are going to get 200 unwanted pregnancies <em>tonight,</em>\xa0in just one European country. Best you can do is reduce the incidence of such incidents, but no human society ever achieved zero unwanted pregnancies.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 793, u'date': u'2016-10-19 20:00:12'}, {u'user_id': 5, u'title': u'Can P2P create preventive solutions?', u'comment_id': 23368, u'content': u'<p>While this story documents the power of underground networks to find pragmatic solutions, I am wondering if and why "P2P care" solutions do not equally pop up to create solutions through prevention (that is, preventing the pregnancies in the first place)? It <em>could</em> be that P2P solutions have a problem with collective motivation here, just as governments tend to rather react that act proactively, but more severe since P2P / underground solutions are so resource constrained. If so, that could point to a major issue with all P2P solutions into care (that is, making for a nice research focus).</p>\n\n<p>I\'m pretty sure there is common ground to say prefentive solutions are preferrable (assuming that women who are undergoing abortion would have preferred not to, that is, not to have become pregnant in the first place). So, no need to refer to laws or morals. Even if the law allows it, there is <em>still</em> reason to prevent pregnancy.</p>\n\n<p>So even though contraception is widely available in Europe, on a society scale there are still this many unwanted pregnancies. What I\'m wondering here is about the reasons for this, and what P2P initiatives can do and are doing here? Of course this will have to do a lot with slow-changing "fuzzy targets" like culture, taboos, sexual practices and preferences.

The silver lining is that communities tend to step into giving\xa0care, and to do so more when the care problem is "close to home". In the end, reproductive health and control over one\'s body are an absolute, so prohibitions don\'t work. People go underground, organize informal networks, and things happen anyway.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>And this means that, maybe, a good way to do public policy on care is just to let people free to provide for each other, then step in to help with those which are obviously the most pressing concerns, such as this one.

Probably after decades of liberal regulations to some extent women are aware of the fact that abortions are needed, but catholic brainwashing has been so effective, that they're trapped between the moral and the pragmatic views on abortion. Now what seems to prove this is that women are not interested in lobbying for their right to abortion - they somehow agree to comply with the rules by having them underground and accepting the stigma, rather than fighting\xa0for their rights. Imagine even if the lowest estimate of 80.000 women having illegal abortions a year is right, and 10 percent of them would be up to fight with the system on that, we'd have a pretty great leverage to change the law by now. But we don't. have that. Well, at least until now - but this remains to be seen because we also have a conservative revival going on and if the church steps in, you never know who'd stay on top of things. I'd rather not expect us going any more liberal than we're at the moment.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Another thing is that part of the available options just use the loopholes, they're not illegal.

We're observing a bit mobilization of civil society ever since the new government came into power, but that rarely brought any results. At the end, they use their democratic victory to pass any decision they seem fit - and giving up on a project of an outrageous reform just to keep rather shameful status quo is not a huge failure for them I believe.

People can try their hand at roles, then maybe move on to different ones in the next project.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>This allows for some limited pairwise adjusting, too. I prefer pure research to\xa0middle management roles, and I prefer middlie management to leadership. Still,\xa0in many of my former projects\xa0I had to lead, because no one else would do it (or could do it).

When numbers are in,\xa0it\xa0takes a conscious effort just to establish processes, or make norms more explicit\xa0i.e. double check understanding of the task at hand; make sure there is at least someone committed to the task; reinforcing that it\'s OK to ask for help; to fail etc.</p>\n\n<p>What I found that works is treating everything as a project in and of itself and assigning roles within the project.

I recommend you use non-toxic pigment (and still use masks - just to spread awareness), and there are a bunch of non-toxic to fairly harmless liquids to mix stuff into (e.g linseed oil*). You can get a lot done with mortar and pestle for personalization scale.</p>\n\n<p>Other things that help are fabrics with nice haptic properties (you can sew together patch-work style). Needle skills are nice to have anyway if you want/have to live low budget. Just make sure you get good thread. Fabric will also improve overall acoustics.</p>\n\n<p>Pull broken head-phones out of the trash and fix them (9/10 are broken at the jack, you can fix them with almost nothing, if you are good you can re-use the solder that is already on them. Then you only need a lighter/candle and e.g. some liquid adhesive and string to fix things permanently. A quiet atmosphere and my (home) sounds around me help my mood a lot.</p>\n\n<p>LEDs are another option for color personalization instead of paint. If you DIY, just make sure you understand what resistor you need. You will need one unless you do plug in LED-bands which are relatively expensive (but still not bad, you could also cannibalize them). If treated right LEDs will last forever though.</p>\n\n<p>*Not sure how well that works on particle board though. Epoxy is the solution that will always work (and can also be used to fix a lot of other stuff) but is potentially somewhat toxic, moderately expensive (if you buy a big just past shelf life bucket), and needs some know-how and tools to avoid a utter uncleanable mess.

It was in fact not the best move as the exercice takes about 30 minutes daily, which would require a lot of resources to have interesting games, plus the fact that the exercice is quite strict, so challenging to make it interesting. We then thought about other, more free gameplays, which we have to develop. We are now working on mini-games for asthma, that are about triggers and how to take the medicine. We want to reuse the work done for CF to build short games for aerosoltherapy.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding tests, we did a prestudy with ten children in a hospital, to see their interest, and that was positive. We are preparing two studies with focus groups to test the games that have been improved.</p>\n\n<p>Many learnings were also about setting the collaboratife framework, platform, etc. We are writing a few articles about that, that should be released in the next month. The initiative mostly advances during events as our community is always small, but we start to have funding and are going to redistribute them, with the aim to mobilize contributors on the long run. One big challenge is also that our non-exclusive model is not easily understood by authorities, so it takes a lot of time to explain it, and many fundings are not available as most competitions support profit-driven organizations. So we are thinking about creating a specific structure to be able to access these resources. Another thing is to move from proprietary to free softwares, for example from Google docs to a wiki, or from Unity game engine to another one. So they are lots of interesing challenges at different levels. <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>We invite you to subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2bK-LCBKF3SeFATwgg3U6g" rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a>, where we are going to release 15 interviews of what participants learned during the last gamejam.

Example in question: I\'m following <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cleanupversovarockbeach/">a community in Mumbai</a> doing regular cleanups on a local beach. They pulled some 3000 metric tons of plastic garbage from the ocean, but obviously the city always provides more. So back in July, a friend from Mumbai was looking for ways to catch the garbage while it\'s carried in the river and before it reaches the shore, and together we found <a href="https://swachhbharat.mygov.in/activities/indigenously-designed-floating-barrier-rivers-and-streams-control-solid-waste">this barrier boom</a> technology, produced locally in India by <a href="http://www.alphamers.com/innovation">a company from Bangalore</a>. So the tech part is solved in principle (and the barrrier can even be installed in a way that lets boats pass.) But we are at a loss how to organize people to get this thing purchased (or DIY made) installed.

(Plenty still exists and thrives today: plenty.org). \xa0Because we had to provide emergency health care to ourselves (the Farm had more than 1000 people at the time) and because some of those educated people wanted to apply themselves toward meaningful work that was also interesting, we had an unusually large group of EMTs, paramedics, nurses and other health care workers.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing how bad things were up in the south Bronx, we decided to go up there and see for ourselves if we could lend a hand.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to early 1978. \xa0A group of us located a suitable building and squatted in it, fixing it into a livable place.

But aside these differences, we all share humanity and the fact that, in some way or another, we all are familiar with pain, with trauma. Not sharing the same language can be difficult too, but I\'ve helped many people talking in a language that is neither their not my mother language. Also, communication is larger than words: expression, visual support, eye contact and even touch can be means of understanding and helping too. When their is no common language, I work with a translator sometimes too.</p>\n\n<p>As for Medecins sans fronti\xe8res, I applied for a position in the field - but was not accepted. Like many \'traditional\' NGO\'s they have quite rigid and out-of-date conditions of admission - like requiring a master degree in psychology. I have a master in philosophy, 4 years of study in psychotherapy and a specialisation in psychotraumatalogy plus 10 years of experience. Nevertheless I do not meet the \'official\' requirements. The recognition of psychotherapy as a valid profession is a complex issue and one that is colonized in Belgium by the medical professions, which is the mean reason why people like me, highly skilled psychotherapists,\xa0 are not recognized as such.

I would put it a bit differently - it has not been \'becoming\' evidence-based in the sense of people changing how they practice. It is more a case of practitioners, who have ample experience of the effectiveness of the treatments in their own practices, looking to find ways to produce acceptable evidence to back this up so it will be more widely accepted by the mainstream.</p>\n\n<p>As with all physical interventions, this is not easy! You can\'t really run a double-blind control study on a physical therapy where the patient can feel whether it\'s being done or not, and a lot of the resistance to accepting acupuncture involves either rejecting all the \'lesser\' forms of evidence for its effectiveness, or designing \'sham\' studies that don\'t really take into account how acupuncture works.</p>\n\n<p>All that said, there is still a lot of evidence for its effectiveness for a variety of conditions.

The only difference is that I do appreciate that Uber/Airbnb create some value for local communities, by giving some extra freedom to people on the ground. For example, say\xa0you notice that there is a long queue for taxis at your local airport on Friday nights.\xa0You can then in principle step in as an Uber driver and make yourself availabe for that time slot, if you need the money more than the time. It is a market clearing mechanism, but a clearing market is, in itself, a good thing. What\'s bad is a market underpinned by asymmetric power relationships. But we have that anyway: taxi drivers telling people "you can\'t work here, this is our turf" is an act of violence. It is no coincidence that most Uber drivers in Brussels are\xa0Arabs: plenty of unemployed/underemployed young Arabs in town, and\xa0Uber lowers the threshold for them to enter the business.

But de facto\xa0they operate in the same market\xa0except not playing by the same rules as everyone, and taking a route in which they dont make a claim on new and better rules. Or maybe I\'m missing that claim.\xa0To me, the difference between future clinics such as <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/steelweaver">@steelweaver</a> \'s or\xa0Helliniko-turned-big and services like UBER is that the former reshape markets to make it better for an overwhealming majority, while the latter just want to stay outside markets for a bigger margin. Yes, they made a contribution in their disruption - I see how bigger the service quality is\xa0on the local taxi market where I live and where UBER just arrived, but that\'s not enough when they can potentially take more from the community than what they give.</p>', u'post_id': 671, u'date': u'2016-09-09 18:25:00'}, {u'user_id': 137, u'title': u'In my opinion te cases against Uber and ', u'comment_id': 19048, u'content': u"<p>In my opinion te cases against Uber and Airbnb are valid even if I love the ideas behind them. Uber is getting sued for not providing their drivers with essential support: health care, insurance, repair\xa0costs while being free to bring down the prices. And as Google is joining the race, prices will go down. Another problem with Uber is its hunger for monopolizing the markets around - which hopefully will be stopped as well, although this will happen most likely thanks to other giants.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>About Airbnb, you are entitled to rent a spare room where you live - the case is against fake sharing, de facto homes and apartments that were emptied so the owners would make money on short term rentals. This changes the landscape of the city and has huge, negative effects.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>probably the difference between scaling and monopolizing markets is one of the criteria here. These startups lost the reasonable idea of scale and infringed territories. Hotels and taxi corporation will protect their share and lobby against these companies, which doesn't need to be good in results. But these battles amplified processes in the urban spaces which could have been happening more quietly before, and that's good. And made people think about sharing and new ways of the economy. Built trust.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I think the key here is not to let one giant to emerge, but to allow organic replicas to provide similar offers in their environments, without overarching the whole globe with a great huge fix. If the efforts remain decentralized, scattered, but also adapted to local needs and problems, I can't see a way in which this model would be bad (of course. pharmaceutical companies and other parties interested in ridiculing anything's that out of the system will try to fight it and there will be a need of great success stories that can be told to the people in order to change their attitudes towards alternative approaches to care. Maybe it's not even too late, herbal medicine didn't completely disappear...) or harmful.

Your way to do so is the donation model. The Helliniko crowd\'s is the refuse to incorporate.\xa0What different ways have in common is this: they build trust and style these services as community-driven, and the communities as the owners. They also sidestep regulation, perceived as stifling. <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/teirdes">@teirdes</a>\xa0and <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/markomanka">@markomanka</a> are full of stories on why this perception is at least partially correct. <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/lakomaa">@Lakomaa</a> could probably offer additional insights.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Such\xa0radical thinking frees up creativity and enable bottom-up emergence of more care in society.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>However, it also means you guys are very vulnerable. Noemi is right on the money: if an "Uber for health" were to emerge, it would be sued into a smoking hole at the first signs of scaling. Which makes me think that\xa0<em>not</em>\xa0scaling is a better solution for survivability of open care: sueing thousands of small initiatives is harder and more costly than going for the one Uber. Hmmm.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>But Noemi is proposing regulation as some kind of shelter for these initiatives. Would this work? To a first approximation, I am doubtful. Uber has access to legal advice, and they undoubtedly ran checks on their model before going live. But then they get sued. The sueing party claims that something in that model should be interpreted like something else already in the legal system. For example "an Uber driver is like the employee of a taxi company" or "if you rent out your spare room on Airbnb you become a hotel". If it wins the case (as it tends to do), then the sentence becomes a precedent. European version: lobbyists get the law change the way they want it. So, these innovative, disintermediating solutions start off as legal, but then they are made illegal as they begin scaling.\xa0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>All of which is pretty depressing, I must admit.

Which didn\'t change the fact that even if they had theoretically more time to spend on approaching me as a patient, they would mostly limit their help to examination and writing a prescription. Rarely they bother talking to me and try to figure out the reasons for the problem. It happened a lot with dermatologists, who basically just give you a prescription for some external treatment, very expensive, and ask you to try it out.

I guess an inhumane amount of patients to see every day might be one of the reasons.

Because most doctors work in <em>systems</em> which are not humane at all \u2013 and can\'t be, because they run on an industrial age paradigm.

This is important.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Problem for cities in europe is that they aren't designed to have multifunctional public spaces. It is starting to shift, but it is still a long way to go. in Brussels for exemple you can't BBQ anywhere but in your garden, that makes it difficult because gardens are becoming something more rare when people are starting to live in smaller and smaller spaces. So yes there needs to be a new regulation. I know for Brussels what could help is people hacking the system in big number, the legislation almost always follows up then. But you have to know how to play media and politics before, so it isn't easy for newcomers to have that background. Having a guide of succesful tests could be usefull yes.

I like how you narrowed a generic problem down to a specific one (integrate the interactive food customs / traditions).\xa0</p>\n\n<p>It may be harder than just writing a step-by-step guide to starting a street food activity and translating it into several languages.\xa0I do not know Germany well, but in Italy the regulatory landscape is a lot tighter than what seems to go for Asian markets (eg Thailand). The moment you start serving food to the public, you need to comply with licensing, safety,\xa0hygiene regulations. Additionally, many market operate a fixed number of stalls: you cannot just add a food cart as you would in other parts of the world. All of this increases the fixed costs of starting an activity. Every year, as the summer comes and festival season kicks in, the police braces to fight off illegal hawkers (who are, for the most part, just people trying to make a living, many of them migrants). The legal ones are very vocal in demanding that the police shuts down their competitors on fairness grounds ("we have to comply with all these expensive regulations, whereas these guys just go gray economy").\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In passing: within Europe there are already subastantial regulatory differences. I live in Belgium, and here tiny restaurants with toilets in the basements, that you access through narrow and steep stairs, are very common.

Given that attention is a limited resource [...] care [...]\xa0is [also]\xa0a diffuse but limited resource.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>This vision of care activities reminds me of Wikipedia. Wikipedia is quite a coherent object. It\'s also very decentralized\xa0in scope and\xa0authorship; and tasks are allocated across contributors by self-selection, without central control.</p>\n\n<p>Contributors are extremely diverse in their interests, experience, and in the time they contribute to Wikipedia. Some Wikipedians, like me, might fix a typos or repair a broken link here or there, and only very occasionally enter a factual information. Others take full stewardship for entries\xa0that are important to them. Others, still, make tens of edits a day. A lot of Wikipedia\'s advantage comes from the fact that it can use effectively\xa0<em>small</em>\xa0contributions.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Open care might be the same. A mature open care ecosystem, I propose, is one where the natural human impulse to care and help can be easily translated into a contribution. One, in other words, where, if you can only contribute 30 minutes, you can, and your contribution will make a small, but tangible difference.

I will just focus on the questions to the peers.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Sustainability can be achieved by any of the mechanisms you mentioned, and more (how about connecting a parallel currency to your activity, creating a membership parallel economy, the likes of Sardex?)... However, the key is that sustainability is not something that can be described in general terms. One has to map the entirety of value chain, and interfaces to surrounding ecosystems, to form an idea of how to become sustainable.</p></li>\n<li><p>Again, much depends on what are the incumbents you are talking about, case by case (2 hospitals will react very differently, because their governance is managed by different individuals... even if the general administration may look the same), and by how much, and what kind of, intersection your activities have with theirs... Identifying a few "ambassadors", people that may even be critical but willing to engage and discuss, on both sides (also within your own community) is possibly the first step... verbal communication is easier than written, and maps or other interpretable/symbolic representations can help confronting the different narratives to converge... I would avoid interfacing two different communities by exchanging long texts first <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p></li>\n<li><p>In your case I am not sure why you would like to "work around" any of this... maybe a specific case could help me focusing on a pragmatic reply. In general demonstrating a solid, well thought-of scheme of access to information, education/training, mentoring, and peer evaluation, helps convincing that the operations are sensible and aligned with the purposes of the law. However, there are many details one should consider only on a specific plan: what safety nets are needed for you and your community?

We have been talking about autonomy in a health care context mostly influenced by <a href="http://digg.com/2016/amish-medicine-mosaic">this article</a> about the Amish and their community-based approach to health care. The article is striking on many levels. They use the word "autonomy" in the sense of "a state of\xa0<em>not</em>\xa0having to be coupled with the world at large in a way we find troubling." Some people in Edgeryders uphold a similar concept, dependency reduction.</p>\n\n<p>Its implications are manifold (I have made a short summary <a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/a-challenge-on-autonomy-in-care/5636">here</a>, but I would recommend reading the whole article if you have not done it already). But basically, it comes down to emphasizing prevention. Illness is not only bad for the individual, it is a burden for the community. You don\'t want that, so you try to take responsibility for your health. You adopt a healthy lifestyle: you still might get sick, but at least you\'ll have down your best, and you will know that the community knows. This is close to your own attitude, if I understand this right.</p>\n\n<p>Which brings me to a question: wellness, exercise, nutrition\xa0are the low hanging fruit, the place where you are likely to get most results per unit of effort. Why not stick to them? Why struggle with licenses and regulatory hurdles?</p>\n\n<p>And again: you mention sustainability, and well you should. Are your <em>present</em> activities sustainable?

They\u2019re aim was to develop an affordable solution to improve the lives of people. aims to promote inclusion and improve the mobility of disabled people with limited resources from developing countries, where only a minority of those in need of wheelchairs has access to them.</p>\n\n<p>The DIY Wheelchair isn\u2019t a product, but a toolkit with assembly instructions\xa0that can be downloaded and a video demonstration\xa0which lends the user to use their own resources in the region to\xa0\xa0assemble the chair.\xa0It\u2019s a start.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are challenges of an affordable design. This type of open design has some drawbacks, since it lets users alone. Without a support network including designers, for the\xa0ergonomics to be satisfied and, users could use badly the instructions or not use them at all.

At the time, of course, there was no Internet: PEN was a civic network accessible locally. SHWASHLOCK is the first public service designed on a computer network that I know of.</p>\n\n<p>Santa Monica\'s libraries had terminals connected to the PEN, and some homeless residents\xa0were using the libraries. This is how homeless and homed residents were able to come to share a common hangout, and design together a simple, but very useful service.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that online spaces are quite good at removing some of\xa0the social markers that make interaction across social groups so awkward (and more power to you, <span class="mention">@Laurent_d</span>\'Ursel , for overcoming that awkardness!).

Although, at the moment it's still quite challenging for politicians here in Belgium to change the cultural mindset of opening up to public/private/citizen partnerships. Hence why some initiatives have been at grass roots level with the community itself. I sincerely hope this will change over time.</p>\n\n<p>I have linked to many of the UK BIDs and they have been incredibly supportive. Also, recently in Edinburgh there was the World Towns Leadership Summit, in which one of the organizers was BIDs Scotland along with IDA of Northern America. It was incredible to hear the stories of what some of the partnerships had indeed achieved in their communities. From Capetown to Copenhagen, it was quite an eye opener.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I hope you don't mind if I reach out to you, with your experience and knowledge of the BIDs in your area in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again!\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Rozina\xa0</p>", u'post_id': 716, u'date': u'2016-08-17 11:33:26'}, {u'user_id': 2569, u'title': u'Hello Rozina,\n\nThank you for sharing the story with ', u'comment_id': 7852, u'content': u'<p>Hello Rozina,</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for sharing the story with us. It seems that you have many great ideas about how to improve your local community.</p>\n\n<p>I have much experiene of the BID structure myself as my home town of Bedford in the UK was one of the first to adopt the structure and my father was the Director of the Board for many years before standing down last year.</p>\n\n<p>From a personal note we found that the local council/politicians were very happy to engage with and promote the work of the BID, but that it is wise to steer clear of encouraging them to run the projects. Partly this is because it is better being held in the hands of a non-party-alligned group of individuals. The main reason is that most politicians do not want to be seen to be increasing the taxation of local businesses. Because the BID system frequently\xa0demands that local businesses pay an annual subsidy or charge, if it is administered by the city then it is automatically seen by the citizens as a stealth business tax.</p>\n\n<p>It is much better for the BID groups to be politically autonomous and to save the time and energy of local politicians and civil servants. This way you get to use that time and energy on BID directed outcomes, rather than them spending it all in discussion and meetings. It really does help get things moving!</p>\n\n<p>I wish you all the best for you other initiatives too.

Transforming patients (or their closest carers) into makers is an interesting perspective. We know from citizen science that this first hands involvement often offers a stimulus to personal studies, and reflection about the identity of the problem, and the problem holder. One could argue this is an even more important potential benefit than the access to the devices in itself.</p>\n\n<p>However, an important reflection should happen about quality and safety. If one cannot bring a simple solution to the market because of the iters for safety and quality certification, and this we agree is bad, the solution should not be "ok, let\'s ignore this step and bypass it".</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of issues here. 1st and foremost, one has to describe how safety and quality are reasonably assured, and what safety net would be put in place should something still happen (although we know they are not perfect, to use an euphemism, today a number of tools and services exist to cover for assistance, accidents\' costs, etc on the side of providers).</p>\n\n<p>Of course, one could ignore this. Depending on the IP scheme, no safety nets would be needed (although it would nice to think of them), for example. But this brings us to a second issue, one that\xa0is almost\xa0"ethical": transforming every patient in a maker can leverage the citizen-scientist effect only if (this is presented as\xa0gut feeling here, but I am open to discuss it in depth later)\xa0the right IP scheme is adopted. And only if radical openness is adopted one can truly claim no responsibility over the final "accidents" that will always happen (only that which does not work, will not break).\xa0Should the creator preserve control of the IP for itself, one will always find a court that will consider the business model "exploitative", and enforce the order to establish the aforementioned safety nets (there is an interesting case about a fire happend in an AirBnB apartment that touches on this topic)... falling back to the problem one wanted to work around, just a bit later.</p>\n\n<p>So, what would be the general ecosystem\' services that would keep this garden grow orderly? I don\'t see this answered (that\'s not an easy one,\xa0indeed)</p>\n\n<p>Research, and "citizen science", target the pioneers and early adopters... To scale beyond that, we need to think the entire ecosystem, and be humble.</p>\n\n<p>For the sake of our understanding, let me be pedant and allow me to stress that\xa0disabilities do not exist in silos. People have many things going on in their lives, and around them, of course also the disabled ones. They do not stop living when they change status.\xa0A few will want to pioneer, some will want to have new solutions, some others will not want any because... I am not sure they need a "because".</p>\n\n<p>I would like to not dig too deep in the question about why the current "solutions" are often not marketed/offered... just for the sake of reasoning together: if you had a clue about how to build an engine, and it would work once every 100 attempts after serious tinkering... would you be able to market it? Let\'s be honest with ourselves and remember that researchers are very optimistic people (I belong to the category, so this is self-criticism). They will produce proof of concepts, hardly ever demonstrators (although they usually confuse the terminology), and they don\'t normally ask themselves questions like "how long will this work continuously?", "what will be the safety mechanism once it turns off, as instance because of battery exhaustion?", how many scenarios are realistically recapitulated in the lab I used for the tests, and how well does this solution generalize?",...</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s not dive in the argument of healthcare provision on this topic. Sometimes it is the right reflection to face, some other it is populistic... In these circumstances it reminds of the sentence I have recently read on twitter "being poor means having too much end of the month"... it may steal a smile, but it\'s a classic example of ill-posedness. You will not solve poverty by trying to shorten the calendar.</p>', u'post_id': 516, u'date': u'2016-08-08 10:37:26'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'I hope Eirini reads this', u'comment_id': 19857, u'content': u'<p>It just occured to me that <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/eirinimal">@eirinimal</a> could be interested in this piece on resistance to cheap hitech assistive devices.

The whole social cohesion industry is based on the notion of "vulnerable groups". People belong to such groups if they bear the markers of some kind of disadvantage, for example the dark (or light) skin of an ethnic minority, or a physical or mental disability. Belonging to vulnerable groups can be temporary: for example, there is a group called "the unemployed", thought to merit special care, even though no one is born into this group.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Like many people around here, I dislike the notion. There are two problems:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Labelling. People are included in a "vulnerable group" by somone sticking a label on them. I am a migrant. You are a female. He is transgender. The labels are not incorrect, but they imply that my having migrated is what is important about me. When providing care, the label will be inspiring the design of the services that target me.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>"Representative agent". Once they have\xa0a group to service, care providers set up services with the average component of that group in mind. This activity misses out on the richness of human diversity, and it usually ends up mass-producing services that suck.\xa0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Right now, we are seeing the damage done by this concept in the so-called migrants issue in Europe. A Syrian doctor (or engineer, or carpenter) is labeled a refugee and stuck in a camp, where another doctor (European) will assess his health. He might be ten times more experienced than his European colleague, but he is not allowed to diagnose himself and others because \u2013 guess what \u2013 in that context he "is" a not a doctor, but\xa0a refugee.</p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/alex_levene">@Alex_Levene</a> told me a funny-heartbreaking story from The Jungle (<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/welcome-to-the-jungle-weve-got-fun-and-games/625">check out\xa0his post</a>, it\'s really interesting).

He wants to live in a place where agnosticism is common, bigotry can\'t touch him\xa0and nobody cares what you pray to. And there he is, in a refugee camp,\xa0surrounded by muslims, and everyone goes to great lengths to do everything in a way that will work for muslims. They assume that, since he is Afghan and the average afghan is muslim, he must be muslim: when in fact he is <em>persecuted</em> by muslims.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 675, u'date': u'2016-05-03 09:49:39'}, {u'user_id': 3331, u'title': u'Facts?

No one can ensure a 100% holistic approach, but you can already get a lot further by having this intention.

On the fourth floor we have access to a roof of 40m2 and also a ceiling that was renewed not that long ago, we only have some problems of mushrooms there that need to be taken care of. On the long term we hope to have complete green energy providers , solar is possible. But also trying to create a consience for not using to much energy.

I have done the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>created a top-level <code>spotTheFuture</code> term.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>created two children terms, <code>actors</code> and <code>assets</code>\xa0as category terms.

I think <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/inga_popovaite">@Inga_Popovaite</a> might have re-built the hierarchy outside OE. I will ask.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In general, however, we will not need to have a hierarchy\xa0of codes that fans out from the project. There is no need. In fact, the whole idea of OE is that the codes can be shared across projects. When you want to grab a project from the API, you will use the annotations or the contentinstead:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Grab all codes, because you are going to need them.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Grab annotations, but filter out those that have not been made by the ethnographers who are part of your team. You can combine this filtering method by</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Grab content. Now, filter out all annotations that refer to content without the scope of your project. For example, the APIs for opencare return only opencare content. OE annotations APIs will return annotations that refer to non-opencare stuff, but you can decide to filter them out.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>But in general, each ethnographer can\xa0use other ethnographer\'s annotations as a guide to finding more material on Edgeryders. For example, suppose I am coding a conversation and\xa0find people talking about debt. I might want to navigate to the "debt" code (taxonomy term) page, from there to annotations that encode "debt", and from there to the actial content where\xa0<em>other</em>\xa0ethnographers have found people talking about debt. This can be used as "parallax data" to give my research more debt.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>To enable this, codes should be "floating around", detached from specific projects and ethnographer. We will want to write guidelines for this: it\'s not so much about using a piece of software, it\'s about turning ethnography into a massively collaborative endeavour.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I made this visualization of the data model in OE, that illustrates the roles of codes and annotations.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/cbb6b2016ce777f2338ca7a234735e27426c8d2d" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cbb6b2016ce777f2338ca7a234735e27426c8d2d.jpeg" class="lightbox" title="OpenEthnographer explained.001.jpeg"><img src="https://edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/cbb6b2016ce777f2338ca7a234735e27426c8d2d_1_666x500.jpeg" width="666" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">OpenEthnographer explained.001.jpeg</span><span class="informations">1024x768 241 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>', u'post_id': 5768, u'date': u'2016-08-05 15:44:00'}, {u'user_id': 2464, u'title': u'prefix instead of ids?', u'comment_id': 14000, u'content': u'<p>Is that what you are saying?

Since text styles are not per se hierarchical, the parent term was stuck in a prefix, so that the ethnographer would see all "actors:XX" close to each other in the style menu (only ethnographers would see these text styles, normal users could not see them).\xa0</p>\n\n<p>What it comes down to is: we have two possibilities. Either we rearrange the taxonomy, creating parent codes (in this case: "actors"),\xa0<em>and then</em>\xa0assign all codes of type "actors:XX" to be children of those parents; or we just ignore this stuff and generate fresh codes. Unfortunately, as we discussed. to generate fresh data we need some coding work on OE...\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Tomorrow I will assess how much work I need to do to restructure STF codes.

This way, they are making patients into caregivers (because patients cook too!) and even inventing a new shared\xa0language whith which doctors and patients can talk about health.\xa0"We are not talking about nutrition: we are talking about food."\xa0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="L0vWLn0lU5k" data-youtube-title="Cooking up culinary medicine" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>', u'post_id': 33739, u'date': u'2016-04-25 08:49:00'}, {u'user_id': 8, u'title': u'Can you make it to one of the OPENandChange workshops?', u'comment_id': 19768, u'content': u'<p>We\'re building the collective bid for the MacArthur Foundation\'s 100 million dollar grant with peers in several countries and I think you should be in it\xa0<span>\xa0</span><span>\xa0</span> <a href="http://tour.openandchange.care">http://tour.openandchange.care</a></p>', u'post_id': 5117, u'date': u'2016-08-07 09:28:19'}, {u'user_id': 8, u'title': u'Was too early at the time, but maybe shoot for a fellowship?', u'comment_id': 16500, u'content': u'<p>Hi Laura,</p>\n\n<p>I had managed to miss this as we were in deep preparation mode ahead of launching OpenCare.

Pre-welfare states (19th century), welfare was basically invented by European mutual assistance societies, in turn part of the workers\' movement. I imagine that, in the early days, these societies were small enough that the choice of treating someone would visibily drain the common pool of resources. So, in those days, maybe European factory workers thought a bit more like the Amish. A modern-day version of that, though I only know anecdotes about it, is implemented by <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/lasindias">@lasindias</a> .\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I think autonomy\xa0is also an interesting scenario in terms of policy, and fits well into <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/lakomaa">@Lakomaa</a> \'s and <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/tino_sanandaji">@Tino_Sanandaji</a> \'s institutional economics framework.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>My summary from the article:\xa0</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The Amish refuse to have insurance. "When someone gets sick, the church collects alms to help the patient cover expenses."</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>This might happen at a time when the community has other objectives as well ("setting up a farm for a young couple"). You can ask of the community to support your treatment, but its\xa0costs are not simply discharged into an anonymous "system": they are borne by your own brothers and sisters. As a result, everyone focuses on not spending more money than is necessary, and\xa0"[Amish] communities are highly interested in health education and disease prevention".</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>For this reason, the Amish use genetic screening of children. Prevention is so important that its benefits trump the disadvantages of dealing with the world at large.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>They develop their own treatments (one for burns is described in the article). They navigate, with some difficulties, the interface with the mainstream medical world: clinical testing etc. These treatments tend to be very cheap.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Communities negotiate discounts, which hospitals are willing to offer in exchange for payment in full at the time of service. In one example (a child treated with surgery for colon cancer) price was negotiated down to 19,000 USD from 172,000, a 90% discount. "For Americans with health insurance, it may come as a surprise that hospital costs are negotiable".\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The Amish don\'t sue. "When the Amish told [a doctor]\xa0they understand doctors are human and make mistakes, he had to pause to let that sink in. To them, he was not simply a member of the medical establishment, but an autonomous individual doing his best, given the choices and information before him."\xa0</li>\n\n</ul>', u'post_id': 713, u'date': u'2016-08-06 08:24:25'}, {u'user_id': 8, u'title': u'Not only in the US but also closer to home', u'comment_id': 6704, u'content': u'<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/lasindias">@lasindias</a> has some recent experience of something similar.

As Glenn described it a subgroup in the Occupy movement decided that they would focus their energy on teaching themselves, and others,\xa0to become self-reliant communities. They do this through a kind of structured learning program along tracks, when we spoke they were just about to start building the health track.

However, the number of appointments one\xa0can have with them\xa0is very limited. Getting a place in therapy is difficult. There are annoying regulations in order to get the insurance to cover it.

Like some here already intuit, meaningful help can come from\xa0supportive community environments (interesting examples from a\xa0town in Belgium called Geel where families host "patients" for decades!, or\xa0housing sites in NYC with 40% mentally ill people living among the others).</p>\n\n<p>A key takeaway for me personally is this: in a lot of cases what breaks how we think about mental illness is the belief\xa0that it needs to be fixed, that patients\xa0need to go back to some initial state of wellbeing;\xa0families, through proximity and attachment,\xa0are\xa0most prone to exemplify this in the daily lives of someone recovering after treatment -\xa0through a way of expressing emotions like 1) criticism 2) hostility 3) emotional overinvolvement. The mechanisms seem complex (can be subtleties, or\xa0just body language..), but it turns out that\xa0all 3 point to how difficult it is for family to accept and empathize,\xa0and only load too much pressure on the person in question.\xa0Strangers, on the other hand, do not really care THAT much and can be better healers because they "don\'t see you as a bundle of problems that need to be fixed".\xa0</p>\n\n<p>But: they do become kind of like a second family, so not complete strangers after all.</p>\n\n<p>I looked up some of the original studies attesting psychocultural effects on mental recovery - <a href="http://anthro.ucsd.edu/_files/Faculty%20Files/Jenkins/1991Anthropology,%20Expressed%20Emotion,%20and%20Schizophrenia..pdf">pdf here.</a></p>\n\n<p>Highly recommended.</p>', u'post_id': 677, u'date': u'2016-07-07 11:19:13'}, {u'user_id': 3253, u'title': u'Emotional Health', u'comment_id': 12885, u'content': u"<p>I think the wording is a good point.

Our vision is to bring more transparency and education in food supply chains and the market, thus empowering all actors involved to become real game players. New technologies and\xa0open data systems are proving to be really strong allies, allowing for more personalised service, more market awareness and more efficiency, without having to sacrifice the taste quality and cultural story of food and its territory, in the name of "competitiveness".\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The producers we work with are the real actors at the bottom. If they provide us with the right tools to work (<em>eg.\xa0</em>good quality, nutritiouts ingredients), then we are able to pass them over to talented chefs, who become themselves storytellers of these foods and their territories.

I see a strong similiarity with the <a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/when-do-you-decide-that-running-from-a-failed-medical-system-is-no-longer-an-option/652">cytostatic network story</a> in Romania, though I know less of it.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>No point discussing why these are care stories, that\'s self-evident. It makes more sense to discuss why they are open.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>They are open in the trivial sense\xa0that they are not constructed on intellectual property rights.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>They are open in the sense that people can freely decide to step in and become a part of it. There is not even a real vetting process: the Helliniko clinic works by asking people to volunteer for a group, so that which individuals are paired with which group is driven by self selection. As for the cytostatic network, I guess that came down to people phoning up and saying "hey, I\'m flying to Bucharest next week, do you want me to carry anything?". Implication: the people who are most likely to step in are the people who themselves need to use the system. The community serves itself.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>They are open in the sense that coordination and management\xa0processes are relatively fluid. People coordinate using minimal tech and whatever works (Google Groups in the case of Helliniko). This is in stark contrast to,\xa0for example, Airbnb or Uber, where every user and every provider interact in exactly the same ways, and these ways are encoded in the affordances of the respective platforms.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Maybe they are also open in the sense that the range of what gets done (or doesn\'t) is not written in stone, but emerges as a function of opportunity, motivation of people on the ground and perceived need. For example, Helliniko does not do the same things a hospital does: it does not do surgery, and it has no beds \u2013 it does less than hospitals here, because covering this need would increase complexity by an order of magnitude. Neither does it do first aid, because Greeks have a right to first aid even if they are long-term unemployed. On\xa0the other hand, Helliniko hands out free pharmaceuticals and even non-medical stuff like baby formula or food for (poor) people with food intolerances. So they do\xa0<em>more</em>\xa0than hospitals here.\xa0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>When all is said and done,\xa0<em>everything</em>\xa0in these stories is constantly renegotiated: the means, the teams, the actions. Except one thing: the people being served. In the Helliniko story, this is the local folks who have lost access to public health care. In the cytostatic network, it\'s cancer patients and their families, who cannot get hold of certain pharmaceuticals. The service is built around their needs.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Finally: these two stories are exemplar also in the sense that they can use small contibutions, like Wikipedia (as argued <a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/collaborative-care-a-new-generation-of-services/464/2">here</a>). You can help Helliniko even just putting word out on social media when the clinic needs a certain medicine, or the cytostatic network just by puntting a couple of boxes of medicines into your suitcase when flying to Romania. This does not make them more open, but it does make them better at taking advantage of being open.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 5721, u'date': u'2016-06-16 13:25:28'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'Location and time', u'comment_id': 10468, u'content': u'<p>I\'m in and looking forward to it.

The project (not the EU funded one, "the" project) can be thought of as a lifelong journey. The EU funded project is a vehicle you use at some point to speed up your travel from point A to point B, hoping it will fuel your "project" to help get where you want to go.</p>\n\n<p>"Two things" probably sounds differentyl to you.

It is very true that a EU project\xa0is two things, and this not only for us but for everyone, at least in theory. It is its own thing: a project with a pulse, practices, a management structure, rules etc. It is also a stepping stone to wherever its partners want to go. There are some organizations that treat EU funded research as a market, and see themselves as active in this market. They do projects just to do projects. From what I hear, the Commission is not happy about this at all, because the lack of ambition of these organizations translates into a lack of impact of EU taxpayer money poured into research.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the EC is a rule-based organization. Therefore, we do need to tick all the boxes. This leads to running two projects at once: one is, as you say, institutional and funded, and it will end on December 31st 2017. The other one is\xa0entrepreneurial and not funded, and it will live on or not. The two share some activities.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The activities most central to the entrepreneurial side of the project should, wherever possible, overdeliver.\xa0We committed to delivering 1,000 pieces of content (posts + comments) by the end of the year. We are already over 1,500 \u2013 no problem for the institutional project, the box is ticked. But for the entrepreneurial project, we would love to overshoot the goal: get to 3-4,000.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>How is this achieved? By mobilizing people. ER is committed to mobilizing its own community (broadly intended). We believe this is, for us, the best use of our limited communication resources. And it\'s working out, given that most of 113 people who have contributed content to OC so far come from that direction. But everyone else is more than welcome to go fish for people and content in other spaces. We appreciate they may require different communication styles \u2013 even different philosophies of engagement. <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/costantino">@Costantino</a> says "user experience works", and he is right. <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> says "people are interested in people and their stories, not in websites", and she, too, is right.\xa0I have no problem with any of that \u2013 it probably means that Costa can reach out to a crowd that will react to Ux, and No to one that will react to stories. So, it makes sense that Costa is free to build a landing page he likes, and No to share links pointing directly to individual challenge responses.

I personally believe digital media not to be so good at solving the discussion we are entering. Why not put that at the agenda in June and make it an item to be discussed by the steering committe meeting. If June is too far away, let\'s make it a closed, official, mandatory meeting\xa0with\xa0steering committee members.]</p>\n\n<p>I encourage everyone to appreciate the efforts made to come up with these recommendations. That being said, Alberto is absolutely right: part of it is\xa0a political compromise. I personally would use the term "institutional".</p>\n\n<p>IDENTITY. On the identity side, the recommendations are right: for now, the use of different spelling is confusing. I agree with Zoe with the fact that the "3" is geek habit and can hinder our will to engage with "ordinary" people. The use by others of similar names, in similar context, has to be taken into account. This must be clarified and I am confident we will find a viable solution.</p>\n\n<p>NOT ONE, BUT TWO COHABITING PROJECTS. The situation also partly holds to the fact that there are two projects running in parallel and mixing together. The institutional, funded, partly academic\xa0one\xa0partners engaged into; and the one promised to live long after the EU initiative and run by EdgeRyders -- I admit it took me some time to realize this. And in fact, the EU initiative was triggered by EdgeRyders\' fantastic capability to have people and\xa0ideas come together and great project emerge.</p>\n\n<p>LANDING PAGE.\xa0I am ready to comply with the experts and designers advice on the use/design of single/multiple\xa0landing page(s), etc. I guess one main issue is that the EU project and partners of this EU initiative are simply\xa0non visible on the actual websites (the pages hosted on the edgeryders porta). And this is a problem that must not be too easily discarded/ignored. I hear this sounds dramatically narcissic, but hey, academia lives on recognition and visibility\xa0-- that\'s what fuels the funds we will be able to get the next time we run a tender. That\'s what fuels the whole of academia, from the baseline researchers to the top institutionals in the organizational chart.\xa0I believe it might\xa0just be the same with non-academic partners that nevertheless mostly live on public funds.</p>\n\n<p>A distinct landing page looked like a good compromise to satisfy all these (narcissic)\xa0expectations. This distinct landing page is not\xa0about moving or having people meet, it has other "intitutional" aims, that are not addressed by the actual setting.</p>\n\n<p>SOCIAL MEDIA. What I hear from Alberto is that trafic anyway takes place on EdgeRyders accounts. That bringing trafic to these other "opencare" accounts is a lot of work -- I hear he asks whether we (and who?) are ready to put the efforts to keep these accounts alive. So the question is (asked to the steering committee?): do we want/need these "institutional" channels, and if so are we ready to invest the necessary resources?</p>\n\n<p>A question is asked about the relevancy of having a G+ channel (devoted to videos, from what I understood). Again, to be accepted,\xa0the answer must take the dual nature of opencare into account.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, that comment is far too long already.

As a consequence, the use of digits should be avoided as it resonates as some geekness or weirdness to some. This has a number of consequences as discussed below.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>A series of channels have been identified (some new, some less new) and could be used in the following manner:\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Keep using the <span class="mention">@op3ncare</span> <strong>twitter </strong>login account but associate it with the opencare name. An existing twitter account already uses the <span class="mention">@opencare</span> login; other accounts use names similar but distinct from opencare (OpenCARE, Open Care with a blank space). This would make the already existing <span class="mention">@op3care</span> twitter account compatible with the opencare name spelling.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>This is already the case with the <strong>Facebook</strong> account pointing the op3ncare page (login) seen under the name opencare. We are not saying this Facebook account should only be used for research related stuff, we are suggesting it can comply with the above recommendations.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p></p>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Registration of these names has not been identified as urgent.

We have something we can replace categories with: frequency distributions. Instead of saying "we need to accommodate the disabled" we can say "3% of humans cannot go up more than one step, and the step needs to be lower than 200 millimeters".

Do we make him his own species?</p>\n\n<p>\xa0Darwin said "look, a species is simply a frequency distribution across certain characteristics. For example, most ants do not have wings, but some (males) do. About 98% (I\'m making the number up here) of humans walk on two legs, but a 2% does not."

What I mean by this is: the simplest the "device", the more the ways in which it can be used, the broader the range of abilities it accommodates. Take, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticine">plasticine</a>:</p>\n\n<p><img src="http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/content/filerepository/RES/00/001/755/RES00001755-L.JPG" width="231" height="188"></p>\n\n<p>You can do all sorts of stuff with it, from just playfully messing around to veritable art. So, in a way it is perfectly inclusive. But if\xa0you ever tried to play with plasticine with someone else, you know that disabilities are by no means the only important differentiator: children of different ages, for example, will want to do different things with plasticine. Everyone likes it (it is accessible for everyone), but it does not necessarily bring people <em>together</em>. It appears that accessibility does not lead per se to socialization.</p>\n\n<p>Your response might be to design in such a way as to restrict the ways to interact with the artefact. For example, there are not many things you can do with\xa0a merry-go-round (though children do try!). But then, you risk overdetermining the interaction, making your work uninteresting for everyone!\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Hmm, interesting problem!

Healthcare in Europe has been a forerunner in developing new drugs and medical care to create the healthiest and longest-living society. But it comes at a huge cost. Countries throughout the European Union are looking at new ways of reforming the way healthcare is provided. Is community driven healthcare an option?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Discover \u201cOpenCare\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p>OpenCare, the first online community driven project that addresses the social aspects of healthcare. This project is structured to re-design care services in a more sustainable way, taking advantage of the scattered collective knowledge of individuals and communities, then sharing it to improve the well-being of others. This open-to-all knowledge approach to care is the heartbeat of OpenCare with the intention to explore the conditions for communities to design and deliver their own healthcare services.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Positive Disruption</strong></p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s time for positive disruption in health care, and in care services in general. Why? With the health costs on the rise, the system is under strain, and often, it reacts by denying care to those who need it most. This is morally unacceptable.\xa0 When the Metropolitan Community Clinic at Helliniko as well as many others, in the world of care has proven how much farther communities can go in taking care of their members when they are enabled to do it. This is a unique health care approach. It is regulated off the grid, run by volunteers, does not accept money and operates with no management. Time to challenge, engage and create alternative solutions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Expected Outcomes</strong></p>\n\n<p>The OpenCare initiative is expected to help understand how to use the collective intelligence of communities concerning sustainable development and to explore community-driven healthcare. Edgeryders has partnered up with five world-class organisations in research University of Bordeaux, Stockholm School of Economics, ScimPulse Foundation, and City of Milan and WeMake to find, learn from, and enhance the experiences like the clinic in Hellinko all around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Their goal is a model of community-driven care services, based on modern science, open technology, low overhead and human touch that communities can provide, while large bureaucracies cannot.

Health insurance is expensive, calling an ambulance is expensive, there is always a long waiting in the hospital, and including what you mentioned--actions not being done to avoid suing. While in China, many problems are associated with lack of law enforcements and disrespect between people.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I will let you know if I find anything interesting.</p>', u'post_id': 496, u'date': u'2016-06-01 23:19:47'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Fascinating!', u'comment_id': 21878, u'content': u'<p>Wow, thanks <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/lujia">@lujia</a>, this is really good insight. I had no idea this stuff was going on in China.</p>\n\n<p>I am particularly interested in the conflictual relationship between doctors and patients. This could be a very serious drag on the system. Liability laws, even when they are well-meaning, end up disincentivizing doctors to intervene, especially on cases that are serious and desperately need help. One of my uncles, a gynaecologist in New York, once told me that his liability insurance was far and away his highest cost, and that patients would sue for absolutely anything. In America, you can sue for astronomically high sums, because they have a legal insititution called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punitive_damages">punitive damage</a>. If somebody causes you trouble, you can sue not only to recover the costs of the damage done, but also to "punish" the offender. Punishment depends on subjective evaluation of the offense, i.e. on\xa0how deeply you have been made unhappy by the offense: the more unhappy, the more money you can demand. Unsusrprisingly,\xa0\xa0most people say they are\xa0<em>very</em>\xa0unhappy, and demand a lot of money.</p>\n\n<p>In this situation, he explained,\xa0if you see a woman with a potentially troubled pregnancy, you\'d better stay the hell away from her. If you try to treat her and she or the baby have issues, she\'ll sue you into a smoking hole. But if you don\'t touch her, then you are good. Of course,\xa0<em>she</em>\xa0might suffer from lack of treatment, and that\'s too bad but not really your problem. But doctors, mostly, choose this career because they want to heal patients, so some (including my uncle) buy expensive insurance and carry on.\xa0Eventually the premiums rose so high that he just decided to go out of business. In Europe, this problem is less exacerbated, also because\xa0we do not have punitive damage.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>What is the situation like in China? Can you tell us more about these "professionals"? Do you know of any community-based responses, like <a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care-system/4880">this one</a> in Greece?\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 496, u'date': u'2016-04-24 10:25:47'}, {u'user_id': 3265, u'title': u"An Insider's View", u'comment_id': 20163, u'content': u'<p>Hi Pauline,\xa0</p>\n\n<p>First of all, I am very happy to know that one of my classmates has been to my country and lived there for so long! Secondly, please trust me when I say I totally understand how much trouble and frustration you and your family might have faced. I have studied in the USA for over six years now, and it was very difficult for me in the beginning. However, at least America is organized and has more serious regulations. On the other hand, China is this crazy place with things that I don\'t even know how they work XD.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The healthcare system and medicine and food safety are two of the most serious issues that is occuring in China right now (along with hundreds of other ones...). If you think about it, China is a country that is both old and young. Modern medicine, science, social structure, and etc didn\'t become a thing until very recent in the history. The China now was established in 1949, and after that the country went through a four-year famine and a ten-year cultural revolution. By the beginning of 1980s, the entire country was behind\xa0on technology, education\xa0and many other things. Medicine --\xa0a\xa0crucial area \xa0-- unfortunately brought harm to many people due to the doctors\' lack of professional knowledge. Many people in my generation, including one of my best friends, suffer hearing loss because of\xa0antibiotics over-use. I have a permenant\xa0arm injury myself because of the improper obstetrics practice.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Today, the relationship between the doctors and the patients are super intense in China. The patients\xa0and their families\xa0would blame everything on the doctors and the hospitals if they think they are not treated "correctly". There are even groups of so called "professionals" who are paid by the patients\' families to make a mess at the hospital: break things and even physically harm the doctors.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I am not quite sure exactly how this works, but it seems to me that Chinese doctors like giving the patients all kinds of pills. It is very common in China to see a doctor just for a common cold, and you would recieve medicine for that\xa0(I\xa0never took anything when I was sick in America). People say that the doctors recieve benefits from giving medicine, but don\'t mark my words on this. I can definetly do more research later.\xa0And then, there is the question of how safe\xa0the drugs and vaccine in some places are. But I\'m afraid that is out of my knowledge.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I\'m not sure if any of this information is helpful. But one thing for sure, it is not just because you and your family are foreigners that getting a treatment is confusing and frustrating, it is becasue the entire system is a mess, even for locals like me.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Lujia</p>', u'post_id': 496, u'date': u'2016-04-24 02:50:16'}, {u'user_id': 8, u'title': u'Yes I think Alex, Yara and Mousab might know?', u'comment_id': 18415, u'content': u'<p>ping <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/alex_levene">@Alex_Levene</a> , <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/yara_al_adib">@Yara_Al_Adib</a> , <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/mousab_alshikh">@Mousab_Alshikh</a> \xa0...maybe you have some experience dealing with Belgian institutions around health stuff?</p>', u'post_id': 496, u'date': u'2016-05-13 13:27:17'}, {u'user_id': 3253, u'title': u'Hi Alberto,\n\nsorry for taking so long to reply.

Then the bigger group of religion and even bigger group of race. We have been conditioned to think in certain patterns (mostly as means of control and achieving power by few) and great majority of people don\'t have time/will to question all those things. Not even counting that, just take into consideration collective history, how many bad past experiences have their been? We Europeans have destroyed and dominated every other culture we encountered in our "benign\xa0attempts to civilise them"(if we had means to do so). All those things are big obstacles, it will take a loooooong time i believe before we undo several thousands of years working against us.</p>\n\n<p>The only way to truly build bridges between communities is to \xa0have them work together, eat together, talk and exchange knowledge about each other.

So maybe travelling inwards might solve issues as well? Asking important questions to ourselves or others like: Why do i keep distance from this person? What is the origin of my fear, mistrust, why am i judgemental? Again, how does one accept the idea that he/she is wrong in some fundamental ways?

Those people managed to see the tail end of the noncommercial Internet; and they remember what it means for using a website to to be "hard": slow dialup connections, textual interfaces, floppy disks with vintage browsers like Mosaic and Netscape. These people make good online collaborators; they go for content and community, and if they need to work a little harder to get it they will.

The facebook group is just one of the means/tools of the group. As a group, with the resources available for us and the main gaps identified at the national level, we focus on promotional and preventive care. We concentrate in this group, global and local evidence relevant for anyone to prevent cardiovascular diseases. \xa0 Beyond the key "theoretical" principles of WHO, we try to find out, how to raise and to support the motivation of people to change sustainably their dangerous behaviors. There is a need to find the right balance between specificity (focus on the main purpose of the group) and attractivity (diversity of topics and angle of view, pictures, news etc..) in such a way that users have a feeling of distraction while they are exposed to the key messages of prevention of CVD. I perceive that in my context, Facebook is first of all used in for distractive purposes.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The online facebook group, is not a tool for curative or palliative care such as online consultations with drug prescriptions. Medical doctors are involved in the discussions and if required, they can give offline, specific orientations to go for curative consultations; but discussions in the group, do not involve curative or palliative care.</p>\n\n<p>2- How do we collaborate? Online, each member has the right to share what matter for him, that is related to the focus of the group. This can be\xa0a question, a picture, a video, a comment etc... The use of this right of free expression in such a group is not so high everytime of the year. If you scroll down further, you will find periods of high participation \xa0on some specific subject with high interest and\xa0later some period of low or no engagement. This depends on several factors, that we are still learning about. I attach to this comment a screenshot that presents a collaborative construction of an answer to a question raised in the group. I can send to you the whole power point if you want.</p>\n\n<p>3- Dealing with the traps of facebook, how? Facebook is the social media that lot of people use in sub-Saharan\xa0Africa. The way they use it, seems to be more diversified and intensive than in Europe for instance. Other social media like twitter have a much lower audience in sub-Saharan Africa. So we use Facebook as an important collaborative platform in Coeur d\'Or, with the risks that you mentioned including spams. The facilitation team has a critical role to cure the wall of the group. This team has to approve\xa0all the primary posts, but can not approve comments before their publication. The team has, however, to be vigilant to remove all the inappropriate comments regularly. Private birthday posts are treated as not alway treated as inappropriate. We tolerate them some time for active members as a mean to reward them and to sustain their motivation to collaborate more in the group.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>4- Offline events. We realized early in our learning process in the group, that online presence alone is not going to help us reaching our goals. We organize collaboratively offline events: physical activities (walks), risk factors screening, interactive conferences and\xa0workshops. All those events are organized by members of the group. We use the online tools to recruit members who want to collaborate in the organization. We share with them some key principles and support. We use the online tools as well for advertisement of the events. The access to all the physical\xa0event is free of charge. We use a collaborative process to raise the funding, using members of the group that has skills and key positions in potential funding structures. By doing so, we were capable of raising up to 25000 dollars in 2015 to organize physical events. This is happening in a context where the ministry of health do not have any internal budget for this kind of event. The local representation of WHO makes about 2000 dollars only available for this kind of event. In the organization of those offline events, community members hold\xa0a lot of power in the process.</p>\n\n<p>We still have a lot to learn, about this experience. Thanks for your attention.

I interviewed a few people on the street who were in a wheelchair, and did a half day experiment rolling myself in a wheelchair. It was quite an experience I have to say. I suddenly\xa0found myself shorter than everyone else --\xa0both physically and psychologically. Many people offered me help, and of course I told them the truth, but I felt if I were really disabled, I wouldn\'t simply say yes because I wouldn\'t want to trouble others and\xa0would want to be as independent as possible. On the other hand, when I see a handicapped person, and a few of my classmates agreed on this, sometimes I am not sure if I should help him/her because I don\'t want to assume that they can\'t perform\xa0certain actions and offend them.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>As time goes on, I realize the unbalance in the relationship between the abled and the disabled. The abled is always the benefit provider and the disabled is always the benefit receiver. Hence, this automatically, like you mentioned, "belittled" the handicapped. Therefore I began to think some solutions that can make the disabled offer something back so that the relationship between these two group could be even. We didn\'t spend much time on this project so my answer to my question might sound cheesy.\xa0\xa0I focused on wheelchair only, and added a heart-rate monitor on the handle so that the person who pushes the wheelchair could use that\xa0time to work out.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Here is the link to the commercial I made for the product.

I used to deal with structurally similar situations, when I was the director of a government initiative\xa0supporting creative projects in Italy\'s Mezzogiorno.\xa0The Italian govt\xa0placed\xa0a high priority on enterprise/job creation in the south. We had plenty of money. And yet, the more we tried to "do it right" (we\xa0chased\xa0fledgling entrepreneurs in small villages and underprivileged areas, we put money on the table), the more we found ourselves talking to, somehow, the wrong people. Monetary incentives brought out the sharks. Targeting vulnerable groups fostered an unhealthy relationship, with the people in question assuming a dependent relationship.\xa0Reciprocal, inclusive, sure, but how?\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In practice, we ended up doing two things. They did not constitute an elegant solution, but it was a decent hack.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>We refused to hand out any money. We could, and did, point to many initiatives funding creative projects. We pointed out that, for people to want to pay for your ideas, you need to do up front work to make that idea clear and robust, and we could help with\xa0<em>that.</em>\xa0We were offering a free service, and keeping it separated from the actual funding. We did do a challenge, with a monetary reward a year. I think the small amounts in OpenCare are very much in that tradition: they signal respect, but are not big enough to distort incentives. In the startup scene, incentives are\xa0<em>very</em>\xa0distorted \u2013 there are even <a href="http://kefuturo.com/post/143586199216/startup-fallisce-allinsaputa-del-founder-era-a">jokes about it</a>. But the dark world of "incentivi alle imprese" is no joke.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>We focused on what you call "pushing" only in the very first step of the engagement process. We would go out of our way to go where the creatives (whatever that meant) met, to make ourselves available and encourage: but after that, we would allow people to self-select. The rationale is this: like my project of 2008,\xa0<em>OpenCare\xa0</em>does not need to appeal to absolutely everybody. It needs to appeal to\xa0<em>the people that build the care services</em>\xa0which, then, will appeal to everybody. The Helliniko Metropolitan Community Clinic was not dreamed up by long-term unemployed Greeks: the first mover was a senior\xa0doctor in Rhodes. The clinic itself, though, is open: not only it targets unemployed people, but it allows them to help run it.</li>\n\n</ol>', u'post_id': 5621, u'date': u'2016-05-04 11:38:50'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'Reference about the 911 adhoc response system?', u'comment_id': 6599, u'content': u'<p><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/nadia">@Nadia</a> hi!</p>\n\n<p>Curious if we have any link to the story, for further info?\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Good luck tomorrow at re:publica &lt;3</p>', u'post_id': 5618, u'date': u'2016-05-03 14:31:05'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'Caring for loved ones (Alzheimer, dementia..)', u'comment_id': 33764, u'content': u'<p>Thanks for sharing this <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/honeymk">@HoneyMk</a>, I was very impressed by Philipp\'s grandparents\xa0story (is he <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/makerphil">@makerphil</a>?), which tells things so many of us experienced, albeit not to the same degree.. my family\xa0had to take care for 5 years of my grandmother, who also suffered from dementia.</p>\n\n<p>She was lucky because she had a large family and they all shouldered this, but for the two people who lived side by side with her it was immensely difficult.

But\xa0I implore you: do not\xa0spend more than a few hours on it.\xa0When all it\'s been said and done, OpenCare <i>is</i>\xa0a difficult project.\xa0It requires\xa0<em>very active</em>\xa0participation from people. Doing landing pages might help incrementally, but will not change this situation.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Commercial design techniques are a bad match for this kind of problem, because they assume that "the user" has a 20 seconds\xa0attention span (Alberto mentioned an exact number, which might even be smaller, I forgot what it was), and requires immediate gratification. It also assumes, critically, that each "user" that walks away is a loss to the project. In a commercial setting, all of this is true, because the "user" is there to be shown advertisements.</p>\n\n<p>The OpenCare kind of stuff assumes that the "participant" is an intelligent adult, who is measuring up with a big problem and enjoys the challenge. She is not scared of ugly interfaces and even command-line ones. She understands that it will take hours of deep reflection and engagement to even make meaningful contribution, let alone solve anything. And if she is not prepared to do that, she\xa0<em>should</em>\xa0walk away. We are doing no favour to her, nor to ourselves, by keeping people engaged who do not like our terms of engagement.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>This experience, at least for me, goes back to 2008 (Costantino remembers Kublai, and that in turn stood on the shoulders of a simpler projects in 2006-2007).\xa0What I have learned is that smart, committed people gravitate to smart, committed people: that a challenging environment repels some, but signals to the others that they are being treated as thinking adults, and brings out the best in them; and that there is no way to build engagement other than handholding, seeking out actively the smartest people\xa0and leading by example \u2013 for example uploading <em>your own</em> care stories onto the platform. And\xa0<em>that\'s</em>\xa0where the bulk of your time and effort should go. Not artifacts, but process: community management and dogfooding.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, plenty of Euro projects have tried all sorts of designs and failed miserably to attract any kind of real engagement. The extent of this failure is hard to believe. It basically tanked a whole program, called E-Participation\xa0(<a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-27219-6_13#page-1">paper</a>). Meanwhile, Edgeryders \u2013 for all its faults \u2013 was avoiding these pitfalls. This is why we were mentioned as an example in the working paper by Fabrizio Sestini, the CAPS program officer, and the overall failure of E-Participation\xa0is one of the reasons\xa0why CAPS looks the way it does. I <em>really\xa0</em>do not recommend to walk the same path as the (smart, professional, motivated) people in E-Part.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 5570, u'date': u'2016-04-19 11:48:00'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Thanks!

What\'s important is that they link to the conversation website on edgeryders\xa0and attempt to bring people in, so that\xa0we\'re not putting too much effort in\xa0informative\xa0materials, but keep focusing on their engagement function. Of course, engagement can mean different things to us partners.\xa0The way I see OpenCare is that we don\'t need to speak to a general "public", there is no public. There are people who could be community members, contributors etc, and landing pages\xa0should speak to them. The way we quantify online engagement is by site visits and conversion into online activity posts and comments. One thing proposed at the call was to test these pages and measure the results after some time.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, hope you guys can agree on this.</p>', u'post_id': 5570, u'date': u'2016-04-19 12:00:24'}, {u'user_id': 3074, u'title': u'OpenCare landing page', u'comment_id': 9962, u'content': u'<p><a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/costantino?lang=nl"></a><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/costantino">@Costantino</a>\xa0/\xa0<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/zoescope?lang=nl"></a><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/zoescope">@zoescope</a>\xa0/\xa0<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/costantino?lang=nl">@</a><a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/cristina-martellosio?lang=nl">Cristina Martellosio</a> /\xa0<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/markomanka?lang=nl"></a><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/markomanka">@markomanka</a>\xa0/\xa0<span class="mention">@MassimoMercuri</span> / <a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/luciascopelliti?lang=nl"></a><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/luciascopelliti">@Luciascopelliti</a>\xa0/\xa0<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/rossana-torri?lang=nl"><span class="mention">@Rossana</span> Torri</a>\xa0/\xa0<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/lakomaa?lang=nl"></a><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/lakomaa">@Lakomaa</a>\xa0/ <a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/melancon?lang=nl"></a><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/melancon">@melancon</a> /<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/costantino?lang=nl">@</a><a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/alberto">Alberto </a>/\xa0<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/costantino?lang=nl">@</a><a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/nadia">Nadia</a> /\xa0<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/costantino?lang=nl">@</a>Noemi /\xa0<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/users/costantino?lang=nl">@</a>Moushira</p>\n\n<p>Hello everyone,\xa0</p>\n\n<p>It\'s a shame I missed this community call, because, ahem, well...

Think of this person, reading about OpenCare a week before the review (sometimes more, but reading ahead of time doesn\'t mean\xa0giving more time reviewing the project). Think of this person who wants to get information in a synthesized way, yet who wants to get a "feeling" about what\'s going on.</p>\n\n<p>So, my take is, it\'s worth to put up a short, crisp, one or two pager that gives an overview of the deliverable. That tells this person where to go on the portal and what is to find there. You guys are professionnals at communicating ideas with so much enthusiasm. I am sure you all know what I am talking about.</p>\n\n<p>I know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_flies_like_an_arrow;&lt;em&gt;fruit&lt;/em&gt;flies_like_a_banana" rel="nofollow noopener">time flies like an arrow</a>.

Plus, when letting them do the work there is a risk that they don\'t focus on the right thing -- because yes, they come with their own set of glasses, with their domain of expertise that do not necessarily fit ours a 100% percent ... and well, OpenCare is quite a unique "assemblage" of people, isn\'t it?</p>', u'post_id': 5485, u'date': u'2016-04-07 05:03:09'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u"Not sure \u2013 but here's an idea", u'comment_id': 25553, u'content': u'<p>The deliverable is the platform itself, not a report about the platform.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Here\'s a suggestion: this very wiki could serve as the documentation to that\xa0deliverable.

My home town has one of the few and the best preserved workhouse of the country. Recently there has been a bid the renovate and repurpose the space as a diaspora and geneological centre. I freely consult with the consultant on this project, a tipperary councillor named Brian Rafferty. I approached the team originally from the perspective that the heritage and true history of the situation would have to be honored if the project was to be a success and that in certain ways it must become the antidote to the perception of hardship that most people percieve it as being (and which, in all honesty, is an accurate perception of the elusive reality of that history).</p>\n\n<p>The point that was important for me to make was that the workhouses were publically announced as the first form of organized social welfare in the country. That they served a community purpose and that in the remaking of this space there should be a strong element of that social aspect. I will not get nto the injustices in Irish history here, thats not my aim at all, and yet that is not to say that I am not fully aware of the situation as it was in reality.</p>\n\n<p>I suggested to the team a number of plausable possibilities. One was that, given the proximity of the workhouse to one of the poorest housing estates in the town, that there could be a Montessori school that operates according to the social enterprise of a specified successful Dublin company who are part of the SETF (Social Enterprise Task Force) in Ireland. I also suggested, having picked spuds for local organic farmers back in the day, and having heard how they interact with the bigwigs of Tescos and SuperValue, that a local Community supported market could operate in the courtyard; that the Irish should follow the Greek Potatoe Revolution. As chance would have it</p>\n\n<p>I read yesterday on my friend Lisa\u2019s facebook that she bought a bag of organic potatoes at my formeer employers organic shop for \u20ac2 less than the supervalue equivalent. My comment in reply was \u201cCommunity supported markets, local produce, undercut Tesco, nuff said!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In addition to this the idea has been raised to me that a forest would be good to balance the atmosphere in the surrounding area. Some 3000 bodies (probably more) are buried in the fields aling the rear and side of the building. A ceremony, a tree planting, and a forest made in the fields available to the rear is an event that can give a whole community, indeed a nation, a sense of meaning, and can serve an honorary and calming purpose and service to its site and situation.</p>\n\n<p>I have spoken with Slow Food Youth Ireland and to other members of the Cloughjordan Ecovillage (where Vinay lives quite a bit \u2013 hi Vinay) aswell as to members of a volunteer/selfemployment company called Local-Switch about their possible interaction with any potential project that could come of this also. Naturally, Edgeryders came up, and Brian was vaguely interested but</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not sure that he understands the potential of the situation. He agreed that the vision is there, but claimed that there was a lack of focus\u2026that I could not \u201cbe all things to all men\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>The old generation of project manager are still in linear process and thinking hierarchically in too sharp a focus. Given your examples above concerning participation versus payed work I can see how the reallocation of resources in a distributed manner can fuel a distributed process whereby each of the participating entities can work together to achieve the best result. In the local setting you have to work with whats actually there. And so figuring that out is paramount (thats my answer to question 1 *ushaiddi/netention).</p>\n\n<p>Once we know whats there we need some kind of intermediary, like an Unmonastery who can go in and actually apply the medium for that primary issue and bring the people concerned to the same table with some notion of a potential reality, or a series of potential realities for them to work toward. It appears that the beuraucrats cannot think like this, they need to, at the very least, see its potential and deregulate and/or reregulate as necessary.</p>\n\n<p>When you ask how far along this is already I would say that it is very far along, and that through digital loops such as Edgeryders and the various thinker and tinkerer networks emerging online there will soon be an emergent software to cater to the needs of these communities to map assets and resources in ways that will far accelerate certain modes of production, namely socio-cultural production within circular economies where products become services and work becomes life (again)</p>\n\n<p>Given Alberto\u2019s concern I would like to offer that yes, there are two distinguishable interest groups emerging\u2026and yet it is in the interest of both to actually survive. Once thats assured, at least, there is still the concern of surviving without persisting in some crisis nightmare where even the highest amongst the \u2018have\u2019s\u2019 are worriedly watching. For the neccesary balance to occur the system has to be let find its own level, a level currently beyond the balancing power of the present socio-productive organization. Ideally, it can be recognized that different is not adverse, and that new is not to be feared, that just because its different doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t enjoy it or that you may not actually come to learn and grow of the experience. People forget the passion that got them to their \u2018comfort\u2019. We still need infrastructure, power, sustenance, education, culture, health services etc\u2026 Same-same\u2026 But different.</p>\n\n<p>You ask what are the dangers? I won\u2019t direct my attention there. Whats the use when there\u2019s so much potential to work with in the space of life between? People get aggressive over contradictive ideology, but when it comes to social situations and the proof of the collective pudding the lesson that history teaches us is that, so far at least, things have been getting steadily better for people. If we can move with the times and with the \u2018decisive technology\u2019, then we can shed our preoccupation with the abstract personal and with the symbolic and move into a deeperly lived, and more fully conscious, Life.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I believe that the route leads through culture and is a move, with the help of the head, to and through the heart and hands. I\u2019m working on a little something north of Berlin in May that will hopefully help me understand (and show a whole bunch of others at the same time) how different cultural groups can come together in a mutually supportive space to exchange values, and value, and crosspolinate to create a new space that is equally educational, packed with arts and culture, and productive of socially changent ripples. More about that later\u2026I think its a very good example of what you ask for in your third question.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for this Dougald, its a fine contribution.

He was saying that even if \u201ceconomic growth\u201d returns to Spain, it will only work for those people who were encouraged during the boom to climb as far as they can on the higher education ladder to get \u201cgraduate jobs\u201d. In fact, those who could afford to do so have kept climbing during the crisis \u2013 using Master/Phds as \u201cwaiting rooms\u201d while they were unemployed, and using their parent\u2019s homes &amp; support as \u201cwaiting rooms\u201d to avoid paying a premium on the crisis (i.e. high interest loans, flat evictions, etc). They\u2019ve accumulated social &amp; financial capital that provides a cushion. Those, however who were encouraged to leave school and go straight into the boom industries like construction, now have no industry or education to fall back onto and for the most part, given their parents were also employed in boom industries, they have no financial / support cushion either.</p>\n\n<p>What struck both of us was the irony of the situation, that people talk about the need to re-focus on the real economy (\u201cmaking stuff\u201d) to avoid a future boom &amp; bust. Yet those with the skills to \u201cmake &amp; build stuff\u201d are not only at a disadvantage because their industries have crashed, but because they haven\u2019t accumulated enough educational capital to compete even for jobs that haven\u2019t required this (most barman in Barcelona are graduates).</p>\n\n<p>The Center for New Work, West Norwood Feast &amp; Access Space are all examples of mobilising skills which involve \u201cmaking stuff\u201d so perhaps for this to coalesce into something serious is to create these spaces in communities which have been dependent on manual industries which have since died and find a way of supporting not just young people to develop &amp; resource these spaces, but their families too? (Some areas like in ex-mining villages have kept a community self-resourcing approach as a result of young people &amp; families working together, but many areas don\u2019t have this)</p>', u'post_id': 493, u'date': u'2013-02-06 10:12:00'}, {u'user_id': 13, u'title': u'Undisclosed content ', u'comment_id': 27006, u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 493, u'date': u'2013-02-06 19:14:00'}, {u'user_id': 1487, u'title': u'Undisclosed content ', u'comment_id': 27912, u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 493, u'date': u'2014-01-24 12:02:37'}, {u'user_id': 2201, u'title': u'Love it!', u'comment_id': 14141, u'content': u'<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/13/grin-and-share-it-midlife-housemates-flatsharing" rel="nofollow noopener">Some case studies</a> showcasing the benefits of shared living.</p>', u'post_id': 648, u'date': u'2016-04-07 05:50:02'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Not in this case', u'comment_id': 10701, u'content': u'<p>Direct income support is not part of the package in our group \u2013 at least not at this stage.

The other part is a willingness to cut each other slack; this all started with us accepting to sub-rent to recent migrants, who did not have jobs yet. We trusted them to make it happen, and they did.

Started in 'appear.in' but it was really laggy so we moved to Google hangouts.</p>\n\n<p>My feeling was that I'd be more likely to put effort into the open care thing if I believed it would come up with concrete results (e.g. helping people / reducing suffering) , if it was just making a big document that got read and largely ignored, I'd feel it was a waste of time, and I think everyone will share this feeling.</p>\n\n<p>I think Nadia agreed, and said that we could/should try to get some concrete change from this project (as well as fulfilling the minimum requirements of providing the research / ideas / documentation.)</p>\n\n<p>For the research part, I thought the only way to actually know what is going on would be to go to places where health care is needed, and talk to people first hand. Get a feel for their situation. (Rather that trusting info sources from others). So I think we could get people to visit anywhere that seems like it might lack good health care and talk to people in need, and the people giving the care. e.g. Refugee camps, impoverished inner city areas where there are too many people and not enough doctors / hospitals. Rural areas where it's hard for people to get health care. Go to places, talk to people get first hand accounts, do surveys and get numbers.</p>\n\n<p>For stats / raw data , I'd want to know:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>How many doctors/clinics/hospitals there are in the area.</p></li>\n<li><p>How the health care is funded: (is it governments paying with taxes? Charities? The communities themselves dealing with the problems, without outside help?)</p></li>\n<li><p>How do people get to the health care when they need it? distance? cost?</p></li>\n<li><p>How long do they have to wait? satisfaction with the care they receive?</p></li>\n<li><p>How many people need care and are not getting it?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>etc.</p>\n\n<p>Someone (forgot name) asked an important question: Does our client (client?) care about the situation in America, or because it's EU money do they not care about far away places, with maybe completely different situations / cultures?</p>\n\n<p>For the UK, an important question i would like answered is: 'how good is the NHS?' Are they doing the right thing, and only limited by lack of money, Or could their methods / efficiency be improved? If so, how? How could they improve? Better software / organisation? a change in culture?</p>\n\n<p>(I know they wasted a ton of money on software, cos they gave money to some lame suit and tie company instead of getting real hackers that smoke weed. But I guess that's really a separate issue.)</p>\n\n<p>To me, the most exciting idea would be to get hackers involved in health care. Healing people is (often / can be) easy when you apply creativity and radical tech and hacker problem solving mentality.</p>\n\n<p>I think an important question raised was 'is the legal side preventing this from happening more? Or will it get in our way?'</p>\n\n<p>Maybe hackers are put off operating on people cos they might get sued if it goes wrong? Or 'pretending' to be a dentist is illegal and only people with official training should be allowed to mess with teeth?</p>\n\n<p>(Issues with stuff like law getting in the way of common sense hacking with pacemakers cos of stupid patent laws / lack of open software ?)</p>\n\n<p>Nadia said we can find people with expert legal knowledge, and see what the situation is.</p>\n\n<p>(Common wisdom is that dentistry is very difficult and takes 7 years training, or whatever. I can see why this makes sense. It <em>is</em> very difficult and can get very bad results if it goes wrong, so obviously 'amateurs' should not hack teeth.</p>\n\n<p>However, I actually think this is not as obvious as some may think. When talking about starting a radical hacker community on an island, one of the points that came up, is can we really mange without any outside help? What if someone has tooth problems, should we consider this when deciding on location? I said 'we can't do dentistry, it's too hard' but some in our crew actually thought it was not beyond the realms of possibility. He would have to spend a few hours reading, and time making specialised equipment (drills, maybe X-ray machine, etc) and make our own morphine (actually that's the easy bit, but general anaesthetic can be tricky/dangerous). So anyway, I'm not suggesting it will be common place in the near future for people to get their teeth fixed at hackerspaces. Just wanted to point our that genius hackers can do amazing / crazy high tech things if they have the time. Nothing is beyond us. So I imagine it could be very feasible for hackers to help with more simple aspects of health care, and there is no reason that they should not be allowed to do so. )</p>\n\n<p>Also mentioned: hackers making rucksacks for refugees.</p>\n\n<p>What about shelters for homeless? I've always been keen on squatting, using tech knowhow to get abandoned buildings into liveable states.</p>\n\n<p>This is not directly health care, but you can argue prevention is better than needing to cure. E.g. if people are living on the streets or extreme poverty where they can't keep warm and dry, and wash, of course they are more like to get sick and have many health problems.</p>\n\n<p>So the thing that excites me the most is getting hackers involved in radical change like this.</p>\n\n<p>Nadia said that actually getting positive change was something we could and should be doing (even though technically we don't have to DO anything, just provide research / ideas).</p>\n\n<p>So she suggested that I could help organise an event in London, where we get hackers together, and see what we can do.</p>\n\n<p>So I think a big event with lots of hackers would be good.</p>\n\n<p>Nadia mentioned planing to do something in London, and in June. Not sure why London (just cos I was keen to help, and i know London?) or were you thinking of doing something in London anyway? and why June? dunno. but anyway, that seems feasible.</p>\n\n<p>The minimum i would expect from this, is just lots of brainstorming / ideas by smart hackers that we can document and add to the report.</p>\n\n<p>The best case, would be if something more long term came out of it, and they ended up improving health care in London.</p>\n\n<p>London hackspace would be the logical place to host it (and I know the members and trustees very well).</p>\n\n<p>So if you guys think that sounds like it's worth doing, I will contact them and see what they feel and if there is any support / excitement about the idea. They would probably allow the space to be used for free, but if we wanted a lot of people and for more than one day, it could be a nice gesture to offer to donate some money from the grant for use of the space. (it's entirely non-profit and run by members) (they did look into charity status, but decided against it)</p>\n\n<p>Normally it's members only, but they will make exceptions for special events (and a lot of the people interested would be members anyway).</p>\n\n<p>I know one or two members that are involved in edgeryders, so I would also contact them.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think?</p>", u'post_id': 5463, u'date': u'2016-03-15 23:45:00'}, {u'user_id': 2915, u'title': u'That works', u'comment_id': 20087, u'content': u'<p>thanks!</p>', u'post_id': 5491, u'date': u'2016-03-25 02:43:51'}, {u'user_id': 1442, u'title': u'Try this', u'comment_id': 14604, u'content': u'<aside class="onebox whitelistedgeneric">\n  <header class="source">\n    <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2016/11/News%20Articles/2137964?ln=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cds.cern.ch</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class="onebox-body">\n    <img src="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2137964/files/Twin%20solenoid%20&amp;amp_image.%20dipoles%20detector%20magnet%20system.jpg?subformat=icon" width="" height="" class="thumbnail">\n\n<h3><a href="http://cds.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2016/11/News%20Articles/2137964?ln=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">GOSH!

Why change a running system. Just some comments &amp; questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Sounds good, will you post every single link to the wiki then in advance, too (or is it one link for all sessions, referring to #3?)? Will there be a little time in the very beginning of the event when everyone is gathered so that you could walk people through a short introduction into Hackpad? I expect lots of people to join the documentation team kinda spontaneously on the spot, so they might appreciate a short "how to", if they never heard of Hackpad (the name alone can be a bit intimidating, as it <em>slightly</em> implies you gotta be techy). I\'m thinking of the pen and paper crowd here and of how to best invite people in case this is a new form of doing things for them.</p></li>\n<li><p>Good idea for people who like the communal documenting idea. I\'d like to add that people should still be encouraged to find a good balance between trying this if they like, but not feel pushed if they prefer to do it in another way. For me, it would be very distracting to listen to the session while co-documenting with others. I would easily get lost in trying to read other people\'s contributions - and have a lot of fun doing it - but get distracted. So yes, point to the Hackpad, and leave space for alternatives, so that people can do it the way they do it best.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Who would do this "pointing out", then? Can the speakers be asked to refer to the Hackpad link / Documentation thread in the beginning? No one of us will be around at every session, so how can this work best for all?</p>\n\n<p>Would it help to have a "how to document / Hackpad" poster in the room as a backup plan, so people can look up the basics there? Like this, for example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Like co-documenting with others? Go to: <a href="https://lote5.hackpad.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://lote5.hackpad.com/</a> and find the session. Group Hackpad on!</p></li>\n<li><p>Like to document individually? Enjoy. After you\'re done, please upload this here: "link in forum to be defined where the postings about sessions will be set up" and find the session you\'d like to contribute your documentation to.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or so ...? Don\'t know. How did you do it in the past so that it was clear where the documentation goes to? Before every session? Once at the very beginning of the event?</p>\n\n<ol><li>Would that mean that it\'s one large hackpack-document in the end? Would it then still be possible to link to individual parts of it, for example to add a link to the hackpad for session X to thread about session X?</li></ol>\n\n<p>More on general documentation/harvesting questions/coordination in next comment.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers</p>\n\n<p>Kaja</p>', u'post_id': 5255, u'date': u'2016-02-17 17:37:54'}, {u'user_id': 3, u'title': u'LOTE5 workspace on hackpad', u'comment_id': 10711, u'content': u'<p>The collection <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/alberto">@Alberto</a> mentions, I set it up:\xa0<a href="https://lote5.hackpad.com/">https://lote5.hackpad.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>It is public, but in order to edit it people need to log in.

I will definitely use it when I document \u2013 I guess I might start with John Coate\'s session. Let\'s see if you like it.\xa0</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Create a Hackpad with the same title as the session (<a href="https://hackpad.com/How-to-cope-with-meltdowns-in-communities-John-Coate-pT0JIs9tkWp">like this</a>). Do this well ahead of time. Hackpads are a mix betweeen a word processor and a wiki. You write into it as you would in a word processor; it has revision history and supports multiple authorship like wikis. The difference is that many people can edit it at the same time. There are many such tools: Google Docs, PiratePads, TitanPads etc. They are all OK, though ideally it\'s best to use just one for the whole conference. We used Hackpads at LOTE4 and it went quite well. If you want, I can elaborate on why I think it turned out to be an appropriate tool.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>When the session starts, point the documentation team people in the room to the Hackpad. If there is more than one person, we can take notes together on the same document. That\'s a lot of fun, because you see the notes grow before your eyes: people intuitively synchronize (if you are already writing something I leave it alone and add something else I had not had the time to note before, etc.)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Connect all Hackpads so that it is easier to navigate from one to the other, I need to look better into their data model: maybe this can be done by making a collection; or maybe, like at LOTE4, you can have a single Hackpad per conference day, with pre-made headers for each session.\xa0</li>\n\n</ol>', u'post_id': 5255, u'date': u'2016-02-09 05:43:35'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Documentation uploaded', u'comment_id': 32998, u'content': u'<p><a href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5-doc/documentation-collaborative-inclusion-how-migrants-residents" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5-doc/documentation-collaborative-inclusion-how-migrants-residents</a></p>', u'post_id': 5196, u'date': u'2016-03-03 18:11:40'}, {u'user_id': 8, u'title': u'Cool, joining us?', u'comment_id': 32979, u'content': u'<p>If so and you need a ticket...documentation tasks for a ticket :))\xa0<a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/documentation-harvesting-of-lote-what-why-how/5222"></a><a href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/documentation-harvesting-of-lote-what-why-how">https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/documentation-harvesting-of-lote-what-why-how</a></p>', u'post_id': 5196, u'date': u'2016-02-25 16:43:47'}, {u'user_id': 3188, u'title': u'Mapping initiative', u'comment_id': 32952, u'content': u'<p>Hi there,</p>\n\n<p>I thought I would share the "Jungle Maps" initiative in Calais/Dunkerke, which I find an interesting initiative to unfold realities behind migration :</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Jungle_Maps" rel="nofollow noopener"><span><a href="https://twitter.com/Jungle" rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/Jungle</a>Maps</span></a><span><span>\xa0</span></span><span>and</span><br></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/junglemapping" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/junglemapping" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/junglemapping</a></span></a><br></p>', u'post_id': 5196, u'date': u'2016-02-25 16:29:37'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'Just come', u'comment_id': 32945, u'content': u'<p>And talk to Noemi.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 5196, u'date': u'2016-02-25 23:01:57'}, {u'user_id': 3187, u'title': u'Undisclosed content ', u'comment_id': 32940, u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 5196, u'date': u'2016-02-25 17:36:17'}, {u'user_id': 8, u'title': u'Sign up for documentation duty and then show up :)', u'comment_id': 32931, u'content': u'<p>Instructions for documentatin and how to add yourself to the team here:\xa0<a href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/documentation-harvesting-of-lote-what-why-how">https://edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/documentation-harvesting-of-lote-what-why-how</a></p>\n\n<p>See you tomorrow <img src="https://edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 5196, u'date': u'2016-02-25 16:42:56'}, {u'user_id': 3187, u'title': u'Undisclosed content ', u'comment_id': 32899, u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 5196, u'date': u'2016-02-25 14:51:55'}, {u'user_id': 3143, u'title': u"I'd love to attend as well", u'comment_id': 32718, u'content': u"<p>Hello all,</p>\n\n<p>I'd love to join the workshop.</p>\n\n<p>In a way I have been a migrant for the past three years of my life.

First a bit about my professional life...\xa0I work in public health with migrant communities in Barcelona, Spain. My background is humanitarian worker in refugee camps and conflict affected areas (mainly in Africa)\xa0for various institutions. I have recently come back from Lesbos volunteering with the refugees with some friends with similar backgrounds. We were inspired by the work done by the volunteers taking on a huge share of the work of receiving the refugees alongside the usual suspects of the trade. We did feel that this amazing energy could\xa0be better harnessed to provide a follow up for people arriving so that they are not left stranded and without help once they leave Greece, or when they arrive at their destination. Taking stock of all the local groups and projects that are currently working to help refugees, we did wonder: What happens to people who do not speak any european languages or even arabic? What happens to the ones who do not read and write, or use internet? Is there a way to provide information on resources available along the way to refugees/migrants at their point of entry so that the ones who are less 'networked' are not stranded? We are thinking of these questions as we prepare to go back to\xa0the local volunteer groups we worked with in Greece. We have also started to linking families we have met in Greece with people willing to meet them\xa0at their point of destination.\xa0I don't know if these are themes of interest for this workshop, but in any case I am quite interested\xa0to hear from all of you if you think I could contribute on behalf of our little group.</p>\n\n<p>Best wishes!</p>", u'post_id': 5196, u'date': u'2016-02-19 14:06:20'}, {u'user_id': 3152, u'title': u'I would love to attend', u'comment_id': 31838, u'content': u'<p>Hi all, I am Nastasja, Polish-German from Berlin, living currently in Brussels.

Those substrates relate to one another through nodes on the right panel (catalysts). Catalysts are the "reasons" why substrates relate to one another. In the demo example, people get connected because they co-participate to political lodges (you may have recognized names from the so-called Paul Revere night ride from the American revolution). The quest is to try to figure out, for instance, who was in a position to reach all of those guys pretty quickly (in order to organize a mutiny before the British authority could counterfeit them).</p>\n\n<p>The x, y position of nodes is decided in the following way: nodes on the right panel are displayed using a force-directed layout (ask me if you have no idea what that is). There is no absolute meaning in the x or y value, nodes are just positioned so as to have a readable display.\xa0Nodes on the left panel are positionned according to how they relate to nodes in the right panel. The layout attemps at mimicking the layout on the left, substrates are positionned "around" the catalysts to which they correspond (although catalysts are not embedded in the panel. The reason is to make the selection more natural: when you select substrates\xa0at the top in the left panel, you may expect the corresponding catalysts to be located at the top in the right panel.</p>\n\n<p>The main feature is the easy selection of substrates or catalyst\xa0using the lasso.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ll be using Detangler with substrates=people and catalysts=topics, for instance.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy!</p>', u'post_id': 5260, u'date': u'2016-02-17 13:17:15'}, {u'user_id': 2945, u'title': u'thanks!

I\'m trying to re-organize the several proofs of concept which we put in place with <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/dora">@dora</a>, to have a unified simple tool that we might use to query wikipedia and store responses to a database, for later visualization.</p>\n\n<p>Based on what we managed to fetch via the API, here\'s what I was thinking:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>we have a list of the medicine pages</p></li>\n<li><p>for each page, we can query the pageviews, the links to other wikipedia pages and the translations into other languages</p></li>\n<li><p>for each link to other wikipedia pages, we can tell whether they\'re medicine pages or not; if they are, we can record they\'re semantically connected</p></li>\n<li><p>for each page translation we can repeat the above queries and store the relative data</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With the stored info we could try to analyze:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>which pages are connected, assuming their sub-network might represent a certain topic</p></li>\n<li><p>which pages (in absolute and relatively to a certain sub-network) have most views</p></li>\n<li><p>for each topic or sub-network, what is the weight of a specific language in the overall page count</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Things we might learn:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>higher page counts of certain topics might represent higher interest and/or practice of autodiagnosis for such topics (I\'m aware that what\'s actually relevant is how to tell between the two but we can investigate this further)</p></li>\n<li><p>existance of page translations in certain languages might imply a geographical and/or ethnographical relevance for certain areas and/or ethnies</p></li>\n<li><p>higher page counts for a certain topic, in a certain language, might be relevant too</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thinking of Edgesense and ways to use it (maybe) differently than what it was designed for, we might have nodes representing pages as "semantic knots" (more than "bits of conversation") and connections representing their semantic affinity. Edgesense could then be used to analyze whether the sub-regions it finds match the ones we found as wikipedia\'s internal links (mentioned above).</p>\n\n<p>We could also visualize page counts for each sub-region and each node, both as a global count (including all languages) ans as a "filtered" count, per ethnographic group.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if we imagine this visualized in three dimensions, we might have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>a planar XY mapping, with all the English medicine pages, where all connections are visualized and semantic sub-regions are highlighted (the distributions of nodes in 2D space wouldn\'t necessarily have a geographical meaning)</p></li>\n<li><p>a Z layering, where at each depth/height we have a "language plane" which shows which of the English pages are translated in a certain language</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Connections would exists across layers, giving a "volumetric" representation of medicine semantic networks.</p>\n\n<p>I guess this last bit might sound particularly abstract or confusing, until I manage to sketch a graphic prototype.

You want to do two things.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>A <em>multiplex\xa0</em>network of pages connected by links. The multiplex part takes advantage of wikidata: we know that "influenza" in English is the same thing as "grippe" in French through Wikidata. So, we can follow\xa0all the links from "influenza" and all the links from "grippe"; these will induce two networks, one English-speaking and the other one French-speaking". The networks might be different, and we can analyze that difference. In practice, you have a multiplex network in which each language is one layer of the multiplex.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>A page count exercise. Page counts have a separate collection method, that we discussed and fiddled around back in 32C3.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>If both exercises are successful, you have a multiplex network of medical pages in Wikipedia, each of which is associated to a number in terms of page counts per unit of time.

Correlation betweeen two languages is high if the probability of being connected of two random\xa0pages in language A, conditional to those two pages being connected in language B, is close to 1.

If that proves to be worth it, I/we can invest some more time the day after, to extend the code and produce something more meaningful.</p>\n\n<p>On the other end, I was trying to produce as much code and db data as I can, to have a good base to start with (and to share with everybody else, obviously).</p>\n\n<p>So far I have most of the code in place to do the data mining. I had to go through a few iterations, as we have limited db storage (free account on mongolab) and I needed to find a way both to do quick grouped queries and to store the results efficiently enough. I think I\'m pretty close: I could store around 25K entries in around 6Mb (of 200Mb we are allowed) in a few hours. These entries count 4.5K English pages and all their available translations in any language. This means that within 24h we should be able to populate the db with all the pages, from scratch.</p>\n\n<p>This does not include the page counts, though, which require a separate query and I\'m still figuring out if there\'s a way to optimize those (ie. not sending a query per page).</p>\n\n<p>I\'ll test this later or tomorrow, but I\'m confident I can get decent results in reasonable time.</p>\n\n<p>This partially answers <a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/melancon">@melancon</a>\'s question about what I\'m storing. In terms of page counts, both because of time and storage restrictions, I was thinking to store sample counts for a given period (ie. 1 month of pagecounts, per day), instead of a tighter sampling.</p>\n\n<p>I thought that, for the sake of demonstration, any timeframe can be used to prove the concept, and we can assume that the real measures will then take place on more accurate/representative data.</p>\n\n<p>Do you think it is acceptable, as an assumption?</p>\n\n<p>Does it still sound too scary?

I find this a convenient concept, probably more buzzwordy than deep -- anything is multiplex if you think about it ... it depends on what you are ready to term a layer ... We\'ll have plenty of time to chew about this.</p>\n\n<p>You got things right. There are several ways to compute similarity between entities described by a "bag of words" (which you can actually see as embedded in a high-dimensional vector space ...). The better your index (words associated with entities), the better the similarity measures, from which you usually derive a topology by linking similar enough entities. As for the pagecount, I would expect larger time span to lead to\xa0somehow uniform pagecounts over all pages, while finer time spans may\xa0indicate when/if pages are simultaneously consulted.</p>\n\n<p>The link structure you consider, the similarity measure you computeIt all depends on what question/task you are supporting.</p>\n\n<p>As I see it, you have done quite a lot of work and will be bringing fantastic material to the workshop.

I imagine a sort of "landing strip": when someone makes it across the border, they are somehow channeled into taking a series of steps towards safety first, and integration later. These steps are not obvious. My analogy is what happens in Milan to Eritrean newcomers: an informal network of people (many of whom Eritrean-Italians) takes newcomers in charge as they take the first baby steps. They need to be picked up at the point of entry (railway or bus stations): telling them "take the Metro Line 2 and get off at Lambrate" is not going to work, even if you have a common language to communicate in, because they do not know how to use public transport. So, people call each other to go pick up complete strangers at 5.00 in the morning, ask friends for spare beds and couches as newcomers take aim for the next step, which in Italy is typically trying to get to Sweden/Germany/wherever.

A lot of us in OpenCare don\'t know each other\'s work except in "keywords", and the more we can learn the more useful for the different takes on care to make sense taken together, which is why we have a consortium in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>I\'d like to propose a small adjustment: it seems there\'s agreement for Day 1 to be meeting-style. Given that Day2, the 25th is the launch day for Living on the Edge conference, we have to consider a broader audience making contact for the first time. It would be great to use it as OpenCare context setting and public launch: an overview on care fails rather than data. I suggest planning Manzini\'s, Lucia\'s, Marko\'s and other talks+ maker workshops from the team here, and leave MoN for 26th, when it can run in parallel with other Lote sessions.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><a target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/markomanka"></a><a class="mention" target="_blank" href="https://edgeryders.eu/u/markomanka">@markomanka</a>\xa0the easiest to manage is if you let us know how much time you would need at a minimum, rather than the other way around.

This is actually my preferred outcome provided that MoN can be pre-produced\xa0<em>a lot.</em>\xa0For example, this was made in one-day hackathon, but the main graph had been pro-produced; and that meant finding the data, downloading them, cleaning them, and writing the Python script that put it in network form.

So, I would suggest trimming it to 10:00-18:00 (hey, it\'s Sunday!). Secondly, we probably need to add lunch. Is there a plan for that already? Thirdly, I would suggest adding in a walk during the day. There is a way to actually continue the workshop <em>while</em> walking, which is both healthy and fun. Is there a nice itinerary we could think of? (Max 1 hour, so about 3-4km.)</p>\n\n<p>While 30-45 minutes is probably good for tackling a project, it can get a bit unpredictable (in both directions: not having enough time to finish or finishing early). Personally, I strongly prefer a "natural flow", where we move things forward as fast as comfortable, but without artificial cut-off points. The only way to do this is to have participants agree that their project might not end up getting discussed and do a little exercise early on to determine in what sequence we will tackle the stories/projects. I think if this is communicated early on, it won\'t be a problem. Also keep in mind that everyone is pretty busy all the time, so it\'s not like you have to wait for your turn. What do you think?</p>\n\n<p>The last issue has to do with number of participants. Again, I prefer a naturalistic approach: whoever comes is the right people. I can do the intro/explanation for a fairly large group if necessary and I\'m suspecting Edgeryders attracts a <em>lot</em> of people with experience in similar techniques that will easily pick up on my cues. The one thing that complicates things is AV equipment: we do need more DSLR- and videocameras if more people come.

Apparently, her administration thought\xa0 that a society of home owners would be more invested (literally) in the status quo. They turned out to be mostly right.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, my point is that before that time people did have families, and they did not feel particularly flaky, quite the contrary. So I would submit that the perceived stability of a familial arrangement has little to do with home ownership. Maybe an important factor is, rather, the rigidity of the agreement that binds it members together: practically indestructible in the case of parent-to-offspring, solid but less committal in\xa0 that of sibling-to-sibling, more instable in that of life partner-to-life partner, and even more in that of the housemate-to-housemate.</p>", u'post_id': 1438, u'date': u'2012-04-13 11:52:09'}, {u'user_id': 102, u'title': u'Undisclosed content ', u'comment_id': 17309, u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 1438, u'date': u'2012-04-12 19:21:53'}, {u'user_id': 27, u'title': u'Undisclosed content ', u'comment_id': 14850, u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 1438, u'date': u'2012-04-12 16:09:15'}, {u'user_id': 4, u'title': u'The co-housing expert', u'comment_id': 13216, u'content': u'<p>Simone, here on Edgeryders, is the chairperson of the first really successful co-housing scheme in Italy.

But how many friends are too many friends? one asks although of course there\'s no right answer. My capability is really reduced to maintaining lively, yet sporadic relationships with only a few, but probably there comes a time when your work or interests, like yours for politics and music, really drive more activity and it becomes natural or indispensable to cultivate those interests by sharing interesting stuff with the people around, with as many people around.</p>\n\n<p><em>Whilst Facebook/Social Media in general is a very good thing, people have forgotten about the pleasure there is in being in someone\'s physical company, or hearing their voice, and I am trying to spend less time and less energy with my online world, so that my outside world can be full of experience.</em></p>\n\n<p>About the above, do you think there can be <strong>an effect</strong> of spending a lot of time online and fogetting or losing ability to connect offline as well? Not as a rule of course, but can that happen? Or that the more confident you get online, the more inhibited you can become when you\'re out of that comfort zone and out with strangers? I\'d be really curious to read some studies on that.. <a href="http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/users/lyne-robichaud">Lyne</a> here, who\'s really active online, she says (can\'t find the reference) she can spend days without even talking to someone, and that she even feels good about this. Of course I\'d have to ask her if she was as quiet before starting to be online most of the time. I\'d doubt after a certain age, and being socialized mostly offline, as some of us were before fb and twitter, you would no longer feel comfortable interacting outside the online sphere.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of Strasbourg, we\'re looking forward to a confirmation on your part, you should\'ve already got an invitation to the June conference via email.

I am impressed. It\'s all wise, with the wisdom that comes, well, from experience: from having put in the famous 10,000 hours that, allegedly, make us into masters of anything (yes, you have probably spent thousand of hours online). It\'s all there: the enjoyment and the exhaustion, the new exhalting friendships and the wariness, the interesting, up-to-date information and the longing for physical interaction.</p>\n\n<p>A friend of mine like to say that he does not engage anymore in any debate between techno-enthusiasts ("we will all upload ourselves into a Global Awareness and evolve into pure energy") and techno-sceptics ("all of this information, so little knowledge! People are becoming more and more stupid!"). He thinks that these two positions are really flip sides of the same techno-deterministic coin. By contrast, he does not believe we are our technology. He likes to quote Kranzstein\'s Third Law instead: technology is neither good nor bad, <em>nor is it neutral</em>. And this means doing what you do: dipping a foot in the water while balancing on the other one; making careful decisions whether to engage, how much, who with. Looking at the back end of things, where technological effects (the costless, infinite replicability of digital information) and economic ones (like Facebook encouraging you to share more than it\'s good for you, because they sell targeted advertising, and the more you share the more precise their targeting gets) gently nudge your personal life. It might look as hypocrisy, but the Victorians considered a little hypocrisy a virtue, and it might be they had a point.</p>\n\n<p>None of this was introduced in the digital age. Technological constraints have always been there: chances are, 200 years ago you\'d end up marrying someone from your village - the high costs of travelling (i.e. the inefficiency of travelling technology)\xa0 made it impractical to court anyone else. And don\'t even get me started on the social implications of economic relationships: Karl Marx even called his underclass "proletarians", childrenbringers. If you had no assets, a sound survival strategy was to have many children that could be put to work. But this is our age, these are our challenges, and we need to meet them. As far as I can see, no one has found a better way than your trial-and-error, trying to seize the opportunities of richer human relationships\xa0 while staying safe from the risks. And yes, it might be a good idea to give Diaspora a go.</p>\n\n<p>OT: you were <em>in Strasbourg?</em> This is where we are!
