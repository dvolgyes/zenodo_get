[{u'content': u'<p>The mighty <a class="mention" href="/u/markomanka">@markomanka</a>, after some lengthy discussions with others (including myself), has produced a very interesting document. It is an explicit social contract, of the sort we imagine is hovering over the best community-care initiatives we have seen in the two years of opencare.  I find it very, very thought provoking; it seeks a way that we can promise to do our best, which is all that communities can do, while still taking responsibility.

Ready-to-go, affordable health and social care was \u2013 and still is \u2013 unavailable. Not for some unknown person in some distant land, either. For friends and family members, people in our communities, right here. Something had to be done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We see people coming together, stepping into the breach</strong>. Communities are taking up the role of care providers, making it work where neither the state nor private business could. They are doing amazing things. Hackers make <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citizen-hackers-concoct-upgrades-for-medical-devices-1411762843">open sourced, internet-enabled glucose monitors</a> for children with diabetes. Belgian trauma therapists <a href="/t/trauma-tour/707">set up mobile studios</a> and drive them to refugee camps in Greece, to help bereaved refugees. Bipolar 1 patients find and help each other <a href="/t/losing-hope-gaining-hope/529">fight back suicidal tendencies</a>. Biologists and biohackers are trying to invent <a href="/t/how-open-insulin-works-to-open-source-science-and-medicine/519">a cheap, open source process to make insulin</a>. Activists in America encourage each other to eat healthy food and exercise <a href="/t/woodbine-health-autonomy-center/488">by doing it together</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We started a research projects to take a good look inside these and many other stories. We wanted to learn what these initiatives have in common, and how we could make more. That project is called <a href="http://opencare.cc">OpenCare</a>; it is now in its second year. Results are still coming through, but one thing is already clear:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>It\'s all about humans.</em></strong></p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Community provision of care services needs humans:  more, better prepared, volunteers. People prepared to teach each other skills.  Therapists to help volunteers in need of trauma support. So, the highest-impact technologies are those that help bring people together. Share knowledge. Distribute human resources across different care contexts. These technologies are connectors: they help string together and coordinate human efforts.</p>\n\n<p>This intuition is fundamental. It goes even beyond care. And it makes sense: we are, after all, the 99%. We have little money and power. We have no large companies, fancy foundations, prestigious universities. But we do have each other. <strong>We will thrive, if we can collaborate</strong>. Collaboration is expensive, and hard to monetise. Any technology that makes it more efficient is going to make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>At Edgeryders, we have resolved to put this lesson into practice. <strong>We are doing it by hacking the most fundamental connecting technology of all: the home.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We dream of a new kind of space</strong>, that can be the hearth for our families but still be open to the broader world. Where the door is not a gate to keep the wolves out, but a bridge to a global network. Where we can live, and work, and sometimes work with the people we live with, and live with our co-workers. Where people are welcome to stay for one day, or a lifetime. Where spending even just an hour in good heart ensures you will never be a stranger again. Where we can develop our talent, learn new skills, get better at what we do. Where we can create for each other a healthy, friendly, cosmopolitan environment and, yes, take care of each other.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We have dreamt this dream before</strong>. In its previous iteration, we called it the <a href="/t/unmonastery/315">unMonastery</a>. We prototyped it in 2014, in the Italian city of Matera. That experience taught us much. The most important lesson was this: a life/work space can not be too close to the needs of a single client. Neither can it be dependent on the grant cycle. It needs to be financially self-sustaining, and benefit several projects and lines of business. We also learnt how important it is to be diverse, open and outward-looking for fresh air and fresh ideas to circulate at all times.</p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8f4b0a42f2afab8649f53b79cb0eb632bb59cf31.jpg" width="667" height="375"></p>\n\n<p><em>2014: Lunch in the sun at the unMonastery Matera</em></p>\n\n<p>But the unMonastery also got many things right. <strong>The one I am proudest of is this: we went ahead and tried it</strong>. Planning and due diligence are necessary, but trying things out makes for richer learning.</p>\n\n<p>So, we are not going to keep dreaming about a new space. We are trying a second iteration. Right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We are calling it The Reef</strong>. Coral reefs are structures built by tiny animals, corals. They serve as the home, anchoring point, hiding place, hunting ground to thousands of species. Algae, seaweeds, fish, molluscs all cooperate with, compete with, eat, feed each other. As they do so, they benefit the corals, who gain access to nutrients (reefs exist in nutrient-poor tropical waters).</p>\n\n<p>Like coral reefs, <strong>our new space will draw strength in diversity and symbiosis</strong>. Different people will bring in different skills, access to different networks, different personalities. And Edgeryders (a social enterprise, so a creature of a different species) will live in symbiosis with the space and the individuals that live in it. It will pay rent, subsidising those who live there; in return, it will be able to use the space for its own purposes: office, coworking space, venue for small events.</p>\n\n<p>And like coral reefs, <strong>our new space is going to be an ecology \u2013 a network</strong>. There are many ways to take part in it. Some people will want to live there full time, others will show up once or twice a month, or a year. Some will use it on building projects with us, and with each other. Others will work on shared learning and professional development. Of course, we already have a network: the Edgeryders online community itself. This will not go away, in fact it will become ever more important. But now The Reef will give it a permanent offline presence. Reef members will be the kernel of the Edgeryders community. Everyone is free to join the kernel or not; everyone is free to play the role she feels most at home with.</p>\n\n<p>We ran the numbers and we are sure we can make it work. We are going to start with a small-scale prototype: a Brussels loft, with four bedrooms, common living area, office, courtyard. <a class="mention" href="/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> , <a class="mention" href="/u/nadia">@Nadia</a> and I are going to be full-time residents; one more room will host temporary residents. We are going live on May 1st 2017, and try it out for one year. We are already looking for a (much) larger space to move into in spring 2018 if the experiment goes well.</p>\n\n<p>Are you considering being part of the experiment, or just curious about it? There are three things you can do.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tWe are planning a side event to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1565289333786291/">OpenVillage Festival</a> dedicated to The Reef. There, we will design the physical space, its financing model, and the activites therein \u2013 from business to physical fitness and personal development. It is restricted to members, because this is our future home we are talking about. It\'s up to people with skin in the game to make decisions about it. <a href="/t/building-the-reef/6205">Info here</a>.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tWe are running our first personal development event in The Reef itself on 26-27 May. We will learn to be better public speakers in the Power Pitch weekend. <a href="/t/powerpitch-a-2-day-masterclass-on-storytelling-for-conversion-may-26-27-at-the-reef-brussels/6204">Info here</a>.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tGet in touch! Write, or join our community calls, or come over for coffee.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>So: a place-based symbiosis of some inhabitants of the edge, a mutant company, and no book to do it by.</strong> It\'s not going to be easy. But it has the vibe I was looking for: the excitement of building, and the pleasure of doing it with good, solid people. It is in the sweet spot between ambition and achievability.

It is very hard to find a balance when we want them to become self-sustainable in the long run. How long shall we provide the housing subsidies? How to help the refugees to become self-sustainable in the long run? What criteria should be used to qualify the family? How can social workers stay objective in evaluating each case? What if after 3-6 months of support none of the family members are able to find a job? What if the available jobs are hardly enough to pay the rent? </span></p>\n\n<p><span>E.g. A single father with 4 kids(one of them is mentally disabled) and he just has no way to work even though his disabled son started attending an art therapy workshop(from 10AM to 2PM) he still needs to cook, clean and do house chores during that time. There is no part time job available for him and he is not motivated to look for one neither; he needs psychological help but he refuses it. The government can not offer him a stipend(40 Euros per child/month) since he is not yet a citizen of Armenia and even if he receives the stipend it will not be enough to sustain his family.</span></p>\n\n<p>Another problem we are facing in Armenia is the facilitation of information communication for the refugees: we got many organisations that offer different kind of assistance but it seems like refugees do not have access to the information and feel lost when they need help(healthcare, housing, employment, food/clothing, etc).\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I am currently doing a desk research about how to improve the social services for the refugees here in Armenia. The aim is to mobilize all the organisations working with refugees to create an independent unit of trained social workers(including many Syrian-Armenians as it would provide them with a job and they are naturally motivated to help other refugees) and create an effective system to deal with the issues of Syrian refugees in Armenia.</p>\n\n<p>Here\'s<a href="http://www.eurasianet.org/node/68332" rel="nofollow noopener"> a recent article</a> about the hardships many refugees face in Armenia and<a href="http://www.armenianredwoodproject.org/new-blog/2015/12/11-why-should-armenian-organizations-work-together-to-ensure-resiliancy-in-the-face-of-the-syrian-migrant-crisis" rel="nofollow noopener"> another one</a> about why Armenian organisations should work together to ensure resiliency in the face of the Syrian migrant crisis.</p>\n\n<h3>Tentative agenda</h3>\n\n<p><span>Coming soon.\xa0</span></p>\n\n<h3>\n\n</h3><p><a name="PreWorkshop"></a>Before the workshop</p>\n\n<p>Coming soon.</p>\n\n<h3>\n\n</h3><p><a name="References"></a>Possible references:</p>\n\n<p>Reading the references is not obligatory at all!

My background is in biochemistry and used to be a biology teacher for secondary school. Currently I am a researcher in the field of Open science with a focus on the maker movement and biohacking in the African context. I am also the President of the Association for the Promotion of Open Science in Haiti and Africa (APSOHA). <br>The maker movement and biohacking interest me deeply, due to their potential to overcome most of challenges the African Health system faces (e.g. many hospitals lack the basic materials, like microscopes). The possibility to modify hardware (e.g. connect a solar panel to a PCR machine and so on) is an advantage.<br>In order to promote this potential, I have organised this conference : \u201cBiohacking in the medical field: perspectives for developing countries\u201d, Yaound\xe9, Cameroon, Mai 2017<br>Even if the potential benefits are high, the maker movement and biohacking are subjects of critics, since : practices are very Western oriented, local knowledge is not acknowledged (it\u2019s classified as superstition or culture) and values are often not put into practice as they should. My paper entitled \u201cBenefit and the hidden face of the maker movement: Thoughts on its appropriation in African context\u201d  was written from the critic perspective.  </p>\n\n<p>In Africa, the maker movement and biohacking is facing many difficulties: 1) the vision differs fundamentally from the usual makers/biohackers. When I ask Western biohackers \u201cwhy do you make this?\u201d, it\u2019s usually just for fun, like a hobby. In Africa, it is not the same, geeks are hacking to solve a problem, and to help people. 2) the machines that are usually made, are not prototyped in an African context. Although there are exceptions, often they are not useable. Therefore I promote biohacking in Africa in collaboration with electrotechnicians etc., so things can be tested and used. 3) The basic electronic components which are not easily affordable and available in Africa. Even the raspberry pi and Arduino are not easy to get; you have to order it from China.  4) The capitalistic system is another hurdle, because even if the prototype is good, there is standards defined by the WHO so that prototypes or materials to be used in hospitals, should fit with a standard. These standards are defined by the big companies. You cannot, as a biohacker, fight the establishment. They define the standard. This critique is addressed to the system managing health: it does not let people do it themselves. 5) Biohacking is not completely new to Africa, but it remains not supported by African Governments. People behind the project suffered a lot eg. The geek who made a cardiopad, was supported only when the state saw that media everywhere in the world, talk about this cardiopad invention (CNN, BBC, ...). </p>\n\n<p>However, some strategies and support can help to overcome these difficulties: 1) Government support, by the implementation of national policies on Open science. This is our biggest obstacle, not money or other things. 2) International organisations can be used as a vehicle of Open science. Because there is a kind of epistemic and colonial alienation which makes that our leaders trust in International Organization (because of money) and they are very open to discuss with white people. The reality is all things coming from the white people, West and NGO\u2019s are \u2018good\u2019, while they don\u2019t listen to their own people. 3) Due to these realities, most of the geeks engaged in biohacking are successful because they are connected with Western geeks and lab. <br>There are not many fablabs, makerspaces or \u2018protofablabs\u2019 in Africa. Some of them are promoted by personal efforts, association or companies. The Woelab in Togo is well known and has success. In Cameroon there is the fablab Ongola Lab, supported by Orange and Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie. But communities seem not deeply involved due to their perception of these spaces. That is why the science shop model has a lot of potential to change the African conception of fablab, rather than replicate the western model. </p>\n\n<p>In my community, I conducted some project to give better life to people by hearing their needs and build solutions together. Like safe water to drink as I did in my village several years ago. I am not supported even by the state or by the rural council. If the pump is broken or whatever, I pay money to keep it going. I cannot ask villagers for money because they don\u2019t have it. <br>I did other projects as well. Together with my wife, a teacher in nutrition, we did some research to reduce children malnutrition in rural zone; since many mothers cannot afford the right meals. We have created a formula using local ingredients, to help them give a balanced diet to their baby. All the work is freely accessible here (<a href="https://www.zenodo.org/record/57037/export/xm#.WcauGoxSxPY" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.zenodo.org/record/57037/export/xm#.WcauGoxSxPY</a>) and it\u2019s being used in our direct environment. We can help for a local problem, for 10 or 20 children, but cannot do it for the whole village. For a larger impact, it needs to be spread. We don\u2019t get the support we need to do this.</p>\n\n<p>A powerful weapon is education. Imagine: introduce biohacking in the curriculum. What would happen after 10 years, 20 years? How could we do this, since our governments seems inactive? For me the first thing is to hack textbooks by writing ourselves. I did it through this platform : <a href="http://www.fabrel.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fabrel.org/</a>. <br>Without national and/or international support, I feel tired and not sure that I will continue. <br>I\u2019d love to come to the OpenVillage Festival in October because I want to share my experience with others, continue to build a strong African community of biohacking, shape strategies for the use of Open science in healthcare and mostly, learn from others\u2026</p>', u'post_id': 37182, u'user_id': 4063, u'timestamp': u'2017-09-29 10:46:26', u'title': u'Thomas Mboa (Who am I?)'}, {u'content': u'<p><strong>What follows is a long story documenting some of\xa0my experiences working as a caregiver on the Calais camp during March - May 2016.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first thing that strikes you about the Calais camp is the smell. In the beginning you assume it comes from the camp itself. After prolonged exposure to it you realise it comes from the chemical plant next door. It pours a strange chemical tang over the surrounding area. I will never forget that smell. It masks the true nature of the camp.</p>\n\n<p>I use this image to emphasise the unsanitary conditions of the site, and how you become desensitised to them.</p>\n\n<p>Each morning at the l\u2019Auberge des Migrants Warehouse between 40-200 volunteers arrive to help with the day\u2019s tasks. It is one of 2 or 3 three aid organisations in the area serving the needs of the camp.</p>\n\n<p>The number varies depending on the day of the week or the time of year. The tasks at the warehouse vary in difficulty and duration. Some people may find themselves chopping firewood for a day, or sorting through clothing donations. Those that can only volunteer for a day or two will do these jobs that base them at the warehouse. Volunteers that are available for a week or more will join the clothing or food distribution team. This involves spending a lot of time on the camp working face-to-face with refugees.</p>\n\n<p>Volunteers available for a month or more find themselves joining the \'Aid Distribution\' or \'Vulnerabilities\' team.</p>\n\n<p>These teams work on the camp every day. Travelling from shelter to shelter to assess aid requirements and taking clothes and food to vulnerable people (children, elderly, injured). When i started at the Calais camp these teams didn\u2019t exist. I helped to set up, test and structure the team program. Now, 5 months later the teams are indistinguishable from the basic structures that i helped to set up.</p>\n\n<p>Working days are long and filled with waiting. Long-term volunteers have to balance time considerations to get the most work done. Volunteers arrive early. UK volunteers have early Channel ferries to pack a full day in. Or the locals from Belgium and France are more balanced towards early starts. As a result the warehouse opens early with many arriving around 8am to start working.</p>\n\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum the refugees on the camp rarely rise before 11am. Many have been up for most of the night; making attempts to get into the port area, travelling to lorry parks nearby; etc. The camp itself comes to life at about 4pm with the most people around between 4pm and 10pm.</p>\n\n<p>This means days often start with a lot of waiting. They often extend further into the evenings for the long-term volunteers. 12hr+ days without proper breaks are par for the course, particularly for the volunteers working on the camp with the refugees.</p>\n\n<p>Those working in the Aid Distribution team have to work in intimate personal spaces. The role requires you to enter into the shelters and tents of refugees to communicate with them. Preferably, this requires a translator, but most communication is through non-verbal, gesture and eye-contact. Even with a total language barrier, the way the refugees welcome you into their personal space is heart warming. The experience is unlike anything I have experienced elsewhere. For many British volunteers this immediate intimacy from strangers can be strange and disorienting. It feels odd to accept food, drink and hospitality from people who have so little already. Yet, rejecting the offer also seems heartless. It is difficult to balance these conflicting emotions. I often struggle to balance my desire to be \u2018efficient\u2019 at the task, with being \u2018friendly\u2019 to the people I\u2019m helping. I could spend a whole day working with only 10-15 people: Eating food with them; making notes about vulnerabilities; listening to the needs of their community and drinking sweet milk chai. Then I remember that there are thousands of people on the camp. If I spend the same amount of time with each group it would take years to finish the simple tasks.</p>\n\n<p>In these small, intimate moments people open up to you. Some share stories, opinions on the camp or photos from their phones. Some photos are of family and home. Some photos are graphic images of violence and bloodshed. You never know if these images are from their own experience, or if they are from external sources. Almost every refugee can connect to the internet and people share images amongst groups. You know it would be rude to ask for verification. You are frequently reminded not to push anyone to tell you about their life before, or their journey. You are not a therapist and reliving traumatic experiences can re-traumatise them.</p>\n\n<p>These moments also show you how angry people are. Refugees stop you in their shelters, or on the paths around the camp. Inter-community tensions seeps out through small cracks. The walls and fences of the Calais port don\u2019t discriminate between nations. So neither does the camp. Afghanis rub up against Iranians, Indians, Sudanese and Syrians. Some communities are better established on the camp. Some manage their resources and people better than others. Some communities have established \'leaders\' who act as a lynchpin for fellow countrymen. I met a young Indian refugee who was angry there was no Indian community leader. I explained to him he was the first refugee from India i had met on the camp. He was de facto the community leader for his nation.</p>\n\n<p>Race, religion and resource issues overlap in a fraught and challenging space. It is surprising that it doesn\'t descend into violence more often. The fact it doesn\'t is a testament to the work done by volunteers, and faith and community leaders on the camp.</p>\n\n<p>When it does break down like this it is scary and totally unexpected. You can never relax into to the role. Every day demands that you prepare to be surprised. You can be disarmed by a moment of pure joy and positivity from a happy young man. Around the next corner you could be challenged by an angry refugee, or a major medical injury.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes the pressure comes from the armed police that surround the camp. At every entrance a bus full of armed police waits. They stop all vehicles going on to the camp. Sometimes they\'re friendly, sometimes officious, always confrontational. When there are problems on the camp or the nearby Motorway they respond with CS gas canisters. They fire them at will over the whole camp. Dispersing refugees into shelters. The canisters overheat when they let the gas out, this causes fires in the camp. Often the police target refugee communal areas like restaurants and shops. They try to use the gas to burn them down. I will never forget walking through the camp, under a thick fog of CS gas, my throat raw, shielding my watering eyes from the gas with a scarf.</p>\n\n<p>In the end you start to live like the refugees on the camp: day-to-day, expecting the unexpected, desperate to get away to the \u2018real world\u2019 but somehow unable to move on.</p>\n\n<p>You find yourself under the same strain as the refugees. You get emotionally attached to their quest. You want them to succeed at making it across the Channel. But when they leave the camp to try you feel a gut-wrenching fear for them. You\u2019ve heard too many bad stories \u2013 about the armed police; about the fascist skinheads that patrol around the ferry ports; and refrigerated lorries. Whilst I was there I met two people I later found out fell under the wheels of a moving lorry, or became trapped in airless lorry containers; suffocating to death.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes you hear someone you work alongside for months has made it across to the UK. You feel overwhelmingly happy for them. Then you feel sad and angry that you don\u2019t get to see them anymore. Then you feel guilty for being selfish.</p>\n\n<p>In the end there is either hope, or hopelessness; Chance or no Chance. Both suffocate you and the refugees. It clouds all your conversations and interactions.</p>\n\n<p>Mentally, the camp comes back with you into the volunteer spaces. Most volunteers are young people between the ages of 18 and 25. They are mostly students and temporary/seasonal workers. A lot of long-term volunteers work in the UK music festival community.</p>\n\n<p>Mental health for the volunteers is a concern. Everyone lives on a knife-edge. Most volunteers self-finance their time working in Calais. They live frugally, stretching their money out. This means they end up living on top of each other. The warehouse team has a caravan park attached to the building. Volunteers with no money can stay there. Living up to 6 people in a caravan, with limited access to hot water and personal space. Volunteers who live in this enclave have a different experience to those who stay in private accommodation or hostels.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone experiences some form of trauma. Most experience exhaustion. Often trauma comes from being in scary situations that you aren\'t trained to deal with. Occasionally volunteer social workers, therapists and psychologists stop by the volunteer camps. They offer their services for free. As always, the people who need it the most are most likely to not take advantage of these services.</p>\n\n<p>I met a few long term volunteers who had become caregivers 24/7. They would work long hours on the camp or managing the warehouse. In the evening they would sit listening to the emotional and personal problems of volunteers. They might operate on only 5-6 hours sleep per night and then do another 18hr day of work. Every day. Every week.</p>\n\n<p>Days off from the work of the warehouse and camp are encouraged, and even scheduled. But they are ignored, rescheduled, or simply don\'t happen. People feel responsible for the people on the camp. They can\'t switch off.</p>\n\n<p>The management team at the warehouse made some great improvements even in the short time I was there. More training for long term volunteers on conflict resolution and dealing with difficult people. More training on how to self care and look after each other. The warehouse caravan park was designated an alcohol-free zone. Resident meeting were set back up. A weekly \'safe space\' for free and open personal discussion was created in the warehouse. Weekly film screenings were restarted.</p>\n\n<p>Over all this positive improvement still hangs the uncertainty of the future. Volunteer numbers have decreased. Aid donations have slowed. Some organisations struggle to fundraise the money needed to provide services on the camp - for the first time since last year refugees on the camp report hunger and malnutrition.</p>\n\n<p>In the face of this adversity volunteers get up every day and go onto the camp to help. They meet people new and old, hear new stories, discover new problems and show a friendly face to those in need. Not because it\'s their job, but because they feel a duty to help.</p>\n\n<p>A 16yr old Afghani boy i worked with every day for 2 weeks asked me a question one night: \u201cWhy is the world so faithless?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I didn\'t know how to respond at first. What did he mean? Was he asking about religion? I couldn\'t answer. So i thought for 10 minutes</p>\n\n<p>Finally, i responded:</p>\n\n<p>"I don\'t think it is. The world is full for people who are scared. This fear drives their actions. But there are always others who respond to fear with love. This love is faith." He gave me a look that said \'strange European man, you know nothing of the world!\'</p>\n\n<p>Yet i stand by my answer. Every day hundreds of volunteers from all over Europe travel onto the Calais camp to show this love. They come with gifts and open hearts. They leave exhausted, frustrated and heartbroken. And they come back the next day, and the next. That has to be something positive.</p>\n\n<p>Do you have similar experiences working with refugees in other parts of Europe?</p>\n\n<p>Do you have any useful experience that might help the volunteers at the camp?</p>\n\n<p>Do you have any ideas for how the Calais refugee situation could be re-structured after the evictions?</p>\n\n<p>Are there any other parts of my experience that you would like to learn more about?</p>\n\n<p>The production of this article was supported by <a href="/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296">Op3n Fellowships</a> - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016</p>', u'post_id': 536, u'user_id': 2569, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-16 14:35:13', u'title': u'Care on the camp - A Calais story'}, {u'content': u'<h1><strong>DIY WELFARE WHEN SYSTEMS FAIL</strong></h1><h2><strong>Meet people who are doing it.

It is frequently in our papers and on our televisions, yet beyond the UK and the direct environment of Calais the Calais camp has not received the kind of attention it deserves.</p>\n\n<p>\u2018The Jungle\u2019, as it has become known, is a large camp on the edge of the Calais port area. It sits on top of a series of sand dunes, small lakes and wastelands on the very edge of the French coastline, right by the lorry parking area at the port. Before it was settled it was an industrial dumping ground, and previous checks of the ground have found traces of heavy metallic elements like Cobalt, as well as large amounts of old asbestos panelling that had broken down.</p>\n\n<p>On top of all this sits a huge camp for migrants and displaced people from around the world. At last count it stood at around 4900 people, most of whom are trying to claim asylum in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>At it\u2019s largest point shortly after Christmas the camp had over 6000 residents. Living in very harsh, cold conditions through the Northern Europe winter.</p>\n\n<p>Originally the camp was made up of tents and very temporary structures. But from around September last year a number of new charity organisations and volunteer structures made it their plans to help improve the quality of the camp [<a href="http://www.ahomeforwinter.org/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://www.ahomeforwinter.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ahomeforwinter.org/</a>].</p>\n\n<p>The camp is largely made up of young men, although there are small numbers of families, women and young children as well as around 350 unaccompanied children between the age of 12-16. A number of organisations sprang up that work with the women and children on site, provided youth clubs, teaching and English lessons. [<a href="http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/camp-initiatives" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/camp-initiatives</a>] [<a href="http://www.calaisjungleyouth.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.calaisjungleyouth.com/</a>]</p>\n\n<p>The camp has grown up, physically and mentally, over the last 5 years, but has really become a focal point since around 2012. The camp has grown hugely during this time, as well as moving around from site to site.</p>\n\n<p>Alongside the humanitarian and social aid there are library and reading services [<a href="http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/jungle-books-library" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/jungle-books-library" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/jungle-books-library</a>], theatre and arts activities [<a href="http://goodchance.org.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://goodchance.org.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://goodchance.org.uk/</a>], community kitchens [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/OneSpiritAshramKitchen/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/OneSpiritAshramKitchen/</a>][<a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Belgian-Kitchen-1736739086546935/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/The-Belgian-Kitchen-1736739086546935/</a>], hot food distribution, dry food goods distribution and daily clothing distributions provided from a central warehouse [<a href="http://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.laubergedesmigrants.fr/</a>], amongst many others [<a href="http://time.com/4233206/calais-jungle-shops/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://time.com/4233206/calais-jungle-shops/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://time.com/4233206/calais-jungle-shops/</a>].</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more about a numbers of the organisations that work on the site by visiting [<a href="http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/breaking-news" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/breaking-news" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.calaidipedia.co.uk/breaking-news</a>] or by reading the No Borders document [<a href="https://welcometocalais.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/welcome-to-calais-booklet_eng_updatedoct15.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="https://welcometocalais.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/welcome-to-calais-booklet_eng_updatedoct15.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">https://welcometocalais.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/welcome-to-calais-booklet_eng_updatedoct15.pdf</a>]</p>\n\n<p>Although MSF, GWB and Unicef run services on the site, and have provided some care to the camps the site itself is not officially recognised by the French or UK governments, and as such has no requirements to meet basic human rights, or follow local building or health and safety guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, no single government or NGO organisation has responsibility for the activities and structures on camp. Everything that has grown up has happened through self-organisation, communication and collaboration between new and existing charities both French-based and in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Increasingly we are seeing aid, and charities from further afield in Europe coming to Calais to help, creating a multi-national series of solutions that have grown up without any direct hierarchy or guidance.</p>\n\n<p>In March the French prefecture with the support of the CRS cleared the oldest, largest section of the camp in the south. The intention was to rehouse all of the residents in to a number of local official options; including the La Vie Active container camp [<a href="http://julesferry.vieactive.fr/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://julesferry.vieactive.fr/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://julesferry.vieactive.fr/</a>]; the brand new official refugee camp in Dunkirk [<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/12186407/Frances-first-ever-internationally-recognised-refugee-camp-opens-near-Dunkirk.html" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/12186407/Frances-first-ever-internationally-recognised-refugee-camp-opens-near-Dunkirk.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/12186407/Frances-first-ever-internationally-recognised-refugee-camp-opens-near-Dunkirk.html</a>] or into asylum/detention camps around France.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of residents in the camp chose to not take these options as they are not looking to seek asylum in France, but are trying to get to the UK to reconnect with families. This disconnect between what the French authorities want to achieve with the residents and what the residents themselves want to achieve goes a long way toward explaining the conflict and central problem at the camp.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About what i have been doing</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the past 3 weeks I have been working as a volunteer through the central warehouse, L\u2019Auberge des migrants.</p>\n\n<p>L\u2019Auberge acts as the central aid and food distribution services for the camps across Northern France, including Calais, Dunkirk and a number of smaller camps around the area.</p>\n\n<p>L\u2019Auberge exists solely on donations, providing daily hot food deliveries, daily dry food deliveries to allow residents to cook for themselves, clothing drops, and since my arrival a mobile distribution service that goes from shelter to shelter, assessing individual and community needs and providing aid in the form of blankets, sleeping bags, cooking equipment, lights and a number of other personal items.</p>\n\n<p>All of these services are coordinated by long to medium term volunteers, who spend their own money and time to care for the people on camp without receiving any direct pay. Sometimes fundraised money is spent to provide accommodation and travel expenses to volunteers but a large majority of people live out here entirely on the own funds.</p>\n\n<p>The warehouse was initially set up by a French charity but is now run and \u2018staffed\u2019 by a UK charity HelpRefugees [<a href="http://www.helprefugees.org.uk/what-we-do/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://www.helprefugees.org.uk/what-we-do/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.helprefugees.org.uk/what-we-do/</a>], who bring in funding and support from around the EU to help provide humanitarian services.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/03/burying-refugees-die-calais-jungle-160329071028796.html" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/03/burying-refugees-die-calais-jungle-160329071028796.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/03/burying-refugees-die-calais-jungle-160329071028796.html</a></p>\n\n<p>TO BE CONTINUED.....</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CALAIS" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CALAIS" rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CALAIS</a></p>', u'post_id': 39328, u'user_id': 2569, u'timestamp': u'2017-11-14 11:34:08', u'title': u"Welcome to 'The Jungle' - We've got fun and games"}, {u'content': u'<p>As it is officially one week since my workshop today, I have to give you the low down on the microbio results (lower your expectations, sorry!)!</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/ae6c9bba52f923e30eb53c3c3cf021e74e812361" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ae6c9bba52f923e30eb53c3c3cf021e74e812361.jpg" class="lightbox" title="edgerydermicrobioAttempt.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/ae6c9bba52f923e30eb53c3c3cf021e74e812361_1_689x487.jpg" width="689" height="487"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">edgerydermicrobioAttempt.jpg</span><span class="informations">2480x1752 1.9 MB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>', u'post_id': 38825, u'user_id': 3704, u'timestamp': u'2017-10-27 14:46:48', u'title': u'Results of the DIY lab analysis of water contamination in Brussels'}, {u'content': u'<p>Do I want to live a regular, somewhat boring life, or an interesting life?

These questions have been lingering for years, and became more profound after I moved in with my co-workers into <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/spawning-the-reef-brussels-re-inventing-communal-working-and-living-again/6239/1">The Reef Brussels</a>, edgeryders first home base.</p>\n\n<p>I just spent a few good days near Nieklitz (Germany) in a gathering organized by<a href="http://www.openstate.cc/"> Open State</a>, the professional camp builders who built <a href="http://www.poc21.cc/">POC21</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/openstate/posts/1358328040903787">Refugee Open Cities</a>. The camp, funded by <a href="https://advocate-europe.eu/en">Advocate Europe</a>, offered a rare occasion to 30 something activists to slow down and reflect on our work; with yoga, meditation, ecstatic dance intermissions (sic!), and no hard commitment to produce an artefact by the end. One could wander and ponder about whether pairing people with radically different political worldviews changes their civic behavior, but also chat about good apps for practicing mindfulness (I hear it\u2019s Headspace).</p>\n\n<p>Of 40 people around the camp, about half of us were \u201cparticipants\u201d, while the other half were organisers and hosts, an extensive team affiliated to Open State and the place.</p>\n\n<p>It was the Place which really made my camp experience. With scarce Internet and mobile signal, vague appearances of machines, we found ourselves in a nature park with a history, at a two-hour train ride en route from Berlin to Hamburg. Wir Bauen Zukunft (translates We Build Future) aka \u201cthe Nieklitz crew\u201d is a collective that in the beginning of 2016 bought 18 hectares of land with a loan from a generous private person. This was previously a biology park, a multi million euro technical project of a local architect in the late 90s which failed to bring in enough visitors or people to fill spacious workshops. The ensemble had severely deprecated  due to lack of maintenance and use. Since 2016, the Nieklitz crew rebuilt most of it, with a lot of attention for craft and design. It is quite an experience to walk between The Hive main hall and kitchen, the Scent House and House of Flowers, all equipped with a few dozen beds, toilets, indoor and outdoor shower(s); or to walk the green paths between large workshops and storage spaces, old trailers, camping and camp fire spots.

They partially use geotermal energy (underground pipes for heating); research water efficient biogas stoves (to work through methanization); plan an upcoming earthship; organise renovation and building camps on the land. All these build up a sustainable space, with awareness that \u201ceverything we produce we need to sell\u201d, as someone said to me. All would then call for how-to innovation workshops, for others to learn how to do it. They also host organisations/ events to make temporary use of the space, and encourage deeper exchange: permaculture meetings would teach everyone new practices, while experimenting on the Nieklitz land. Like most skilled communities I have seen, the boundaries between those who host and those who cross their path are purposefully blurred.</p>\n\n<p>It also reflects in the group\u2019s structure. Formally, it is a cooperative (in German the legal term is genossenschaft) where members buy-in an amount of 5K to co-own the property. There are 18-20 of them, with many active supporters - Open State itself has contributed large share of the camp funding to equip the space for future uses. About 10 people also live in the space, putting their time and skills into servicing it, but needing to make ends meet in the real world still.</p>\n\n<p>I asked everyone I got the chance about their involvement and how the community develops. The points below are valuable takeaways for me and hopefully for edgeryders<a href="http://openvillage.edgeryders.eu"> OpenVillage</a> in-the-making:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Reaching out to fitting partners in a strategic way.</strong> Securing the resources to get started involved 3 questions: What\u2019s the topic? Who\u2019s around to partner up with? Where does the money come from? It could be that the OpenVillage solves 2) and 3) by being hosted temporarily in a community whose values are aligned, which has the space for us: could be an industrial park, an eco-village, a farmland and so on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Time set aside for planning, group structuring and reflection.</strong> The core group had known each other for about 3 years prior and intersected in various projects. The cooperative model looks promising because in it, members share clear rights, but they also share the responsibility in a way that doesn\u2019t break the structure when someone drops out. Everyone participates in weekly meetings and they apply sociocracy 3.0 to all decision making. Reportedly, it is not easy, but the collective understands that it\u2019s a process and gets help when needed (professional coaches).</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. A healthy mix of working, living, and the space in between</strong> In the Nieklitz group, I found a surprising combination of brain meets the heart meets the hands. It is not a hackerspace with living quarters, nor is it a hippie commune. Or if it is any of them, it escaped me, as I was talking to such diverse people - designers, artists, cooks, planners and highly skilled builders. The space reflects that: as part of the package one can try three different kinds of showers \u2013 the inside shower, the outside shower, and the love shower <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>My own questions about making a life for oneself lingered. It seemed that the deep personal investment of people is not only in making a project happen. Someone I spoke to framed it as having a chance to live the lives we want, outside the oppression experienced in the city. Wir Bauen Zukunft and their extended loving arms like Open State are building future, in much needed radical, but gentle ways.

It brought together local people working on open care solutions. Nearing the end of the session, we discussed our reflections and it came to the issue of collaborating. </p>\n\n<p>I brought up the question \u201cconnecting and collaborating takes substantial time, often too much for this type of projects. So should projects themselves make this risky investment, or is there an external initiative that takes the lead to invest time and resources in it?\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>It was clear to me then that it is a matter of investing upfront, before there\u2019s any tangible outcomes that propel each individual project forward. When the collaboration is rolling, when the incentives are clear, it should be pretty self-sustaining. So the question can be reframed as: who makes the upfront investment?</p>\n\n<p>Last week, the OpenVillage Festival gave us an immersive and powerful experience. Exchanging with such a diverse group of people from all walks of life, thinking deeply, making concrete plans and having fun in a genuine setting. It was grand, quoting Anthony.</p>\n\n<p>On the day after the festival, some of us came together to assess how we could continue the work we\u2019ve been doing. I have been knee deep in trying to make my own projects work, being in survival mode the last months. I had lost track of the bigger picture that was in front of me.</p>\n\n<p>We have all contributed to the journey to OpenVillage that started months ago: the community members, the OpenCare project and the Fellows. But Edgeryders has contributed by far the most and saw the need to get people moving in the same direction. I can\u2019t imagine many would disagree with the value they have gotten out of it so far. Only now, while synthesizing notes several days later, it dawns on me. Everything that has been done, where Edgeryders took a leading role, has been the investment. Will we put to use what has been built?</p>\n\n<p>During the first hours of the Festival, we sat down in groups of three to talk to each other. In their stories, both of my conversation partners posed the question if Edgeryders would be better at walking the talk. Better than who? The system? Our own projects? However it may be, there were clear expectations of the Festival, of Edgeryders.</p>\n\n<p>On the evening of day 2, I sat down again with one of my earlier conversation partners. I asked how his thinking had evolved since the start. He said that he realised the situation was more nuanced than that. \u201cI\u2019ve come to realise we are all Edgeryders, we should step up.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I think that is the essence of where we are at. My own projects have evolved, not in small part thanks to Edgeryders and the Fellowship. We have the capacity for others to benefit from what we have built, with concrete actions. We can give, help others to grow like we did and will step up. </p>\n\n<p>As OpenVillage unfolds, I\u2019m looking out how to contribute and hope to see you there!</p>', u'post_id': 38830, u'user_id': 3362, u'timestamp': u'2017-10-27 15:41:01', u'title': u'OpenVillage: sharing capacity'}, {u'content': u'<p>As I have been encouraged to write a blog post (but when I went to a place where it said \'blog\' I got an error saying that tag is only allowed for certain people) I will start one here with some reflections on the great festival!<br>I am very glad Winnie invited me, something that maybe should go without saying, but I will start with that anyway!  Thanks!!</p>\n\n<p>From the complexities of water presentation by Alberto Rey, to the super fun Urban Games (yay, Hippos!), to the open insulin work and the workshops and masterclasses, it really was so interesting.  Of course I am sorry I missed out on Bernard M\'s discussion and the details about data protection from the afternoon of the second day, but hope somehow (in these pages?) I will manage to catch up!  It is incredibly cool that we finished with Matt M (who my daughters would also really love) and John C (so cool he is advising this group!) giving their take on things, and the final documentary, well I already talked about that elsewhere, but it was really great.</p>\n\n<p>As I got on the plane home, I realised that my current book, Heureux les heureux, by Yasmina Reza, is also very applicable to these topics of open care, open sourcing and open science even - and esp knowing each other... There are even vignettes with people waiting in the doctor\'s office, being brave and pathetic, all at once...  The title is from Jorge Luis Borges, and I will quote: \'Felices los amados y los amantes y los que pueden prescindir del amor.  Felices los felices.\'  </p>\n\n<p>Maybe we can all call ourselves happy just to have been together for those few days, but I am hoping that there will be more to come, even thought I know getting to Morocco to start off next year is certainly not going to happen for me! <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/blush.png?v=3" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"><br>Still I look forward to hearing about it all!<br>And seeing at least some of you (for real, not just in facebook) in the not too distant future! </p>\n\n<p>Now, if I could just find out what those instruments were, that were played during the party (well, at least for one song, outside of the sound check... <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">!  </p>\n\n<p>Thanks again to everyone for their contributions and organisation!</p>', u'post_id': 38707, u'user_id': 3704, u'timestamp': u'2017-10-25 08:26:48', u'title': u'Reflections on the festival'}, {u'content': u'<p><em>[<strong>Editor note:</strong> The following notes were made by <a class="mention" href="/u/alberto">@alberto</a> during the "Harvesting Session", at the end of the first day of OpenVillage Festival (19th October 2017).

Open Insulin and how to prototype it.<br>And clear out the international collaboration that is now emerging in the open insulin research.</p>\n\n<h3>Some history of the project.</h3>\n\n<p>Early 2015 in Counter Culture Labs, biohacker collective in Oakland, developed consensus around the idea that we could make insulin in a lab like their. The idea is worth pursuing, the technology is there. First it was a technical motivation, afterwards it was clear that insulin was a social and economical issue. </p>\n\n<p>Many people don\u2019t have access, it\u2019s bad in the US. Only a few companies have the oligopoly on production globally (US, France, Denmark based).</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s also the fragility of the supply chains. Only major producers in the West, which means that supply is easily disrupted in less developed or accessible regions. We need to rely less on shipping insulin around and maintaining eg. a cold chain. This is a major barrier to getting insulin out where it needs to be. In short, we need to decentralise production.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Science and engineering:</strong><br>Went through one proof of concept iteration in an E. coli bacteria (for troubleshooting methods). Took about a year. We made a precursor protein to insulin. Bacteria however is not able to convert the precursor into insulin, so since early 2017 we\u2019re looking at yeast, because that organism can do everything inside the organism. The protocol needs to be simple and easily reproduced.</p>\n\n<p>6 months - 1 year we will have engineered the strain that does everything. Then we can move to using the strain and producing or scaling up. So the question is now: how do we structure the legal entities to govern the production.</p>\n\n<p>Teams from Ghent (ReaGent) and Sydney (BioFoundry) joined the project. International collaboration is unfolding. We need to organise this better and set up some legal frameworks for sharing the IP that gets generated, keeping the goals of the project in mind, we want to have a commons framework. Allowing entities to use it, but making sure that they do so in keeping with commons principles. </p>\n\n<p>The organisation needs to ultimately be accountable to diabetes patients. It can\u2019t be a misalignment like we have now with the large producers that mainly have a large profit motor. They just keep diabetics dependent, charge high prices, and don\u2019t innovate much otherwise. Prices went up by 1000%, even though production got cheaper.</p>\n\n<p>Many semi-independent manufacturing efforts that are localised, but sharing knowledge. <br>A [diabetes] patient coop would be able to decide how much effort to put into prevention or researching cure vs manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p>The FDA is the biggest player in making this a reality. Big part of this is making a rigorous case and showing the costs of illness and the benefits of our alternative. Depending on how their own incentives work, they might not care. </p>\n\n<p>We have 2 goals, proposal is to split in two groups:</p>\n\n<h3>1. How do we move from here to this cooperative?</h3>\n\n<p>A cooperative as a platform where patients would be the main stakeholders.<br>The patent is not to stop other people from doing it, but to protect the </p>\n\n<p><strong>Characteristics of the agreement:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rate of profit determined by patients<br>Where it is invested is determined by patients.</p>\n\n<p>Example of medical cannabis cooperatives. Maybe we can use it as a template for our organisation. Tailor this to the local jurisdiction. </p>\n\n<p>We need some kind of global scale organisation that holds the IP in custody. Perhaps a Swiss foundation. A public benefit corporation.</p>\n\n<p>Forging alliances with city governments. Show that production at city scale is feasible and show that economic implications they have can be addressed. Eg. problem of people going to emergency rooms, which is a cost for the city, so open source insulin would make the hospital work better.<br>Lucas Gonzales. Epidemiologist. His job is to prepare for flu pandemics in the canary islands. As part of preparing the plan, he found out there\u2019s 8000\u2019s diabetics in the CI and there is no capacity on the island (comes from Germany). So in case of pandemic, they are screwed. This could be an angle.</p>\n\n<p>Synthetic pancreas people. Firewall of FDA and then they appealed to free speech. They don\u2019t sell, yet share the schematics. </p>\n\n<p>Make it look less like a market transaction, and more like a club: participating in the testing. </p>\n\n<p>Analogy to Open Source Ecology. Centralized body of knowledge, localized operation to build machines by doing workshops etc. </p>\n\n<aside class="quote"><div class="title">\n<div class="quote-controls"></div>Chris Cook:</div>\n<blockquote><p>At the global level: memorandum of understanding, but otherwise you\u2019re free to do what you want.</p></blockquote></aside>\n\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Unincorporated association:</strong><br>Agreement, but not in any legal form. 2 pager.

It has a \u2018hatching clause\u2019 which makes it hatch into an actual legal form. </li></ul>\n\n<h3>Action items:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Review relevant structures</li>\n<li>Pitch this to city governments (Milan next month, Oakland, Ghent)</li>\n<li>Have a legal structure, so that funders know where their money goes</li>\n<li>Cali cooperative weed</li>\n<li>Cooperatives in calif and europe (Switzerland?

Winnie can talk about it with the head of strategy for the City of Ghent.</p>\n\n<p><em>In Oakland:</em> never got to the head, always mid or low level managers. You need to get people in power to not necessarily endorse it, but mainly not stop it. An endorsement would really help though.

Several thousands involved. Organizing without state infrastructures. How to avoid relations of domination, hierarchy, specialization. Collective autonomy. Diversity of thoughts, but fascists not welcome. </p>\n\n<h3>How they organize:</h3>\n\n<ul><li>Daft structures<br>cabins, farmhouses, tents. A lot of agriculture with machines, collective gardens - grain and beans to feed a nonmarket and support other struggles.</li></ul>\n\n<p>They built a lot of infrastructure: spaces for tractor mechanics, woodwork, preservation spaces. Weekly newspaper, radio, website zad.nadir.org, welcome houses, internal telecom network. No police, no justice. Conflict mediation group. Autonomous health care. Some people don\'t have health insurance, no legal papers, or access to cars or phone to do paperwork in the city. Fugitives, people traumatized by the medic system. </p>\n\n<h3>4 spaces of care:</h3>\n\n<p>La transfuse cabin for first aid, Trailer Medic for free/cheap medical assistance, Varies Rouge medical house a collective living there similar to a hospital, Medicinal Cabin for storing and drying medicinal plants. </p>\n\n<h3>Varies Rouges:</h3>\n\n<p>Sees 10 25 people a week, medical problems or who want a tattoo for their dog.

One thing is that civic awareness is increasing a lot. When I started working in Milan, it was top down, but now tensions are growing. In Milan we started a crowdfunding: 1300 became donors. They accepted to be engaged. They want a dialog with the public administration. And they aren\u2019t used to that. We didn\u2019t at first know how to manage that, to speak to citizens in a rational way, as a productive practice. </p>\n<p>Something else, public policy, especially top down is very dangerous. In these days, you talk about regenerating suburbs -- it is a public emergency. In the 60s, there were big blocks, without shared spaces, this approach was not public-centric. </p>\n<p>Third, traditional political parties can\u2019t afford a top-down approach, they have no future if they can\u2019t talk to people.

These rules say that if the building isn\u2019t under renovation, that they need to have at least have a temporary ramp, like an aluminum one.

There is a checkbox, a little calculation that the shop owner needs to make for the slope.

A couple of local doctors who liked what we were doing helped us, and paved the way for us to deliver our babies and be self-sufficient, ..<br>If you fast forward some years, our skill levels up and we could try to do good for people besides ourselves. So we founded a nonprofit. I found myself in NYC, in the South Bronx, at the time the poorest place in America. We started a free ambulance service for the people; again, in order to do that, we had to collaborate with local people.</p>\n<p>My point is that here, we set a counter culture of people who are doing good. But, in order for us to fulfil our goals, we had to collaborate with people who belong to the \u201destablishment\u201d and we couldn\u2019t have survived without doing so. </p>\n<p>Later on, we moved onto a new project: starting a free, bilingual clinic in Wash DC, the first of this kind. Again, the same thing: we collaborated with a bunch of doctors who could see the problem. We (the hippies) drove the initial fund raising, and provided the administration and structure behind it. The clinic is still working.</p>\n<p>After this I choose to move on with my family and moved to california, after being there for a few years, offered a job helping with a computer network that I knew nothing about, The WELL (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL</a>). It had itself grown out of a very successful countercultural project, called the Whole Earth Catalogue. \u2026 before that I was fixing cars to support my family.  </p>\n<p>This is the mid 1980s the idea of people who use the computer to talk to others in a network was a new thing, I was hired to help it grow and support it, because of where I come from, when I got there the only thing I could do is to apply what I learned, so I made this term \u201conline community\u201d.</p>\n<p>I tried to help peple to have a meaningful expericne so they feel they are in a community and stay.Some examples\u2026</p>\n<p>One is that we had the big computer , server, was a big box but slow for what we needed and did not have the money to buy a new one, so everybody who are using the system had interest to improve, it. We made this if people paid in advance for the subscription we can buy and improve the system.. The community itself came up with the money to do it </p>\n<p>Another one, a woman was a member of the community decided to go to india and become a buddhist monk , after some months , she became ill terribly. She was going to die. Word got back to us and a doctor in the community found a contact person to work with; and the community itself raised the money to airlift her with a helicopter, take her to the hospital where the doctor\u2019s contact had prepared the ground, and treat her. She could then go back to the monastery. No one, I think saw, here again.</p>\n<p>That the community itself could do so for a person who didn\u2019t see for month and may not see again, this was an incredible experience. It blew us away. We were clearly onto something.</p>\n<p>One thing I found, when going deep with people (not doing something for a week or month, not a collaboration), you are on a journey you make together, not a marriage, but you trust that collectively you can figure it out, </p>\n<p>Some people have leadership roles and some have supporting roles, like in a kitchen , not everyone is a chef. These roles can switch, you can have a supporting role then change and so on. </p>\n</blockquote></aside>\n\n<aside class="quote"><div class="title">\n<div class="quote-controls"></div>\n<img alt="" width="20" height="20" src="//edgeryders.eu/user_avatar/edgeryders.eu/cindy/40/1152_1.png" class="avatar">Cindy:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An innovation setting creates a context where you can deal with uncertainty.

We discovered we could find enough common ground, without necessarily agreeing on 100% of the issues. Our focus on medical care reflects that: we needed it to survive, and it was somehow uncontroversial among the group. Even if we do not agree on the fine points of doctrine, we can still do good work together, and bring about some concrete improvements. The clinic in DC, the ambulance service in NYC, these were concrete, and they were good.

Otherwise, by a literal interpretation of the law, you would be liable if data is leaked through a hack. But this does not make sense, there will need to be precedents in court, that interpret the law considering the scale of the organisation and the scale of the vulnerability or breach.</p>\n\n<p>The law applies to everyone that is active in the European region, even those based outside of it. The US does not have a data protection responsible.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard for the government to do open date, because it is always possible to make links by cross referencing with other data sets.

How it became important in the buddhist culture to wash the bodies of the deceased to wash their bodies in the water and then release them, then water became very polluted, and this stopped, but this was really important for the culture. </p>\n<p>On development of Kathmandu and how it grew from the the 60s till now, there is not enough sewage control, so every stream that feeds in the river is polluted, by the time it leaves the valley the water is black from sewage and industrial waste,<br>Now they have gotten grants to build water treatment units, some were build some were not due to corruption. <br>The hope at this point to clean the water but diluting the water till they get enough water treatment plants.</p>\n<p>This was the art side, now the community side.<br>The fly fishing program We meet every week and reflect on how many insects that live in the stream. <br>Besides fly fishing we talk about the value of water how to evaluate how clean the water is, and we up the stream collect the bugs, and the no of bugs tells us how clean is the water.</p>\n<p>Program started 18 years ago. Lots of underprivileged people ?in the inner city <br>A lot of students went to environmental sciences, these individuals to become stewards of the environment. <br>We provide mentors for the kids and provide a positive role model, that we found that to be very important in these communities </p>\n<p>We realized that there are needs in other communities, it was clear we couldn\'t go for all these communities to do the same, then we started to work with adults, community leaders, teachers, etc so we started a conference and we provide all the equipment and the materials with 50 % discount from the industry for them to start their own program.<br>We host also a steam cleaner, not only clean but plant trees they allows more bugs to survive. <br>We have done 5 conferences already , in the mornings in the classroom and in the afternoon we go to fly fish, and see it as an activity to bring students outside. </p>\n<p>After this we are going to work with communities in new mexico. </p>\n<p>Now working on extinct birds art work collection. As we are facing mass extinction nowadays. </p>\n<p>Last thing that flyfishing does,<br>We started to re introduce this fish species, they are very sensitive to water quality, we fundraised and worked with the youth and adults and we are now fro 7?<br>Years introducing this bruter?<br>Fish to local waters.</p>\n<p>The fish started to migrate to other streams as well.

Regenerate the midwifery movement.</p>\n\n<p>Then to Washington DC, collaborated with some doctors to initiate the first bilingual clinic there. </p>\n\n<p>Then Back to California, fixing cars, then went to work at the WELL, and the whole earth catalogue. Supposed to work on customer support and marketing in time I became to </p>\n\n<p>John became what is now known as an online community manager. He basically invented the field. He had an intense living-working experience.</p>\n\n<p>In 1994 John co-founded the first online news website, SFGate. Combine news articles with community dialog. Help journalism be better, help the community be smart. A hybrid of opinions with fact checked professionally written material.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>What makes the Open Village and The Reef different?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Doing online community, living space and working space together is rare. This is authentic pioneering work. This hybrid of virtual and physical community. Not having them be separate entities, but blend seamlessly into each other. Each depend on each other. They need to be connected.</p>\n\n<p>Open Village is a network of houses with an autonomous network affiliation. The Reef is one of those spaces. The communities need to be shaped by the active participants, yet there are some general things in common.</p>\n\n<p>John offers a toolkit to improve our likelihood of success and how to not screw it up.</p>\n\n<p><em>It\u2019s all about relationships.</em> John wanted to make the online experience as meaningful as possible, foster deep relationships, in the online community. Working honestly and compassionately in the open with each other. It had not been proven, but John had a conviction it would work.</p>\n\n<p><em>A culture of sharing and respect.</em> It must express online and offline in word, deed, ??.<br>It has to be clearly evident to everyone who shows up, lives, works, stays. It\u2019s a commitment and has to be corrected if there are deviations.<br>You have to want the togetherness. You need to be committed. Or the ups and downs will get to you.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Work hard</strong><br>John wasn\u2019t very suited to the community life. But he wanted to be with his community members more than he wanted to remain how he was. He became a hard worker.</li>\n<li><p><strong>Share</strong><br>Don\u2019t let things escalate. Keep it up. Share is a verb, an action, do it, initiate it, don\u2019t wait for someone to do it. It is bad to let things lead to an eruption of conflict.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Be Open and Honest</strong><br>Talk about what limits you want to set. Don\u2019t get mad if someone asks what\u2019s going on. \u201cOh, nothing\u201d is not an answer.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Provide Service</strong><br>Your attention and effort goes beyond your own job, projects and personal interests. If you see something that needs to be done, you pay attention to it and take the initiative to lead it.<br>Don\u2019t be a Complainer, Grouch, Jerk (or worse)<br>Everyone has their moods. Do they drive you, or do you drive them? Don\u2019t let them drive you.<br>Make Time for Fun<br>If it\u2019s no fun, no group will be working for the long haul.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>The magic of affirmation.</em> Encourage someone. Finding something you like in another person and lift him up by telling them. Not like a \u2018like\u2019 on Facebook. Show that you\u2019re paying close attention to a person. You can help grow more of that in the other person by expressing it, bringing it out. Never fake it, if you don\u2019t see it, don\u2019t say it. Be honest. Keep it real, don\u2019t overstate it. \u201cI see your better self in yourself, but what you just said or did does not really express it very well\u201d. It\u2019s not about stoking up ego or building self esteem. Not \u201cyou are great\u201d but \u201cwhat you just did or said is great\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><em>Living Arrangements, maintenance, sustainability.</em> You have to make some decisions about how you maintain things and manage yourselves. Take time to have a conversation about it. Find skills, strengths, go into it with an open mind. It might take some time to do it what works well for everyone, but not doing it will lead to problems down the line. You want to put out a clear sense of being positive people that are an asset to the nearby community.<br>Decent power, good food, good sanitation. A lot of landlords of pretty lax. Someone needs how to not get shocked or overflow the plumbing. Sanitation can kill your community. One richer community failed due to overflowing toilets.<br>Grow strong human connections and commit to those.</p>\n\n<p><em>About the money.</em> No money = no projects, no food, \u2026 Grants do not pay for operations. Sometimes projects net a profit, sometimes not. You need to come up with ways to provide for yourself and this will test the community. Who\u2019s owed, what is owed? What\u2019s on him? You can\u2019t mess this up, or it\u2019s a big hole in your boat. What\u2019s your own money, what\u2019s the group money?<br>You and the group need to decide how the rent will be paid. Are you willing to pool your money and then decide to spend it? John lived without any own money for 12 years.</p>\n\n<p><em>The projects that make the money.</em> Is everyone in the kitchen the chef? How much ownership do you have over projects? Is there commercial potential? Do you know how to read a contract?<br>How would you feel like it\u2019s your job to make money for the group, rather than working on your own ideas and projects? Or is the well-being of the whole group more important for you? Are you willing to set aside your own project for a time? Are you able to set yourself aside for a while, working for the whole? Over the long haul, roles can change and reverse at times. John worked a long time \u2018sacrificing for the whole\u2019, working as a mechanic, maintaining appliances. But then he raised seed money for the clinic. You just never know what\u2019s going to happen. You need to pay attention, be committed, and it may just fall on you to be the catalyst that turns the key.<br>Can you think of ways to combine projects? Be more than the sum of the whole.<br>Leave your ego at the door.</p>\n\n<p><em>Who decides what?</em> Will you decide through one person? Consensus? Decide on yourself. Be thorough and not attached to just your own personal desires. Who is good at what? What about chores? Everybody should be involved in basic household work and (the usually more fun) project work. If you see something that needs to be fixed, don\u2019t just walk away: step up.<br>The project leader is not necessarily the leader in the living arrangements (important for working-living situations). Perhaps individuals with natural leadership, but it is not a given that this authority carried over to the home situation. It\u2019s about claiming or granting an authority role.</p>\n\n<p><em>Stay healthy.</em> People living together share a lot of germs. Pay attention to basic hygiene. What if everyone gets the flu?<br>John has a hepatitis B story. Someone came and cooked, infected everyone. Bad stuff, could barely function.</p>\n\n<p><em>Privacy and personal space.</em> At what point does your personal space spill over to the common? Where do you draw the lines? John lived in a complete transparency, mental nudist community. It served him well as an experience in every community situation afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t escape into your Phone. Don\u2019t obsess to remove yourself from the group. Or you\u2019ll miss it. Alienation can begin in the tiniest things.</p>\n\n<p><em>Visitors*.</em> You want to convey a business like feeling. There needs to be a reason for someone to hang out longer.</p>\n\n<p><em>Living and Working.</em> The online space. Have physical meetings. Have parties. The people who are not face to face, but are online, still benefit from the bonding that the people who do meet physically have done. Magical! And vice verse. The whole network gets stronger from different relationship building. The online is a good diary, everything is searchable, but the diary needs to be available by serious documentation and linking and structuring.</p>\n\n<p><em>Managing online community.</em> Someone will be main point person, but everyone needs to know how to do this stuff well. There needs to be consistency. Even when there is debate online. Finding commonalities by discussing differences. You want your online self to be close as possible to who you are in person. Not knocking roleplaying; but this is how Edgeryders does it. You can\u2019t be too casual on how you accomplish that. You want your work to be as if your speaking naturally, but you are crafting your words so that it seems like you\u2019re spontaneously communicating. You need to compensate for the loss of that you can\u2019t communicate through words. That takes effort. Make your communication \u2018hyperreal\u2019. Project yourself deliberately. Being real is important, and consciously set out to achieve this to get to a place of deeper connection.</p>\n\n<p><em>Model the behavior you want to see in others.</em> Zen master: the main point is to keep trying. That\u2019s why they call it practice. The online environment is restricted to words, pictures, videos, but there is an emotional subcarrier that goes out together. And they will be received and felt by the people at the other end. Hippies called it the \u2018vibes\u2019. </p>\n\n<p><em>Be Someone everybody trusts.</em> Vouch for people and they will vouch for you. Ultimately trust is the basis for everything functioning. Otherwise everything falls on the ground. Many people who are smart and socially capable, had however not experienced the community feeling, the bigger picture. Yet it is the essential part of coming together. John was the trusted person that initially brought everything together. This was a crucial way that this group of talented people became something they themselves called a community.</p>\n\n<h3>The hats you wear</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Leader</strong><br>Give all  a place to talk, meet and collaborate. Yet Edgeryders is not a democracy. Someone is responsible at the end. You have responsibilities as leader</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Participant</strong><br>You participate, even as you maintain your leader status. You need to participate well, then you will also lead the group to deeper understanding.</p></li>\n<li><strong>Moderator</strong></li>\n<li><p><strong>Mediator</strong><br>Arguments happen. Usually it resolves without intervention. But when you do intervene, do it without expression of your own opinion.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Helpdesk</strong><br>There will be people who don\u2019t know how to do something. Help them, or they will go away.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Librarian</strong><br>You need to know where things are, link to related material. Help people find out things.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Analyst</strong><br>How many people do you have? How do they participate? How long are they here? Weave them into the story you tell to people who support or fund you.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>The Devil is in the details.</em> You can\u2019t really multitask in real time. Your brain just does really fast switching, not really multitasking. When you wear multiple hats, you\u2019re going to have to be really good at switching. Full attention here, then quickly somewhere else.<br>People involved in \u2018visionary\u2019 work, often don\u2019t like admin. Yet it needs to be done well, it can endanger projects. It is pivotal. There can\u2019t be mistakes or the consequences will be big. If you\u2019re good at it, you should step up. Pay attention to the details. Being good at the admin details will net you respect from people who are more business or financially minded.</p>\n\n<p><em>Authority versus authoritarian.</em> Authority is recognized by others and reinforced. Authoritarian is processes and rules that enforce without optimizing for what actually is important for the community. Make sure that, when you grab the wheel, you know what you\u2019ll be doing. Don\u2019t act like you\u2019re right all the time, just because you\u2019re the \u201cmanager\u201d. Admitting your mistakes and striving not to repeat them, actually builds more trust you\u2019ll need to do your work.</p>\n\n<p><em>IRL (In Real Life).</em> In fact it\u2019s all real life. You want to be as close to your real self as you can get. You can to project onto others what you think is the best of yourself. Show that you\u2019re being honest and your intentions are good, that you\u2019re part of something bigger.</p>\n\n<p><em>Regarding negativity.</em> Conflict and negativity are inevitable. Yet it does not need to dominate any group. It is not healthy to suppress unexamined feelings or thoughts if they are unpleasant or inconvenient. Get objective enough about the negative to prevent it from spreading, and to fix it. Not about being fake happy, but separating what you want to say from the emotion you are experiencing that is driving you to say it. Don\u2019t make it worse by projecting the full load of negative feelings you may have: mindfulness. Don\u2019t let it go too far. Everyone knows how it feels to be on the receiving end of a rant. Everyone experiences a bad mood. How do you straighten it out? First: separate informational content from the emotion of it.</p>\n\n<p><em>Conflict.</em> Easy to get in, hard to get out. It applies everywhere, online and offline. It seems like people are calibrated to misunderstand each other. We need to figure out how to rise above it. Good news: conflict can strengthen bonds (as well as weakening it). Your bond is stronger if you know that can resolve it, because you have in the past. It is important to carry this with you. You will always know that you have done this. Do not seek conflict, yet do not avoid it if you have to go there.</p>\n\n<p><em>When do you talk about it?</em> What is your business, what is someone else\u2019s business and not yours? Sometimes it does work without addressing it. Relationships often have a \u201choneymoon\u201d phase. Where everything is \u201cawesome\u201d. The longer you know someone, the more things you find you don\u2019t actually like that much. You want to avoid a buildup of irritation that becomes to hard to sort out, because you have lost the trail where it got sorted. Can you let it go, or do you need to talk about it? Some people are just not aware that what they do bothers other people, and they don\u2019t mind being told. But you don\u2019t want to be the behavior police, straightening people out. As a default, it\u2019s better to say things than not say them.</p>\n\n<p>Am I the problem, or are you the problem? Ask yourself before you blurt out. Problems in a relationship are never 100% one or the other.</p>\n\n<p><em>Receiving feedback can be hard.</em> Sometimes giving it is even harder. Getting defensive, it\u2019s difficult to have empathy. It\u2019s hard to give this feedback in an open and trusted way You can\u2019t erupt. You need to work on it together?

It struck me that we ought to be looking at open wetware and synthetic biohacking in Opencare. Because there is a lot of scope for DIY and citizen science to actually make advances in developing new care solutions. There are many areas where this could help us to solve pressing problems like antibiotics resistance.</p>\n\n<p>Bengt mentioned an experimental<a href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:Harvard/2007/Brainstorming/"> initiative to use some of the properties of silk produced from recombinant bacteria to break quorum sensing</a>. This means you break cell-cell communication within and across bacterial species. It matters because this is a contributing factor to a number of clinically relevant things like making harmless bacteria produce enzymes which attack host tissues, produce toxins, stick to hosts and protect themselves while outside hosts. It may also be a way to break their antibiotic resistence\u2026.</p>\n\n<p>The reasoning is that antibiotics typically kill or prevent proliferation of bacteria by targeting biomolecules involved in such essential processes as cell wall synthesis, DNA proliferation, or protein synthesis. Treating large populations of bacteria with such agents inevitably selects for a few resistant mutant cells. These proliferate, mutate further, and give rise to antibiotic resistant populations. So you want to get at the entire propulation and since the ability to communicate with one another affects behavior of the entire community....</p>\n\n<p><strong>What makes these kinds of intiatives especially interesting is that they are being done in hackerspaces and garages using equipment that anyone can put together from recycled materials.</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are already examples where unleashing scientific experimentation amongst the citizenry at large has exceeded expectations.The <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/drug-research-thinking-inside-the-malaria-box/a-17239829">Malaria Box</a> was an experimental initiative in which 400 diverse compounds with antimalarial activity were distributed in a bid to catalyse drug discovery and research for neglected diseases such as malaria. At a recent medical conference I heard that this initative <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jul/24/open-source-drug-discovery-research">resulted in several breakthroughs</a> and a number of patents shortly after it was launched.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve only begun to scratch at the surface and have come across the Registry of Standard Biological Parts - a growing collection of genetic parts use for building biological devices and systems and IGEM (\u201cwhere future life scientists go to get their freak on\u201d). You can see the mind boggling list of what participants have come up with here (click on <a href="http://igem.org/Previous_iGEM_Competitions">"team abstracts" from previous iGem competitions here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>What could be achieved if many more people were engaging in this kind of open experimentation?

For those of you who don\'t know me, I\'m Open Care\'s ethnographer --- I have been reading everyone\'s stories, growing increasingly more inspired, and making sure that the important connections you all are making do not get lost. A lot of the time, ethnographers consider themselves to be research instruments -- so maybe think of me as another technology, like the platform itself or the cool visualisations the research team has been producing <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>But it has become increasingly difficult for me to feel I am fulfilliing my role as an ethnographer, because one of the central tenets of ethnographic practice is participant-observation. Now, I\'ve certainly done plenty of observing. But I think I have been dropping the ball slightly on the participant part! Talking about my own positionality is important to making sure that I am filtering everyone else\'s through lenses that don\'t distort them.</p>\n\n<p>So here\'s one of my Open Care stories.</p>\n\n<p>I have two related questions: how do we care for people in our communities who aren\'t visibly ill, yet whose lives are made more difficult by invisible illnesses keeping them from living life the way they want to? And how can we look outside current medical frameworks to help people whose illnesses haven\'t been successfully helped by existing medical frameworks? This issue of invisible illness particularly affects labor, which as many of you have noted, is both a crucial part of what it means to be human (working on things that enrich us, feeling like we have autonomy and are masters of our own destiny) but also something that can cause us pain (when we have to do jobs we don\'t like, or can\'t find employment in this rapidly changing world).</p>\n\n<p>These questions hit particularly close to home for me. I suffer from vestibular migraines (also called migraine-associated vertigo). This means that about three out of seven days a week, I feel dizzy for part or all of the day. If you\'ve ever felt motion sick, you\'ll be able to understand the feeling, although it\'s difficult to describe if you haven\'t. The way I often laughingly put it: It\'s like being drunk, but without the fun parts. During these episodes, I am very nauseated and is really unpleasant to look at screens, read, or generally do anything except stare at a wall. Sometimes the episodes will be extreme: like the whole world is spinning, and I can\'t tell which way is up.</p>\n\n<p>When this first started happening, about a year ago, it was terrifying. I would panic, which would make it much worse.</p>\n\n<p>In the first six months, I tried everything. I went to my GP, who referred me to an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist (ENT). I had to wait months to see her, and she ran all kinds of tests on me: I was put in a dark room, spun around in a chair, water was ran through my ears. Inconclusive--- I had inner ear damage, yet my body was correcting for it. I was referred on to a neurologist (another long waiting period), who told me that vertigo is really hard to do anything about. She diagnosed me with vestibular migraines, and then proceeded to try out 5 separate drugs over 5 months. For weeks I\'d try something new, have terrible side effects, without improvement. I learned that most drugs have side effects, and a lot of drugs are used to treat secondary conditions but the primary use has serious effects (they tried anti-depressants, which can help but made me feel awful, for example).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, after 2 trips to the emergency room in 2 months, she recommended I try a blood pressure medication. That was the last straw for me---- I looked at the bottle, read the side effects (I already had low blood pressure--- so the side effects were, you won\'t believe it, DIZZINESS). I decided to give up on medication for a while. I want to add here that most of this journey took place in the USA, so the medical bills were beginning to pile up.</p>\n\n<p>So I turned to the internet, and found many people suffering like me, without help from medication, and with the same exact symptoms. I don\'t have any wonder cure to report here---- but it was nice to know that other people were there, and were also frustrated by the medical system. I also took solace in my family in the times I was able to see them, who would come and sit with me when an episode hit. Talking to others, taking my mind off of it, helped.</p>\n\n<p>But one of the hardest things was not wanting to tell people, because I didn\'t want them to see me differently or treat me like I was infirm. I didn\'t want to lose my job, and I didn\'t want my PhD supervisors to stop pushing me and giving me new opportunities. I felt that short-term illnesses people are compassionate about, but when there is no end in sight, eventually your lowered performance is no longer a case for compassion, regardless of the cause. I empathised with this position, knowing how frustrating it would be to have a colleague or a friend who disappeared for days at a time. Perhaps most of all, I didn\'t want anyone to treat me like I was disabled. I didn\'t want anyone to treat me differently at all, and I wanted their expectations of me to remain high.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, my illness was invisible. No one could see my suffering, so no one knew to reach out and help. Sometimes we do need to be treated differently, and sometimes we just can\'t go it alone. I told my supervisor at last, and told him that I wanted to move back to the UK --- my home, and a place which, though the medical system was struggling, had universal healthcare and wouldn\'t charge me to get the help I could need in the future. I wouldn\'t have to be scared to go to the emergency room after a day of excruciating pain and nausea. So he ended up supporting me immensely with my goal of transferring my PhD, and I\'m moving back soon.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve started down a new path, now. I don\'t know if it will be helpful, but I\'m starting to acknowledge that I might never be "cured," and that maybe that rhetoric ignores the way that most people with illnesses end up living their lives despite it, rather than conquering it. I think there are a lot of us out there learning how to live in peace with our unruly bodies, and I have found a lot of support and solidarity from friends, who after I confide in them, end up telling me secrets of their own. One has IBS, and has near-constant stomach problems. She told me a story: I don\'t think of myself as disabled, I think of my body as a Maserati. Sure, I have to be really careful about what I fill myself up with, but that\'s because my body is a luxury car! I laughed when she said it, and I carry that story with me. I am filling up my arsenal with other stories of resilience in spite of medical systems which offer no answers, or the wrong ones, and in spite of bodies that don\'t behave.</p>\n\n<p>I have also learned to be mindful of the fact that other people around me are probably struggling with something they\'re not saying. I don\'t give angry looks at people on the tube who sit in priority seats---- what do I know about their conditions? Instead of being upset with friends who cancel plans, or co-workers who seem to show up less, I give them the benefit of the doubt. Who knows what they\'re dealing with.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, I see the stories I have heard as an ethnographer in past projects on technology and health and social care with new eyes, and I feel more strongly about projects to build social solidarity and informal networks more than ever. I for one will continue to do research and publish on these issues, and help design better systems. People are the answer.

There is a desire to reappropriate knowledge around healthcare, because we find it important to decentralize knowledge related to our bodies, but also as a response to the difficulties in relationship to classical institutions of healthcare : the ambulances blocked by law enforcement, the routine collaboration of hospitals with police, and the disdain and non-respect of consent lived by some. There is the desire to learn and share knowledge about more holistic ways of healing and which is not dependent on the pharmaceutical industry. There is the desire to reinforce social movements by propagating knowledge about emergency care and to form new groups. </p>\n\n<p>These projects are independent but they are all entangled with elements of herbalism introduced into our street medic practices, trainings which bring new participants into the medic teams, and our experiences on the ground which nourish the content of the trainings. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The street medics</strong></p>\n\n<p>As soon as we show disagreement in concrete ways,  or we block the smooth unfolding of increasing profit, repression quickly follows.  Whether for the duration of a demonstration or because we live together on an outlawed zone , or when we are labeled \xab undesirable \xbb or \xab protestors \xbb, the State wounds and kills at the hands of law enforcement. </p>\n\n<p>Consious of these risks, in many countries revolutionary groups and activist movements have developed their own medical support networks for demonstrations or direct actions. This dynamic is different than humanitarian practices like the Red Cross, because we don\u2019t pretend to be neutral. We take a clear political stance and an active role in the conflict, and in the support that we bring to our comrades in struggle.</p>\n\n<p>In a demonstration, street medic teams try to be present on the scene as early as possible to be able to provide emergency care to people who ask for it , and to evaluate the needs of the situation before an ambulance arrives, which is sometimes blocked or diverted by the police. There is also an assessment of the legal risks in the case of recourse to official emergency care : for example, identity controls and arrests inside the hospitals to take in people without papers, people with outstanding warrants, or just because the simple fact of being wounded makes someone a suspect. </p>\n\n<p>Law enforcement regularly update their equipment dedicated to repression with new chemical, electrical and physical weapons. As street medics, we try to respond by spreading techniques of defense developed on the ground and shared across the world for preventing, protecting, and healing. </p>\n\n<p>For us, medical knowledge is accompanied by a political reflection in how we put it into practice, to avoid reproducing as much as possible relationships of domination, administration, and dispossession that the medical institution exerts. Our desire as street medics is to put the first priority on the consent of injured people and to give them the information to make clear and informed choices for themselves. \t</p>\n\n<p><strong>The street medic team of the Zad</strong></p>\n\n<p>On the zad there is a medic team which represents an autonomous medical presence during demonstrations and actions, including during past and possible future evictions, but also being present on the ground for medical emergencies when they happen. The medic team brings together people who are interested in that role, with or without official training (there are very few people with professional backgrounds). We organize together to get the knowledge and the material necessary to be able to be autonomous in actions or demonstrations. </p>\n\n<p>Daily healthcare plays an important part in our work. There is a house with a living collective where many medics live, and people can pass through with their injuries or health problems for material, care, advice, and contacts. We evaluate the person and depending on their desires and the capacity of the individual who is treating them (knowledge in first aid, conventional medicine, or herbalism), either we treat them or we direct them to further care.  For this we have contacts with medical professionals we trust (nurses, doctors, osteopaths, homeopaths\u2026) who are in exchange and relationship with us. </p>\n\n<p>There is also a medic trailer, to make sure that we are not the only way tfor people to have access to medical materials. It is left open, and stocked with first aid materials to use there, and material and information for harm reduction linked to drug use and sexual practices. </p>\n\n<p>We also are part of a network of healthcare workers involved in the struggle against the airport. During the evictions of autumn 2012, a number of healthcare professionals came to support the medics on the ground. Over the years, we have worked together to prepare logistical and communications strategies, and to have the materials necessary in the case of eviction attempts or other police intervention. We also have regular discussions, and regular reciprocal trainings. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The herbalism projects</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the past six years, a dynamic around medicinal plants has been developing and made concrete by the creation of a medicinal garden, a dispensary, the creation of an autonomous phytotherapy school, the organisation of plant walks, and of trainings on the uses of plants and how to prepare them. There is a clinic project in the early stages, with regular individual consultations for chronic conditions, and drop in clinic days for more acute illness. </p>\n\n<p>As many other projects which co-inhabit this zone, care by plants is rooted for us in a logic of long term struggle and autonomy, in conflict with the State and capitalist logics. As we try different ways to live, to resolve conflicts without legal intervention, to organize with many people with a diversity of positions and practices in the same territory, we take the liberty to be autonomous in care. We don\u2019t want the world of the pharmaceutical industry, and of the disempowerment of bodies by a vertical and imposed system. We want to play an active r\xf4le in the expansion of a method of accessible, understandable, and participative care which opens up new paths towards more knowledge of our bodies and the plants that surround us. </p>\n\n<p>With a local support group we have built a cabin which serves as a lab for making and storing medicine, a place for distribution, for care, and passing on knowledge. From this place we offer different forms of consultations- individual, but also other times where we see people in a more collabotative exchange, to be able to share skills and learn together with the person seeking care, while having access to the dispensary so that we move together beyond a theoretical level. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Street medic trainings</strong></p>\n\n<p>The training group was created after realizing that the militant french networks were relatively poorly organized in terms of street medics, in comparison with other European countries or in North America. The street medic trainings are intended as a tool for improving our capacity to self-defence by contributing to the existence and multiplication of street medic teams in france and neighboring countries.</p>\n\n<p>The trainings are done for specific geographic areas, to encourage the creation of local groups who can continue to practice and organize together.</p>\n\n<p>The group was formed around self-training in relationship to first aid ; it consists of mainly non healthcare professionals involved in social struggles, with diverse levels of skill and experience. </p>\n\n<p>The complete nine day trainings focus mainly on the most likely injuries in the case of demonstations or riots, the possible complications or aggravations of illness in these moments (stress, fatigue, cold, etc.) as well as psychoemotional injury. We have added a part about the weapons used by law enforcement and about advice for medics in action situations (organization, prevention\u2026), as well as moments dedicated to harm reduction in sexual practices and in drug use. The content is based on classical western emergency care, with (for now) a partial integration of techniques of herbalism.</p>', u'post_id': 36154, u'user_id': 3992, u'timestamp': u'2017-09-13 20:03:08', u'title': u'Dynamics of Autonomous Healthcare on the ZAD'}, {u'content': u'<p>What Protocol for the individual inside a collective?</p>\n\n<p>This article is my preparation for one of the sessions at OpenCare Village: Infrastructure for autonomy<br>Through analyse of some of the structures I\u2019m or was part of, I want to set a parameter of personal care. I think I will have more questions then answers at the end of the ride, but lets still try to make a fruitful read.</p>\n\n<p>First, you have to know i was diagnosed with mild borderline personality disorder a couple of years ago. While the most extreme outrages are now under control i still can have anxiety attacks that will block me, for a couple of days and i will be unreliable to contact or connect with. Knowing that most of my job is organizing events, being a project manager in small or larger groups, makes it quite a challenging. I learned to organize my life in such way that other people are bothered the least possible way and can enjoy my highs as much as possible. Some people in my entourage understand very well this liability, but in formal or new structures it is sometimes difficult to be at ease.</p>\n\n<p>Through my reflection, I came across organic, collectively growing and peer to peer organization as the most suitable for myself as a person but also for people in need of a more humane approach inside organizations. In absolute terms, I see these collective entities as a machine fed by every participant regardless of the level of energy they put in, but giving back to a general audience: the collective or even broader: society. They are well engineered by core members but give place for anybody else to check in and out without to much of a change of creating conflicts, something I personally can quite difficultly manage. It\u2019s not \u2018the end by al means\u2019, but succeeding the goal while the people inside are respected as an entity. Because why would we be frustrated if at the end collectively the goal succeeded even if the energy wasn\u2019t spread evenly between the participants.  True: it sounds less engaging, but it opens a world post-individuality, where you don\u2019t need strong individual leaders all the time, but an organic set of connections between a larger group believing in the higher goal altogether.</p>\n\n<p>In the next couple of paragraphs, I will present to you a couple of organizations I had the pleasure to work with, create or follow up. Each with their own structures, positive sides and biases. I will try to speak from a personal angle without criticizing any other member as I find it an important thinking exercise to help build the structure were within the people can thrive and not criticize the members for the way you want the collective to be.</p>\n\n<p>Soft Revolution / Pic Nic The Streets</p>\n\n<p>These were my first experiences with organic organizations. The first was an artist collective drenched in the Do It Yourself spirit created by myself and a bunch of friends. We organized festivals, created a board game, wrote a book and made some meta-expositions. Through almost ten years of working together we learned from each other flaws and only worked on something when it was suitable for the whole group. What kept us going was our kindness towards each other, our understanding of the human being. But when we arrived at the crossroad between continuing an amateurish journey or professionalizing our collective we chose the second one. Not knowing the stressful implication, it had within the group while we all were stepping into our professional work environment (we started our collective when we were 16-17 till we were 24-25), we couldn\u2019t deliver the last couple of installations and had to dismantle our collective. I still hold great strengths and knowledge from this time and use it as important building stone for any other organization. Understanding each other flaws and not judging them but embracing them is something I would love to share with anybody else. We are always eager for perfection and showing the best. But if to get to that best, you have to care less about the other then it hasn\u2019t any meaning for me. It\u2019s not an absolutism, but a constant work in balance.</p>\n\n<p>Another story happening around the same time goes with Pic Nic The Streets, a citizen movement started in 2012 that wanted to fight for more public space by picnicking on the main boulevard Anspach. For a couple of years, we organized systematic pic nicks, resulting in a carfree central lane, but also in spin-offs like Canal Park for a big park at Porte De Ninove and Cyclo Guerilla for more bike lanes. It was a thriving time for City activists but ended up in a lot of ego-fights and underlying conflicts between activist groups that maybe wanted the same, but had a nuanced approach that resulted in conflicts. I was really saddened about this rivalry between people wanting to look for each other and better the world. Sometimes it became a toxic environment where people found it more important to be right then to care for his or her fellow activist. That is where my enthusiasm for classic activism stopped. But luckily for me there were lots of alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>POC21 / Edgeryders</p>\n\n<p>In the summer of 2015, one of my projects (V\xe9lo M2) was selected for the 5-week innovation camp in an abandoned castle near Paris. I wasn\u2019t prepared at all for the mind-blowing experience that would impact the way I think and live from then on. POC21 was a temporary place where every day around 100 people lived and worked together around 13 projects. The symbiosis that occurred there was one of kind. I think the biggest reason of their success was the creation of an immediate trust between all participants. We were into it for the same narrative and will do it together. By creating a taskboard with everything that was needed to do to keep the machine rolling without taking account that everybody gave equal amount of energy it created another way of working. Not guild trapping you in doing it, but giving you the space for the things you wanted to do. Of course it wasn\u2019t always as perfect and I think the architects of the project had a lot of conflicts, but almost all the time it occurred in an open discussion. There was the space to doubt, to fail, to negotiate the coming or not of the president of France, \u2026</p>\n\n<p>Having met really great people at POC21 I came in touch with Edgeryders, where I started writing occasionally for. While it wasn\u2019t at a first glance the most intuitive platform, I loved the vibe coming from the comments while writing pieces. No easy comments, but moments of thoughtful sharing. I was invited for LOTE4 and continued to engage into the conversation. The word \u2018conversation\u2019 is for me the best way to describe what Edgeryders is, a constant conversation with fellow humans about deeper subjects. I know how hard some of the Edgeryders core members fight for the organization, but what I always loved about the structure is the easy switcheroo between being active and passive in the organization. I curated an event around care at Huis VDH for them and learned much about the organization as about my own skills. Without any problem, I was able to switch to being a passive member again while feeling no pressure to do more or be more involved. That organic feel is something I really appreciate. I understand those core members are an important asset, but giving the opportunity for others to wander around inside the collective is a great way to care for our members.</p>\n\n<p>CIN / V\xe9lo M2</p>\n\n<p>Where the first example was a background introduction and the second a more or less ideal situation, the third kind of organizations are the one I search the most answers for. Civic Innovation Network is a platform where I\u2019m now an occasional \u2018scenarist\u2019 for and V\xe9lo M2 is a project I created with a couple of engineers. Both have a massive potential, both are now connected through a possible fund I helped creating, but in both I can\u2019t find my ideal place as an individual. I asked myself multiple times why I wasn\u2019t able to fit the narrative. When for example I got more and more involved in CIN my anxieties where getting higher and less manageable. CIN is achieving great things, but every time I\u2019m hesitating in what my place is in it.   The demanded structure at V\xe9lo M2 with weekly meetings and monthly working sessions made me feel trapped and again scared. And then the question occurred: in an environment where Open Source, collectiveness but also growth is a key feature is it the individual that needs to adapt towards the collective or is it the collective that has to be flexible towards each individual it encounters. For growing and likewise still learning entities it looks like it\u2019s important to create long-lasting mechanisms, structures that helps stabilize the organization for a fruitful future.</p>\n\n<p>But then the ethical questions arise, what do we do with those that can\u2019t, or are less able to manage a structured, framed context and need the flexibility. Is it a task for the collective to look after them, to simply understand them, and loose maybe some momentum because of the lacking stability or is it the individual that needs to understand or made clear what he or he can\u2019t do? In the couple of years I\u2019m struggling with my anxieties I often chose the second one. For example at my main job at Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival it took me almost three years to create the right balance between creating my own agenda following my ups and downs, trying to explain that to my colleagues and knowing that in the two week period of the festival I need to fight ANY possible anxiety because of the fact that I manage 150 guests for that period of time. At Fermenthings, a shop I own with a friend, before starting I gave him one task that I would not work on from minute one: it was paperwork. I don\u2019t understand the logic of the bureaucracy and it simply blocks me to work on anything else. I know it would be a stumbling-block for the whole organisation. Thanks to a lot of attempts and fails I\u2019m starting to understand better what my role can be. I love to create, to enthusiasm people and structure vision, but I need organized and stable people around me to compensate my lack of consistency.</p>\n\n<p>I felt so often overwhelmed and helpless trying to understand myself. I would have loved to find people, feeling the same struggles or questions willing to create the right protocol, so maybe through this OpenCare Village festival we could open the discussion about care of the individual inside the collective. I didn\u2019t expect to write such a personal paper, and for those I made unease with it, I apologies. But my only hope through this is a better understanding of each others \u2018condition humain\u2019 and maybe we would find collective answers for the individuals through this mean.</p>', u'post_id': 37973, u'user_id': 3293, u'timestamp': u'2017-10-09 20:16:42', u'title': u'What Protocol for the individual inside a collective?'}, {u'content': u'<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/1db2ca17373c8a6c3e49a3a3f7ee8c5166501aa2" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1db2ca17373c8a6c3e49a3a3f7ee8c5166501aa2.jpg" class="lightbox" title="ALBERTO REY by David Moog 150_Smaller.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/1db2ca17373c8a6c3e49a3a3f7ee8c5166501aa2_1_377x500.jpg" width="377" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">ALBERTO REY by David Moog 150_Smaller.jpg</span><span class="informations">676x896 162 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<h1>Alberto Rey</h1>\n\n<p> <em><span class="hashtag">#documentary</span> <span class="hashtag">#art</span> <span class="hashtag">#cleanwater</span> <span class="hashtag">#flyfishing</span> <span class="hashtag">#filmmaking</span> <span class="hashtag">#sciencecommunication</span></em></p>\n\n<p><em>Alberto is an Distinguished Professor at the State University of New York in Fredonia, has been the founder and director of a youth fly fishing program for 18 years and is a fly fishing guide.

Open Village what I understand is a physical manifestation of what happens on the digital collaboration with members from Edgeryders. I relate to it because I work on community building and that is local, but my scope is always much broader, and the only way to collaborate in a broader sense is to be open to digital collaboration.

The world needs more economical sources of insulin because <a href="http://www.100campaign.org/get-involved/know-the-facts/" rel="nofollow noopener">1 in 2 people</a> who need it lack access to insulin worldwide, and this burden falls disproportionately on the poorest communities. Longer term, we hope that by starting with insulin we can broaden our scope to develop more general protein engineering capabilities and provide a practical foundation for small-scale\xa0groups working in distributed fashion\xa0to experiment with and produce other biologics.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re very near to reaching our first milestone of producing and isolating proinsulin, after which we\'ll be redoubling our efforts to develop a simple, end-to-end protocol to produce insulin. We\'ve had several collaborators join our effort in the meantime, including a group at <a href="http://reagentlab.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">ReaGent</a> in Belgium, another at <a href="http://foundry.bio/new2/oligo%E2%82%82insulin/" rel="nofollow noopener">Biofoundry</a> in Sydney, and another here with us in the Bay Area at <a href="https://www.fairaccessmedicines.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Fair Access Medicines</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What have we learned about having citizens define and help advance our research project?</h2>\n\n<p>Our team has benefitted from participation from people with a broad diversity of backgrounds and interests - from veterans of producing biologics at pharmaceutical companies, to people with PhDs and years of work experience in relevant fields, to college students and total beginners who are just interested in starting to learn\xa0and contribute. The sharing of knowledge and responsibilities\xa0within our group thus mirrored what we were seeking to support beyond the group.</p>\n\n<h2>How do we ensure long term sustainability for our project?</h2>\n\n<p>We originally raised a little over $15k to get started via a crowdfunding campaign, a small budget that has nonetheless proven adequate. We\'ve been fortunate that we\'ve been able to stretch our financial resources a long way with donated and deeply discounted second-hand equipment and reagents, and the contributions of skilled volunteers to keep our equipment running. Thus we have no recurring expenses, which has proven to be the most important way to conserver resources and keep the project sustainable in its high-risk seed phase. This has put us on a firm foundation to\xa0reach our first milestone, the production and isolation of proinsulin, the first major step on the way to making the mature, active form of insulin. Once that is done, we plan to pursue our next steps and undertake whatever further fundraising effort we may need to do so, possibly involving a distributed ownership structure and holding and sharing of the fruits of our efforts under some sort of <a href="https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License" rel="nofollow noopener">peer production license</a>\xa0to ensure we develop a viable commons around our work.</p>\n\n<p>Challenges we still face are keeping continuity in the work of the group and preservation and transmission of knowlege as members join and leave the project, something that is becoming more urgent with our developing international collaborations. The urgent questions of distributing the work effectively and making good use of everyone\'s time and enthusiasm and providing all involved with the support they need has us eager to develop better organization and get people with better organizational skills involved; let us know if you can contribute in these ways!</p>\n\n<h2>How do we encourage change at policy level?</h2>\n\n<p>We have learned more about how much we don\'t know about the complex geopolitics and economics around insulin than about how to directly address the policy dimensions of access to insulin and access to medicine in general. But the fact remains that our fundamental rationale for our work is economical, and has to do with the impact that decentralized production could have immediately and how it could change the landscape of incentives in the longer term to favor better policies.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>We hope our work will have several effects. First, by enabling more production of insulin by more groups, it can increase competition in the market for insulin, which is currently dominated by 3 large manufacturers who face\xa0criticisms of acting as an oligopoly and lawsuits credibly accusing them of illegally colluding to fix prices. Increased competition might quickly lower costs, bringing insulin into reach for more people, and decentralized production might avoid problems with supply chains reaching parts of the world where it\'s currently uneconomical to ship centrally-produced insulin. Second, in the longer term, reducing profits from sales of insulin could help to shift economic incentives towards developing better treatments, and ultimately a cure, for diabetes rather than the\xa0highly costly and inconvenient chronic treatment that those with diabetes must currently live with.

It is part of Woodbine, a hub for building autonomy in the wake of a dying civilization.</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Our goal is to examine what health autonomy would look like and how to begin to build it for ourselves here in New York city</strong>. We are beginning by providing ways to interact with neighbors, to think of health and care as a communal process, and becoming a point of aggregation where people can come together and share resources. We currently facilitate health related skill shares, create concrete ways to navigate the overwhelming health infrastructure that exists while lessening our dependence on it, in order to build an autonomous health community.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We are beginning to experiment with providing care outside of the realm of state control.</strong> This practice may involve working outside the structure of licenses, certifications and insurance. Our intention is always to heal, and so we are finding ways to do this that protects providers and patients.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Within Woodbine, the struggle for autonomy has been broken down into categories of the most urgent material necessity, meant to focus our attention on tangible goals toward building power within our community.</strong> Health autonomy is a crucial part of this. The health resource center is run by a mix of health professionals and those with informal training in various health practices. <strong>We want to re-create a sense of agency over health through a focus on the dissemination of usable, teachable skills.</strong> We are working with peers who practice herbal medicine, massage, feldenkrais, acupuncture, meditation, yoga and other forms of so called \u201calternative\u201d medicine. We are creating our own definition of wellness, one that is congruent with the realities of our time. There is also a large<strong> focus on prevention of illness, of re-fostering the idea of a healthy life, not merely the absence of disease.</strong> This is how we begin the necessary process of r<strong>emoving our physical and mental health from systems that would damage them furth</strong>er, to reclaim control over health and use it to increase our collective autonomy.</p>\n\n<p>We do not reject modern methods of medicine, but recognize the need to detach its knowledge from the oppressive institutions that guard it. <strong>We are attempting to change our orientation to institutions of western medicine to one of use over dependence</strong>; a manipulation of the systems that surround us. While there are significant problems with the city\u2019s public health infrastructure, they do provide much of the emergency and chronic care here. <strong>We realize that there needs to be support for people needing to navigate these without the fear of accruing a huge amount debt, alongside the emphasis of practices that will ultimately lessen dependence on them.</strong> The spaces dedicated to holistic medicine or alternative care are largely inaccessible to large portions of the population because they exist for those who can afford them. For these reasons, our center is meant to involve community members, help us understand the care-related skills we already have, and be an informational resource for accessing all types of health modalities. We have public open times for the community, staffed by one of our members, to assist in that process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Our skills workshops so far have included basic first aid, wound care, acupressure and intro to traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and an intro to medicinal plants.</strong> Coming up <strong>we will have workshops on navigating existing healthcare systems, nutrition, addiction and ongoing fitness skillshares</strong>. <strong>Our goal is that participants can use the resource library to learn about things relevant to their own health</strong>, potentially explore different modalities, and either receive aid in navigating the health systems in place or find treatment within the space itself.</p>\n\n<p>As we gain ground in the journey towards health autonomy, <strong>we see just how disempowered we have become when it comes to being able to give and receive the kind of care necessary. We have to fight that disconnection</strong> and build the infrastructure in order to give ourselves the space to envision a new existence. <strong>We look forward to hearing your stories, to understand your struggles and to collectively create the foundations to answer these monumental questions.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>\xa0Editor\'s note: We\xa0are building a\xa0collaborative bid for the MacArhur Foundation\'s 100 Million USD with our peers in 40 + countires.

But maybe also to all the kind of opposites and contrasts our society is so rich of.</p>\n\n<p>I am a doctor: I studied in Rome, where I observed the changement in a health system under my eyes. From a national health system capable of paying you even thermal therapy to one where if you need to see a specialist for a serious disease you can wait for months ...or just book an appointment for the next day if you can pay the private-practice fee.<br>I moved to Brussels for specialising in Pediatrics -(access to specialised training in different countries could be another interesting topic, but too many things to say for resuming everything in one post!)- and had the chance to work in different multicultural contexts: Brussels city-center, Antwerp travel clinic, Burundi\'s rural hospital. <br>What really caught my attention was how children health was related to some very specific cultural-related aspects. There are of course the well-known social determinants of health, but that\'s not all, or at least the way we deal with them as health worker is trivial.<br>Am I doing my job as a Pediatrician if I am not doing something for empowering mothers, for helping them in creating social networks, in having access to instruction, to healthy nutrition, safe shelter, gender equality? <br>I strongly believe Health is a social result and my job as a doctor will never be accomplished if I do not go out from hospitals, clinics, cabinets, if I do not act firstly as a citizen.</p>\n\n<p>Then let\'s have a look to the other face. I am a patient too, as anyone is at a certain moment in life -hopefully just a transient moment!-.<br>I was confronted to the weaknesses of Occidental medicine: when I see a specialist that only looks to my blood results and never to my eyes do I feel heal? He will probably solve my medical problem, but where is caring? Is that enough? Aren\'t we loosing something with this dichotomy? Sometimes, in spite of a very scientific vision of life, I prefer to look for alternative medicines as a patient, exactly because of this need for an holistic vision.</p>\n\n<p>I often think to the ancient hawaiian healing practice of Ho\u02bboponopono. The definition in the Hawaiian Dictionary is: "To put to rights; to put in order or shape, correct, revise, adjust, amend, (...); to make ready, as canoemen preparing to catch a wave." Illness is considered as a problem of the whole family (or even society), and the solution is then thought as a social practice too.<br>What could we learn from that?</p>\n\n<p>From a very practical point of view I am sure that a lot can be done, and thinking about how to create and empower social networks is one of the keys for improving health. <br>I think loneliness is one of the stronger social determinant of health in more and more industrialised societies: no solution can be thought without a systemic and partecipative vision. From what to start?</p>', u'post_id': 38430, u'user_id': 4061, u'timestamp': u'2017-10-17 12:00:27', u'title': u'Ho\u02bboponopono readapted: health and care as social interactions'}, {u'content': u'<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/2fe717cf7a06127670aefdc0253fec3a2ff07709" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2fe717cf7a06127670aefdc0253fec3a2ff07709.jpg" class="lightbox" title="2017-07-18 19.30.29.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/2fe717cf7a06127670aefdc0253fec3a2ff07709_1_690x517.jpg" width="690" height="517"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">2017-07-18 19.30.29.jpg</span><span class="informations">3280x2460 1.78 MB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Tweet-like description of the project</strong>:<br>Modules for voice display</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Need or problem you are attempting to solve</strong>:<br>Read numerical display with a voice, without having to use the sight.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Beneficiary, single person and/or community</strong>:<br>People with disabilities, like blind or people unable to read. <br>People with difficulties or impediment in reading a value on a display.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Solution, brief description of the project</strong><br>Voice module for electronic instruments and sensors, able to say numbers and short sentences.

Considering your project, please point out the project stages that you have already accomplished.</strong><br>The majority of electrical equipment currently available on the market consists of a visual output device, that communicates and interacts with the user through a visual display. Some devices, however, are also equipped with a voice interaction system, that allows users to utilize this technology without using their sight.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the totality of these electrical devices equipped with an alternative interface is very narrow and confined and is often regarding popular customary appliances, such as smartphones, domestic or medical scales.<br>In Italy, therefore, finding \u201cvoice instruments\u201d (as weather stations, domestic thermostats, washing machines or digital multimeters) is quite difficult, if not impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, while working in a chemistry lab, I thought about building a measuring instrument particularly useful in these contexts: a speaking pH-meter.</p>\n\n<p>The first prototype of this innovative instrument has been carried out through an analog pH sensor, an audio module WTV020, both controlled by an Arduino Uno board, the core of the device.</p>\n\n<p>The first version of the speaking pH-meter can pronounce sequentially the entire part, if necessary the word \u201ccomma\u201d and the decimal portion of pH value when the probe is immersed in a liquid.</p>\n\n<p>In the following versions, after carrying out some research, I thought about using a Mini DF Player as an audio module, rather than a WTV020 (more troubled and sophisticated to manage), while I decided to use an AtMega 328 as a control unit, streamlining the whole system.</p>\n\n<p>The key point of the subsequent developments was the possibility to use the pH-meter vocal system on other instruments, such as a barometer, an ammeter or even a dishwasher.<br>In order to meet these requirements it is necessary to know how to manage a huge amount of information and values, differently from the pH measurement, that ranges from 0 to 14.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve this it is necessary to subdivide the value or the information in the different parts that compose pronunciation, and subsequently manage microcontroller\u2019s routine in order to play audio tracks.</p>\n\n<p>The last step of the project consists of creating a case to contain all the electronic components. As for the small devices, in order to cut costs, I have decided to work with laser cutter machine, puncturing and customizing standard boxes, whenever possible. While, regarding particular devices, I have decided to cut and assemble the different sides of the case.</p>', u'post_id': 34145, u'user_id': 3775, u'timestamp': u'2017-08-08 13:12:26', u'title': u'MIR application - Voice Instruments'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hi folks!</p>\n\n<p>My name is Henry.

This is how I found out about OpenVillage festival. I caught fire on the spot and was instantly keen on coming. So I dropped Noemi a message and now it\'s happening <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>A few words on my background: </p>\n\n<p>I\'m born 1978 in Dresden, studied Math in Berlin, worked at a fairly large international company in the clinical research industry until I got super fed up by the top down management style and the general ethics in this field. I quit and then worked in Web Development and Graphics Design as a freelancer full time (I started this as a side project when I was studying) and helped developing the campaigning system of <a href="https://www.campact.de" rel="nofollow noopener">campact</a> - one of the larger German NGO\'s. </p>\n\n<p>After living abroad in Canada and Australia for a while I got on the natural building train, attended the <a href="http://earthship.com/academy" rel="nofollow noopener">Earthship Academy</a> in the States and after coming back to Berlin in 2013 founded the <a href="http://earthship-deutschland.de" rel="nofollow noopener">Earthship Deutschland Network</a> together with two fellow Earthship Lovers who I happened to meet in Berlin. After one year of networking and another winter down in Australia helping organizing natural building workshops with the <a href="http://agarifarm.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Agari Crew</a> I got involved with the build of the <a href="http://earthship-tempelhof.de" rel="nofollow noopener">first German Earthship</a> at the community <a href="http://schloss-tempelhof.de" rel="nofollow noopener">Schloss Tempelhof</a>. This is where the idea for the <a href="http://wirbauenzukunft.de" rel="nofollow noopener">Wir bauen Zukunft project</a> was born amongst participants of the quite amazing building workshop. That was end of 2015. Since I\'m heavily involved with the development of the Wir bauen Zukunft project. I still work as a freelance Web Developer and Graphics Designer to rake in the money. Further more I organize and run natural building workshops and seminars together with Lale Rohrbeck under the label <a href="http://down2earth.org" rel="nofollow noopener">down2earth</a>. We also teach at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/earthshipberlin" rel="nofollow noopener">Technical University Berlin</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My favourite topic is relationships. How do humans relate to each other? What is a healthy relationship? What role do dependencies play? From my perspective only through relating to other humans and/or to animals, plants, things we are able to evolve. To relate raises potential for growth in the form of challenge. We are challenged to overcome behavioral patterns through personal change, through lifting unconscious reactions to a conscious level in order make active decisions. Hence to relate is a means to be free. This - I think - is why building communities is so essential to move on from the century of self.</p>\n\n<p>On the festival I\'m happy to introduce the Wir bauen Zukunft project. A little rundown on the history of the project, where we at, why we are doing what we\'re doing and our vision. It would be a short presentation with Q&amp;A. Let me know if that resonates with you and fits into your program.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from that I would love to host a little workshop on how relationships foster our personal growth, employing the <a href="https://www.presencing.com/tools/case-clinics" rel="nofollow noopener">Case Clinic method</a> I learned during a <a href="https://www.presencing.com/ulab/overview" rel="nofollow noopener">U.Lab</a> Session two years ago. This will give the participants of the workshop the opportunity to learn about the Case Clinic format and about active listening apart from getting a better understanding of the nature of relationships. Let me know if that resonates with you.</p>\n\n<p>Looking forward to get to meet you all and to have a fantastic time at OpenVillage Festival <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>Much love<br>Henry</p>', u'post_id': 38174, u'user_id': 4095, u'timestamp': u'2017-10-12 16:50:18', u'title': u'Introduction and how I wanna contribute'}, {u'content': u'<p>The Festival program has been assembled in a participatory way, in a slow cooking mode. At its core are pillars of the OpenCare two year research on community alternatives to health and social care. Everywhere we look, from the hyperlocal to the international, people are committed to building solutions. There is a nascent, ambitious, and effective ecosystem of care that is developing in response to the failures of the current models.  We aim to highlight and support that development. </p>\n\n<p>The structure of the program brings together sessions built around three themes: Open Science, Architecture of Love, and Revolutionary Care. The themes blend and build on one another, reflective of the fundamental interdependence of care. Three fellows were selected from the variety of participants to help curate and develop the three themes as well as the festival itself.    </p>\n\n<p>One of OpenCare\u2019s core themes has been citizen science and Open Science. Many projects are producing highly promising products and outputs. "We have no capital, no investors, no shares" - Winnie Poncelet has lined up a number of both researchers and champions of affordable and accessible technology for care who are on a learning path to improve coordination and distribute team efforts and value accordingly.  </p>\n\n<p>Architectures of Love is evoking an important thematic tension between policy and values. Gehan Macleod condensed her question to an essential perspective, asking what foundational parts of a culture contribute to a caregiving society that go beyond formally enforced policies. Experiences from the City of Milano, from community groups in Galway and Glasgow are a few ways to understand what are enablers for citizen-led care responses. </p>\n\n<p>Revolutionary Care: Building Health Autonomy is the third theme of the festival.  As we talk about care, we are working to understand how we can live together and how we can develop our lives in commune. We ask the questions around responding to crisis, responding to our needs, and building generational models of care. Finally, as we face the destruction around us, we strive to highlight care as a fundamentally revolutionary act. The Woodbine Health Autonomy collective (represented by Nicole Demby and Frank Coughlin) based in New York City, has curated this theme. </p>\n\n<p>We know this festival will be more than another \u201cpassive\u201d conference.  The lines between presenter and audience are purposefully blurred and as we have worked to build the Edgeryders community, we will take the information and use it to build tangibly.  The first two days will highlight the work of different projects and groups around the world.  We look to meet new friends, share embraces with old ones, and learn together.  On the third day, we will experiment together as we continue in the process of building new worlds that place our collective well-being at the forefront. </p>\n\n<p>We look forward to walking this path with you.  </p>\n\n<p>Gehan, Noemi, Nicole, Frank, Winnie</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/742e15f9eeb5e5708177944b2c7e3869abf0c435" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/7/742e15f9eeb5e5708177944b2c7e3869abf0c435.jpg" class="lightbox" title="black.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/742e15f9eeb5e5708177944b2c7e3869abf0c435_1_690x98.jpg" width="690" height="98"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">black.jpg</span><span class="informations">1600x228 34.7 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div><br></p><table>\n\n<aside class="onebox googledocs">\n  <header class="source">\n    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13n7DYa8_9_n_qSlbkyZRZCJMsOXlq97DjErEf7zMcVk/edit?usp=drive_web" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">docs.google.com</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class="onebox-body">\n    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13n7DYa8_9_n_qSlbkyZRZCJMsOXlq97DjErEf7zMcVk/edit?usp=drive_web" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="googledocs-onebox-logo g-sheets-logo"></span></a>\n\n<h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13n7DYa8_9_n_qSlbkyZRZCJMsOXlq97DjErEf7zMcVk/edit?usp=drive_web" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">OpenVillage Official Program- Final</a></h3>\n\n<p>Program\n\n\n Day 1, Meet the OpenCarers\n The idea of care is paramount in our lives.

PMS seeks to understand the ways that our mental, physical, and social health is impacted by imbalances in and abuses of power. We can see that mobility, forced or otherwise, is an increasingly common aspect of life in the anthropocene. PMS is motivated to develop free tools of solidarity, resistance, and sabotage that respond to these conditions and are informed by a deep concern for planetary well-being. \xa0PMS is working together to forge an accountability model of health that can function multilocally and without requiring place-based fixity or institutional support.</p>\n\n<p>This accountability model for health - mental, physical, and social - will operate irrespective of place, and for all bodies seeking health care in assistance with all ailments and disempowerments. This tool would be informed by the integrated model of health implemented by the clinic at Bio.me in Thessaloniki and the mental health questionnaire developed by the Icarus Project in NYC, and other relevant tools we continue to encounter along the way. Inspired by the Bio.me system, our model functions as a\xa0triage system that helps participants understand the complete picture of a person\u2019s health first through a longform interview, followed by periodic \u2018check-ins\u2019 or urgent calls with the committed group. \xa0case \u2018health practitioners\u2019 are understood as those who share the responsibility of one another\u2019s health. This means that accountability works in all directions and that if we uphold certain procedures, everyone is capable of providing care. Following the initial long interview, a \u2018health card\u2019 is generated and shared among the team, which includes the care seeker. This serves as a health record that can be added to over time and that the care seeker can use in emergencies. Through long term support and awareness of individual and social patterns, the health care practitioners can connect health care seekers with local resources, provide consultation,\xa0and solidarity.</p>', u'post_id': 826, u'user_id': 3589, u'timestamp': u'2017-04-30 14:36:41', u'title': u'Power Makes Us Sick'}, {u'content': u'<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/1f6a636c96b00f0178b1e45b2ca46cc4dfa908ed" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1f6a636c96b00f0178b1e45b2ca46cc4dfa908ed.jpg" class="lightbox" title="A_Rey10.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/1f6a636c96b00f0178b1e45b2ca46cc4dfa908ed_1_690x388.jpg" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">A_Rey10.jpg</span><span class="informations">1200x675 144 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>For the session I will give a lecture of 40 min on making complex information accessible.

The fly fishing is also a way into learning about environment, physics, biology and your surroundings.</p>\n\n<p>The session can be supplemented with citizen science research on water quality, through biotic index (measuring water quality through the type and amount of living organisms in the water) or microbiotic activity (measuring the type and amount of micro-organisms).</p>\n\n<p>As the group will be diverse and there are multiple things to do, we\u2019ll work with a rotation, so that everyone gets to do a little of everything.</p>\n\n<p>The session should not be limited to the festival for its impact. It would be good if this format can be reused by other schools. Communicate about it with pictures, videos, etc. beforehand, during and after so that there is a lot of documentation: a mini website.</p>\n\n<p>What we still need for the session:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>People with fishing experience to teach casting techniques</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>People who want to facilitate the citizen science experiments</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Fishing rods and reels to borrow</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Help with online presence</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>An issue I experienced is finding opportunities to let people know that what we are doing. There will probably be others active in similar fields, so a session/workshop that creates a concrete output on this topic to take home would be nice!</p>', u'post_id': 6429, u'user_id': 3422, u'timestamp': u'2017-06-21 03:44:21', u'title': u'Session: Complexities of Water - Investigating Clean Water for Community'}, {u'content': u'<p><em>\u201cLocal authorities are no longer perceived as the only party expected to solve complex issues in cities\u201d (<a href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/55700321/livingstreetsnews1" rel="nofollow noopener">source</a>)</em></p>\n\n<p>This post follows a conversation between Pieter Deschamps (<a href="http://www.labvantroje.be/en" rel="nofollow noopener">www.labvantroje.be/en</a>) and <a class="mention" href="/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> and aims to provide ideas about effective urban mobilization and partnership building between cities and citizens.</p>\n\n<p>Living Streets is a project in Ghent, Belgium, where neighbors collaborate to temporarily redesign their streets for a couple of months, when neighborhood parking areas are marked down away from the street. You would see safe playgrounds built, or new green meeting spaces, or social, communal activities. A flagship project of the Trojan Lab non-profit, it went on for 4 years now, involving more than 25 streets, but as an experiment, it also had an expiration date: the end of 2017. An experiment as it was, its eyes were always on the prize: exploring a new approach of public space, finding alternatives for street parking and reworking people\u2019s relationship with city officials.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/51a2696a189975fad3fecd054d04ef13ce34cbf6" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/5/51a2696a189975fad3fecd054d04ef13ce34cbf6.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Ooievaarstraat_0.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/51a2696a189975fad3fecd054d04ef13ce34cbf6_1_666x500.jpg" width="666" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Ooievaarstraat_0.jpg</span><span class="informations">1280x960 1.55 MB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>The story begins with the city administration itself: in 2011 it was part of a <a href="http://www.themusicproject.eu" rel="nofollow noopener">European program</a>\xa0about the transition to a climate neutral city. The result was that we should rethink the mobility system in order to become climate neutral. Beginning of 2012, the city of Ghent started a transition arena. Pieter was one of the 20 people involved in this arena, as he used to work for the National Railway Company and involved in sustainable mobility development. These 20 people were brought together, and\xa0had the opportunity to be critical on the current system but also had the power of imagining a future vision, how it could be better.</p>\n\n<p>In this process, after six months, the arena developed a transition agenda for sustainable mobility in Ghent, where a couple of critical choices were identified,\xa0that needed to be made to achieve that vision. \u201cHard choices\u201d they called them: two of them were the basis for the Living Street project. So:</p>\n\n<p>1) The arena had the vision</p>\n\n<p>2)\xa0They determined some critical hard choices, policy making decisions</p>\n\n<p>3)\xa0At that point the arena had developed about 10 ideas for how this can be put in practice. Living Streets was one of these ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Pieter: \u201cAfter 6 months we pitched these ideas and while the city\u2019s work was done at the time, we didn\u2019t feel we were done. I will always remember that night. These 20 people sat in a bar and said \u201chow can we make our ideas real\u201d. That\u2019s how it all started.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The group didn\u2019t have a status at the time, they weren\u2019t the government neither a NGO. It was just a group of people that went on and organized in 2013 the first Living Streets in 2 streets. The city of Ghent helped by giving the permission to experiment with a new kind of street.</p>\n\n<p>Pieter: \u201cWe evaluated it with the city administration and wanted to carry on. We needed a legal status for two reasons: first, to be legally covered when things go wrong, and be able to protect ourselves and the project. A second is that we were starting to work with money, we had private sponsors and companies saying they were interested in what we are trying to discover. We organized an NGO, very close to the city organisation, because we wanted to change the system.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The mission of that NGO (The Trojan Lab) was - within the timeframe of 5 years, and importantly, in between 2 elections - organizing as many as possible experiments and gather lessons, see what dynamics all this can start. We\u2019ll stop before the elections to make sure that every political group has the possibility to take the lessons and translate them into the government system.</p>\n\n<h3>Where the project is today</h3>\n\n<p>The Living Street experiment has 3 strategic goals:</p>\n\n<p>1) How can we evolve from street park to neighborhood parking?</p>\n\n<p>2)\xa0How can we turn grey streets to more lively/colorful streets?</p>\n\n<p>3)\xa0If we create spaces on street level where people can meet each other and come together in a peaceful way, will this strengthen social cohesion in the neighborhood?</p>\n\n<p>Evaluation was in-built, it had to do with the process of arriving at a Living Street.</p>\n\n<p>Pieter: \u201cWe started engaging people with the question \u201cWhat if?\u201d; mapping the ideas and also the interests of people. \u201cHow do I look at my neighborhood?\u201d from the perspective of social security, traffic, safety, more green in the streets,... For each remark we mobilize our network and creativity to support initiators from each street to find solutions. After that process is done, the people come up with a vision for their living street, that will be implemented in practice. Evaluation is an ongoing process, so things can be changed during it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The project is driven by the communities in the city. The Trojan Lab started the mapping and year after year new people were interested to help and lead the process, or involve others. The quality check was always done by the organization.</p>\n\n<p>Pieter: \u201cIn terms of social cohesion, it\u2019s crystal clear after 51 Living Street-processes in Ghent, we created a new space at street level that improves relations between residents, between the city government and his residents and we discovered innovative solutions to redesign the street and park the car at a neighborhood parking.</p>\n\n<h3>What next?</h3>\n\n<p>The Trojan Lab and the volunteers from the Living streets are now helping the local government to think about and rethink how Living Streets would look like without the role of the Trojan Lab. What\u2019s in it for the city administration: it involves bringing different public stakeholders together with those who have participated from the streets, to think how it can continue in the upcoming years.

Matteo Matteini is part of the OpenCare team at the City of Milan bringing his background in urban sociology to the project. In my original theme proposal I\u2019d set out a hope to explore the role of policy within the context of a networked and complex world. What if policy isn\u2019t an effective tool to deliver a course of action any more? Before their involvement in OpenCare this might have been a suggestion that would have been supported by experience in Milan. In early 2015, the City of Milan passed a law requiring all commercial and public premises bordering the road to provide access to people with limited mobility or disabilities. Fifteen months later, only 10% of businesses had complied with the new regulations. However, I was curious to learn during a call with Matteo that this was not as simple as demonstrating the limited efficacy of policy. He went on to describe the processes that OpenCare project partners had used to help turn round that low compliance rate. </p>\n\n<p>It seems that by adopting a multi-stakeholder approach involving a range of partners from multiple perspectives along with facilitating processes that bring collective intelligence into play, that policies can be rendered effective tools that achieve the desired outcomes - in this case greater accessibility by those with mobility issues. For those who haven\u2019t yet caught Matteo\u2019s post on how we can implement policies through collaborative processes - you\u2019ll catch that <em>here</em>. Working with WeMake to co-design a process that would facilitate listening and cultivate relationships based on mutual understanding seems to have been key. <br></p><p><br><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5d626b706cf7fff51eae91b607e573077440f9b3.jpg" width="640" height="427"></p>\n\n<p> \n\n<br>\n\nOpen Rampette\u2019s strong partnership approach will be evident at the Open Village session as Matteo will be joined by Lucia Scopelliti, Head of Economic Planning at Comune di Milano and Costantino Bongiorno of FabLab WeMake. They will share diverse perspectives on the project and its successes.\n\n</p><p>One of the criteria for the successes now being achieved through Open Rampette seems to be process design and deliberate steps to include all stakeholders; those holding different roles within the public administration, at various levels of seniority as well as shopkeepers and business owners and of course members of the public with mobility issues impacted by the lack of access to shops and other facilities. A particular challenge seems to have been engaging all the \u2018actors\u2019 within the public administration - something that was only achieved through persistent engagement to form the necessary relationships. Shopkeepers were another distinct stakeholder group - when the project team started talking to them they found that by and large they were willing to comply with the regulation and make their shops accessible, but they couldn\u2019t afford technical expertise to implement a solution. This was another role that WeMake were able to fill. They helped facilitate a process of co-design to include all the stakeholders in finding technical solutions, including a means by which those with mobility issues could contact the shopkeepers to alert them to their arrival. <br></p><p><br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/293ad21bd83fddceac171af45fbd4b2220b328a9" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/2/293ad21bd83fddceac171af45fbd4b2220b328a9.JPG" class="lightbox" title="IMG_3226.JPG"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/293ad21bd83fddceac171af45fbd4b2220b328a9_1_690x459.JPG" width="690" height="459"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">IMG_3226.JPG</span><span class="informations">3665x2443 2.38 MB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div><br></p><p><br>Matteo also described the issues that can arise for lawmakers who devise regulations in isolation from those affected by the implications of implementation. In this case, the regulation created some complex protocols with which shopkeepers and businesses had to comply. This in itself was a barrier, quite apart from any other considerations such as cost, technical expertise and inconvenience. alessandro_contini agrees; \u201cIt\u2019s very common for bureaucratic procedures to be designed in a way that first off satisfies bureaucracy needs.\u201d Costantino and Alessandro have brought a social design to public policy as Costantino describes in his post as agile policymaking; \u201cSmall iterations, user research, interviews are few elements that guided our design process. While those concepts and tools are well accepted in the world of the industry..., in the domain of policymaking, regulations, and administration of city they haven\'t been quite discovered yet. We believe that some of the techniques we adopted can be translated in the exciting domain of the city regulatory system.\u201d<br></p><p><br>As a result of OpenCare, Matteo sees some lasting changes in the form of new approaches; \u201cOur mindset as an administration has changed due to OpenCare and its influencing how other departments work too. We are learning to deal with people differently through OpenCare.\u201d Partners from Milan will share their learning during a session on day 2 of Open Village. <br></p><p><br>Posts from the team are well worth a read:</p>\n\n<aside class="onebox whitelistedgeneric">\n  <header class="source">\n    <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/enforcing-a-policy-collectively/786" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">edgeryders.eu</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class="onebox-body">\n    <img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/5/58083ff648a85e43b50005639a3eec99cb030be0.jpg" width="108" height="61" class="thumbnail">\n\n<h3><a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/enforcing-a-policy-collectively/786" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Enforcing a policy "collectively"</a></h3>\n\n<p>Public places have to be accessible to all regardless their mobility capacity.

Envelopes will be delivered in 5 times in 5 different locations of the city. Every team will testify the accomplishment of the tasks through the use of a sport camera (GoPro) and their own mobile devices (we could use WhatsApp or Telegram to collect all the materials).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Duration and timing</strong><br> The experience will last for a total of 4 hours, divided as the following: Intro &gt; rules, team creation, tools test &gt; 30 minutes Game &gt; 5 envelopes in 5 different locations &gt; 2.30 hours (one envelope every 30 minute) Closing &gt; Chill out time, mission\u2019s review, prize moment, 45 minutes It must to be considered at least a 15 minutes delay gap.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Urban Route</strong><br> In order to fit the Open Village format, the game could start in the location of the Festival (the easiest way to have all the participants ready to go), and finish at a dinner location or a pub, where the player could have the opportunity to interact, share stories and chill out. The Open Village location could also be a great ending locations, players could leave their things there and play more freely, and we will then explore the surroundings of the area.<br>Usually checkpoint are located at 15 to 20 minutes walking distance and connected with path that could cross public spaces, parks or pedestrian areas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Name</strong><br>Incognito Battleclash is not exactly in line with the goal that we want to reach, so maybe could be cool to come up with a different name? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Tasks</strong> <br>The tasks design will be based on the Open Village contents in order to achieve a tasks-list of 25 missions, divided between the 5 envelopes and organized in a crescendo.<br>Health, citizen science, care, body fitness will be mixed with funny and interactive tasks, to involve also passer-by and citizens.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Output</strong><br>We will have a massive amount of video/pictures and other player generated materials that could be helpful to describe and share the topics of the Festivals.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>BIG OPEN QUESTION</strong><br>The tasks/creative missions are the core of the game, and could lead the experience in one or in the other direction (simple fun vs serious game).</p>\n\n<p>Then probably the best way to understand that is starting throwing ideas about the tasks lists and see how far or how close we are from the Festival topics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>OPEN QUESTION</strong><br>Incognito Battleclash is an already tested format (we did it in Roma few month ago with 50 people), but we can also imagine something more complex (single urban games in the different Checkpoints?).</p>', u'post_id': 33985, u'user_id': 347, u'timestamp': u'2017-08-04 16:48:12', u'title': u'Urban Game @OpenVillage Festival'}, {u'content': u'<p>I\u2019m a designer, nurse, yoga teacher, food grower and performer, currently studying Business Enterprise and Community Development with <a href="http://equalireland.ie/" rel="nofollow noopener">Equal Ireland</a>.

I have been employed in the non profit sector as a Project Manager on various projects, after having explored and tested theatrical/drama techniques and incorporating that into Science Communication and Health Messaging. And let me tell you, I am completely motivated and inspired by this community and others toward this goal and Public Engagement.</p>\n\n<p>My experience as a process facilitator includes various participatory methods including: photovoice, drama, collaborative/participatory video, workshop design and events design. I\'ve resigned from my formal job in order to test additional methods which I believe have the power to stimulate dialogue, forge relationships across difference sectors and reach larger audiences in organic, fun and interactive means.</p>\n\n<p>Since resigning from my formal employment, I\'ve begun developing concepts using Street Arts and collaborations to install live arts installations driven toward Public Engagement. Now, Public Engagement as a term itself is not void of ambiguity and misuse for the purpose of funding or green-stamping our professional works. This isn\'t anyone\'s fault as it\'s a field that is developing. We should strive for full participation in our works, not merely using the term as a stamp of approval. My project aims to forge relationships with very different bodies of knowledge and social status, i.e. biomedical professionals/scientists, community members and artists, all of whom I argue have equally important and necessary knowledge to combat illness, increase the status of general Public Health and, simply put, fight a battle using a full arsenal of knowledge and weapons.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a08f727e3497eb6eef69eb85a97aeaf3b2e694cc.jpg" width="500" height="500"></p>\n\n<p>Allow me to rewind, ever so slightly to paint a picture. I\'ve previously sought to test photovoice as a participatory method by forging relationships with community members from an under-resourced community in Cape Town, South Africa, and Scientists from the University of the Western Cape. The project sought to bring these varied parties together in a participatory workshop process, after which community members were trained on DSLR cameras and instructed to capture the lived experience of food in their everyday lives. They could capture anything related but not limited to\xa0the purchase, consumption or disposal of food. This project revolved around Cardiovascular disease and the Scientists involved were Seniors at the Cardiovascular Research Unit at the University of Stellenbosch. The array of visual material and accompanying narrative was phenomenal and utterly beautiful. It shed light on the constant negotiation of food and consumption in these communities, including the availability of food, what kind of food was deemed healthy or not, when it was suitable for food to be disposed, food as celebration and community building etc. To me, and the Scientists involved, this process unveiled knowledge on food consumption behaviour and more structural issues imposed on these communities. It was never simply a "<em>I want KFC and I shall buy KFC"</em>. This food choice is always compounded by budget, compromise, available options, time of the month, etc. People are consciously and constantly negotiating and re-negotiating choices. My heart broke when a Senior member of the project sample pulled me aside mid-project and told me ...</p>\n\n<p><em>"Nabeel, I\'ve suffered from Type 2 Diabetes for 15 years. At least thats what the doctors told me. They gave me medication and send me away each month. But never before has anyone told me what Diabetes is in a way that I understand. Never before have they taken time to talk with me. But now I have these scientists in my backyard. And they can\'t leave until I know my body</em>"...</p>\n\n<p>It\'s necessary to point out that even though this community has an approximate population of 100 000 it only has one superstore that either of us would immediately turn our back on. Most food products are sourced from small kiosks on the corners. Yes, I am still in shock. How and why are the most vulnerable excluded from knowledge and provision of services? An alarm bell rang in my head that I could not ignore since I resigned. We\'ve been running projects with a very specific agenda which more often than not in the non-profit sector provides an income and life for the administering organization. The sad truth is peoples knowledge are not given the kudos and respect it desperately needs. And in this battle, that may just be our most prize weapon.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Fastforward 8 months and I\'ve developed a concept which: 1. aims to bring 3 very different bodies of knowledge together in a participatory,\xa0collaborative and egalitarian process; 2. forge relationships between these traditionally-deemed exclusive fields, i.e. arts and science and; 3. test organic and participatory processes to create events and arts installations that extends this knowlege to a broader audience in a fun interactive means.</p>\n\n<p>Now. Back to my current project...\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I have recently collaborated with the University of Cape Town\'s Swallowing the World project which is a curatorial project focused on the lived experience of TB. My team of graffiti artists and I joined the festival, set up 2.5 x 2.5m canvas in the middle of campus and contributed to this project on International TB Day. As the focus of the fest was on Destigmatization, we followed suit and allowed interaction between the audience and ourselves to influence or define the artpiece. A\xa0short video of our work:</p>\n\n<p><div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="2NCOAeipD9k" data-youtube-title="Swallowing The World" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>\xa0</p>\n\n<p>This project will be installed in South Africa, India and Botswana simultaneously and attempts to use culturally- and community-sensitve street art forms. As such, we are holding participatory principles as central to the success of the project as we would like to design the project trajectory, outcomes and art installations/events with all participants. You may be thinking that no Funder finds this ideal. Alas, we\'re all wrong. We have had alot of interaction with a potential funder who chose to view the testing phase on UCT in livetime. This live time viewing feature of our project is something we would want to function very much like Edgeryders as it allows for collaborations and creativity between individuals and entities that may not traditionally interact.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>This leaves me at your feet as I\'d love feedback, interaction and potentially consider collaborations with not only this project but others moving forward. I\'d love to work in varying contexts and establish relationships between and across scientists, community members and artists from varying countries. This will be my next step. Apart from the actual arts installations and events, as products, we will be developing a best practices publication focused on the entire project in each 3 countries. I will also carry my "researcher" hat for the duration of this project as I wish to study: the interaction;\xa0immediate knowledge transfer between scientists, community members and artists; retained knowledge and overall impact. I would openly accept any suggestions or feedback...\xa0</p>\n\n<p>For now I continue on my mission to test community- sensitive and -relevant means of expression and trying to find ways of using those tried and tested methods as communication tools. After all, what we want are healthier , expressive and inclusive communities whether you choose to define that territorially or otherwise. Only together can we progress...\xa0</p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e59a54de7bdd19268daef9c923e9cb1e81d15408.jpg" width="322" height="500"></p>', u'post_id': 33730, u'user_id': 3311, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-05 16:15:08', u'title': u'Exploring Street Arts and egalitarian collaborations between Scientists, Communities & Artists as Public Engagement and Science Communication mechanisms/tools'}, {u'content': u"<p>This exercise is an opportunity to reflect on what you skills would like to develop in the course of building a product or service with others.

What were your motivations?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Hubotics project started in late 2013. At that point I was about to finish my Master\u2019s studies and I wanted to add a practical side to my technical skills as an engineer and as a passionate DIYer by developing accessible technologies and aids which could have helped improving independence for people suffering from motor disabilities. Actually, the reason why I decided to study engineering and became a builder and hacker stemmed from my personal experience with my sister Chiara, who suffers from a motor disability.</p>\n\n<p>I remember, as a child, my parents used to buy plenty of super expensive devices, as computer headsets, mice, keyboards or having to travel back and forth between clinics and private medical studios to have access to the \u201clatest\u201d rehabilitation techniques. After having hacked wheelchairs, remote controls for doors and televisions inside our house and having realized several other robotic contraptions, I realized that achievement of independence through the use of one\u2019s own body is one of the most gratifying experiences everyone could hope for, that\u2019s how the idea of creating an exoskeleton to be used in everyday\u2019s life was born.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Did you start alone? How long did it take to develop the initial prototype? How was it funded?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Around that time, I started speaking about these ideas with Roberto, a friend with whom I had studied between Torino and Milano. Together, we started brainstorming and discussing and we finally converged on the idea of developing a low-cost, 3D printed exoskeleton for rehabilitation and assistance of upper-limbs, directly at people\u2019s homes.</p>\n\n<p>The idea was proposed at the Telecom Italia WCAP accelerator in Catania that believed in the project and decided to fund us. This allowed us to buy the 3D printers and the components to build and iterate on our ideas and prototypes. The first reliable prototype of the device, finalized in one year, consisted of a wearable, smartphone-controlled, elbow exoskeleton.</p>\n\n<p>After showing the device at the MakerFaire 2015 in Rome and gathering plenty of positive feedback, we understood that the project had plenty of potential and decided to keep working on it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is your current status now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Today, together with Roberto and Chiara, we keep on improving our devices and iterate on the designs in order to achieve a concept as usable and useful as possible while maximizing customizability and accessibility. Our latest device consists of an exoskeleton with 3 active degrees of freedom for controlling the shoulder abduction/adduction, shoulder flexion/extension and elbow flexion/extension of its wearer.</p>\n\n<p>The device can be controlled by means of a smartphone app or by a program with predefined motions/tasks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. How do you see it moving forward? What kind of help/expertise/data that is missing for moving to a next phase?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our main objective in the near future is running experiments with potential users of the exoskeleton and their relatives, in order to gather further feedback and improve our devices based on this.</p>\n\n<p>\xa0Additionally, we are brainstorming on possible models that would allow the project to keep its philosophy of openness and accessibility while making it economically sustainable. For example, how to fund the project in order to promote further development? How to enable open/low-cost and customizable solutions capable of reaching end-users? How to ensure that these devices would work (and keep working) at users\u2019 houses (services?), all these are open questions that we will be working on for the next phase.</p>', u'post_id': 806, u'user_id': 3069, u'timestamp': u'2017-01-06 09:27:53', u'title': u'The story of Hubotics -- A DIY physiotherapy kit'}, {u'content': u'<p>I met Sigried some years ago when I was working on a Parc project in Brussels and we had long discussions about the way she looks at the balance between public and private space. Between then and now she experimented around public \u2013 private space in Istambul, the Netherlands, Brussels and chose to practice her philosophy with her boyfriend, a product designer by living small (<a href="http://us12.campaign-archive2.com/?u=052ead8788cf3b1aea33b9d84&amp;id=abb57f6591&amp;e=0e34db7b1d" rel="nofollow noopener">We\xa0Live\xa0Small\xa0</a>is an on-going experiment developing tools to make living in\xa0small space possible.)</p>\n\n<p>When we meet again she comes back from a week working in her apartment and starts explaining why they chose to live small. For her living in a condensed space within the city is ideal if you design it well. In Belgium people have the reflex to buy fast, and you feel a societal pressure around it. Because buying in the city become impossible, people find big houses farther away from the city. But big houses means a lot of possessions, and it means working harder in desk jobs in the city, which means again more stress. So the logical decision to stop this infernal spiral for them was to choose to live small, really small, and use the exterior as complementary.</p>\n\n<p>The secret of living decently in the city is to manage space and time differently, but she is aware that it becomes more difficult. Public space isn\u2019t anymore a space for everybody, but a space for nobody. A cleaned-out space that only looks pretty. Because our fascination for more <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;utm_content=feature&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook" rel="nofollow noopener">sterile environments</a> we lost the skills to interact with each other. Who needs to interact with your neighbour if you have all the space you need inside your private home. Living small could bring back the necessity of interaction and borrowing stuff from your neighbours, helping create a much-needed social fabric to your neighbourhood.</p>\n\n<p>When she works for the semi-public private space project <a href="http://www.huis-vdh.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Huis VDH</a> she finds the same logic. Creating common spaces that gives the feeling of a home, but are able to invite people over to use it in certain ways. Why have a big living room with kitchen for social events that you organize four times a year at home when you could share such space with other people. Some things can be privatized but not everything. In the same line of thought she sees empty spaces above shops or pubs and restaurants as an opportunity to create common spaces for people living small. You could think: why not set bigger apartments above those places? That could immediately make it difficult for the bar or restaurant holder to continue his night live activities, and also this plays an important role in the city.</p>\n\n<p>\u2018But how could it directly be linked with care?\u2019, i asked her. She takes the example of elderly care, also discussed in the interview with <a href="/t/little-side-note-what-is-the-role-of-the-government-in-this-bottom-up-open-care-project/693">Ginette</a> where people even if they live in big houses don\u2019t have the time anymore to care for their elderly and put them into homes, from own experience we conclude that the home isn\u2019t the best designed space to give good care. Making effort to create a nice environment for the elder people could help them feel well longer. We know from studies that interaction is a key in stopping <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/175303708X390464" rel="nofollow noopener">elderly dementia</a>. So having public spaces designed around giving care and sharing part of your lives with unknown people could be a major incentive for our future problems with ageing population.</p>\n\n<p>When living in Istanbul it occurred to her that people interacted much more easily with each other in the street, even complete strangers could discuss with each other when waiting for the bus. She doesn\u2019t know exactly why it occurred much more often in Istambul then in Brussels but she had the feeling the way we use time was part of the solution. Living small gives you much more time to just sit around, be outside and make you car independent. Only this simple part, of not having a car makes you much more able to interact with the people you see. But don\u2019t be alarmed; this discussion didn\u2019t became a \u2018everything was better in the past\u2019 discussion.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://cascoland.com/#/" rel="nofollow noopener">Cascoland</a> was another project where she worked around public and private space. One of the tasks she had was to implement a sharing community inside a mixed neighbourhood. Like in Germany or Suisse they printed out little signs of objects anybody could put on their door to show they can lent this out. What was interesting was the conclusion: when explaining the concept to people with only Dutch roots they answered almost all the time: but I have nothing to share. For them it was a difficult step to share something of their belongings with their neighbours. When explaining the concept to people with Arab roots for example they didn\u2019t have a problem with sharing and where found of the idea, but had a problem with the fact the stickers would become an opportunity for other people to come inside.

My hats: I am a research associate at the Extreme Citizen Science research group with Prof Muki Haklay at University College London. Here I develop and promote techniques for public engagement in Do-It-Yourself science and technology. My research focuses on the taken-for-granted process of inquiry that underlie all exploration and discovery and which represent ownership over learning and action: figuring things out by oneself, experimenting, seeking knowledge, and questioning the state of things to find potential solutions to local concerns. I have also developed frameworks for the understanding of factors influencing our engagement in inquiry and initiative-taking at the personal, organisational, and societal levels. I am also a London-based community organiser for the <a href="https://publiclab.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science</a>, a not-for-profit organisation and community that creates accessible, low-cost civically engaged monitoring methods. As community organiser I work with communities, researchers, and stewards on the use and development of DIY tools for environmental monitoring. I am also co-founder of Citizens without Borders, a London-based group dedicated to creating spaces for exchange that build the public\u2019s capacity to act as civic agents. I am founder of  \'<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Science-has-no-Borders/" rel="nofollow noopener">Science has no Borders</a>\', an initiative through our project TogetherScience.eu, which is committed to science that benefits from community and aims at creating an environment for networked engagement to learn, connect, and gain feedback on ideas, prototypes, and projects. Together with my team at UCL we  lead on the Horizon 2020 EU project, "Doing It Together Science" - TogetherScience.eu, which aims to bridge the gap between civic agency in science/technology and policy. In this project I focus on consortium management, development of public engagement activities in Biodesign and Environmental Sustainability, the formative evaluation of the project, and the capacity building, self-care, and well-being of science event facilitators and \'DIY science educators\'. For the latter, we are creating online resources on shared good practice, gaining meaningful feedback, engagement, outreach, science communication, and inclusion techniques.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ll be participating in the <strong>Infrastructures for Autonomy panel</strong> discussing sustainability of initiatives and organiser\'s self-care.

Meanwhile, last month Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a bill for universal, single-payer health insurance that has drawn unprecedented levels of support from a broad coalition of democrats. </p>\n\n<p>There are those enduring acute crises\u2014citizens of Puerto Rico facing an immediate future without electricity and clean water, those suddenly robbed of a loved one in Las Vegas\u2014but for many, life toggles between the perpetual reminders of how bad things are on the news and some more mundane reality.  Even for those for whom the everyday is an enduring state of crisis\u2014the undocumented mother, the uninsured person with a grave illness, the opioid addict, the trans person living in the wrong city\u2014life takes on its daily, unspectacular rhythms, settles into its stabilities. </p>\n\n<p>There is a lot of doomsday sentiment floating around these days that transcends class and political affiliation.  A devout state policeman who engaged us in conversation when our car ran out of gas on a Virginia freeway said standing by as white nationalists clashed with Antifa in Charlottesville bolstered his belief that the prophecies of Revelations were underway.  Silicon Valley billionaires are designing their post-apocalyptic contingency plans.  The \u201cprepper\u201d industry is thriving.  But, while some live in immediate anticipation of societal collapse, Sanders\u2019 bill reminds us that there is also the capacity for major reform.  The barrage of monster storms and renewed nuclear brinksmanship under the reign of a \u201c<a href="https://twitter.com/jaboukie/status/911650241832656896">sentient bathroom swastika with the personality of a yeast infection</a>\u201d has snapped even the complacent into some new level of alertness, yet for many, fear and discontent organizes itself around to the liberal horizon of the 2020 presidential elections. </p>\n\n<p>Like others on the radical left, we at Woodbine probably fall closer to the doomsday camp.  Yet, as we take pains to build and broaden our vision, we should imagine not only some Murphy\u2019s Law future of hegemonic fascism or imminent disintegration, but also what the best-case scenarios might be within the present system.  Doing so will help us better delineate the strategic nature of our struggle, and to better articulate the imperative for a truly alternative future.  We should ask ourselves the question: is there a difference between futures that some of us could live with and a universally livable future?     </p>\n\n<p>Armchair radicals are quick to distance themselves from anything that smells of the dreaded <em>reform</em>, rather than <em>revolution</em>.  Yet, that these radicals tend to be single, white men with limited care duties should make us skeptical of snide, wholesale dismissals.  Expanded state welfare is a good thing.  Yet it is also far from the be all end all of our struggle.  In order to understand why, it helps to turn to the devastating critiques leveled by those who have always been systematically abjected from capitalist society in all its iterations, such as Afropessimists who know that Blackness is what is structurally negated, or Marxist feminists who understand that capitalism will always relegate aspects of care or social reproduction to the realm of the unwaged or onto the shoulders of the most marginalized.  Likewise, health is not simply denied by any one lobby or administration; it is what is negated by capitalist society.  This negation may not be a structural condition in the same way as the extermination of blackness and the subordination of women; in industrial society, capitalism had to take ensure the body of the worker had enough of what it needed to keep returning daily to work.  Within late capitalism, it is the body of the consumer that must be maintained (or the body of the potential angry horde that must be assuaged).  Yet the negation of health has always been one of capitalism\u2019s de facto effects.  The body it preserves is one robbed from us and remade in all its parts according to the profit motive, one pumped full of industrial poisons, one fashioned according to a productive, compliant, white heterocissexist ideal.  </p>\n\n<p>We can\u2019t let the embattling of our rights defensively delimit our terms.  Take, for instance, the relentless attack on reproductive rights currently underway in this country.  This week, the Trump administration put forth rules that would expand the rights of employers to deny women coverage for birth control.  But should we simply fight to restore the universal coverage mandate for contraceptives under Obama?  If we want women to truly have control over their bodies, we must acknowledge that hormonal birth control\u2014designed to suppress naturally-occurring androgens and so to reduce body hair and acne, often given to teenagers without their full understanding of its effects\u2014is part of a regime that regulates gender and functions within a provider-consumer model of care that robs people of agency over their bodies (as <a href="https://www.academia.edu/24586798/Pills_genders_and_design_Speculations_on_Queer_Materialities">Luiza Prado de O. Martins</a> explains, these \u201csexopolitical\u201d medications can also be \u201c(mis)used to articulate new ways of doing gender,\u201d but these ways deviate from the medicalized norm).  We need to do more than argue for the restoration or the expansion of a system that has enabled liberation for some (with liberation being the freedom to join the workforce), while cruelly oppressing others\u2014think of the eugenicist policies U.S. institutions have carried out against Native, Latin, and Black Americans.      </p>\n\n<p>In August, my gig as a graduate student will be up and I will lose my health insurance.

He\u2019s been at events and workshops I\u2019ve attended, \u2026 and he\u2019s usually engaged in issues I\u2019d not yet thought about too much. One of the last times I\u2019d spoken to him he was organising around precarious workers issues. The next I came across Michael was through Edgeryders. His <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/mobile-independent-clinic/827">post</a> raised some thought provoking points - what might be gained by seeing the migrant crisis as a training ground for other crisis? We met for a chat at a cafe so I could write up this intro and it was the first real opportunity I\u2019d had to find out a bit more about Michael\u2019s background.</p>\n\n<p>So I asked him how he came to get involved in migrant solidarity and the other issues I knew he\'d worked on. Michael was studying economics at university when he first got involved in environment justice campaigns. He started to see the way in which many of these issues linked up at a structural level. The budgets to fund nuclear submarines and missiles such as those based just outside Glasgow could be diverted to tackle necessary climate measures.</p>\n\n<p>Michael was involved in founding Plane Stupid Scotland - a campaign airport extension as the fastest growing cause of climate change. While there were successes that came from the campaign; the targeted airport expansions didn\u2019t go ahead - the campaign didn\u2019t achieve the growth of a movement that it had hoped might come about. Towards the end of the campaign people were left pretty exhausted - that topic of burnout that seems a pretty familiar theme on the Edgeryders platform. Michael experienced these tough times when you had to rest up from exhaustion as not all bad but as an opportunity to reflect, to learn and adapt. His resilience is rooted in gratitude even when things are hard going.</p>\n\n<p>From there Michael got involved in the Climate camps; Heathrow, Kent, Blackheath, Edinburgh and Mains Hill at the tail end of the anti-globalisation movements. The camps involved a lot of collective learning and opportunities to do things on a bigger scale. They were places to get exposed to new ideas and feel connected to other people in throughout the UK &amp; EU. Michael understands their importance more as being a means to give people a taste of large scale communal protest experiences. He acknowledges they had less impact on climate issues but sees the camps as an empowerment process that fed in to other ventures and movements. </p>\n\n<p>Then he saw the wave of hope and optimism that was Copenhagen 2009 rise and fall. His memories of the experience were pretty bleak. This confirmed a change of direction that was away from protest politics towards more direct means to deliver change. He deliberately sought out issues that he\'d researched as likely to become increasingly problematic in future years. </p>\n\n<p>These two factors led him in to migrant solidarity. He got involved with the Unity Centre in Glasgow. This involved lots on legal case work, anti-deportation, and people in detention and housing rights. There Michael helped out with Unity\'s newly formed charity, which distributed clothes and other necessary items to those in need and with founding the Unity Cafe - a soup kitchen and food bank. Michael was involved with helping to house migrants before there were any night shelters in Glasgow. It was another period where he saw too few people doing too much. But he has warm memories - describing times when there were always people round for dinner. When they got by \'on their wits\u2019 by \u2018skipping\' for food (rescuing food waste from the dump) and the sense of companionship and agency that came from finding a way to solve problems as they arose, finding another plate of food or another bed on the floor - at a time before these kind of actions became more popular. </p>\n\n<p>A logical progression from this work came in the form of the <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/mobile-independent-clinic/827">Golden Trailer</a>. A few friends watched Storming Sarajevo - and hatched an idea. It took two years between idea and implementation. They put useful skills like engineering, mechanics, nursing together with an abandoned trailer they\u2019d come across. They kitted the trailer out to offer basic medical aid, music, respite and a cinema to migrants in Italy and Serbia. You can read more about this on Michael\u2019s post here [link]. Some of the challenges were staying motivated while the idea got off the ground and started to take shape and pulling in untied funding. Funding that wasn\u2019t conditional enabled the trailer to respond to needs as they came across them - they weren\u2019t tied to a specific place and they could identify areas where other aid wasn\u2019t getting through and target these. </p>\n\n<p>The experiences Michael had with the trailer were an opportunity to observe events first hand but he told me he\'d started researching related issues prior to setting off. His research covered areas such as disaster sociology which suggests there is no such thing as a \'natural disaster\u2019 - rather there are always social factors that contribute to crisis. Other themes that drew Michael\'s interest included the influence that crisis can have on people\u2019s behaviours and responses - the well known tendency for people to take responsibility and demonstrate more solidarity during disasters. How could this tendency be cultivated beyond times of catastrophe? </p>\n\n<p>These are the kind of topics Michael hopes to explore as part of the <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/emergency-mutual-aid/6437">Emergency Mutual Aid</a> session on Day 2 of the Open Village. What are the barriers to this form of direct response and how do we overcome these? How might we turn hard-won personal experience in to collective expertise to up-scale a collective response? He has some ideas and has started to develop some resources; podcasts and zines and he\u2019s keen to create space for collaboration with  others with similar experiences to explore what else can be done.</p>', u'post_id': 35132, u'user_id': 3613, u'timestamp': u'2017-08-31 08:54:08', u'title': u'Michael Dunn: Emergency Mutual Aid session host'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hello soon-to-be festival friends! First off, I want to express gratitude to all who have put in so much care/labor to make this convening happen. Due to some bouts with illness amidst relocation to Europe, I am a bit late to the game. Our comrades from Woodbine invited me to contribute ideas a while back and I am just now getting to this as the official program has been decided. I would like to introduce myself still in case this helps facilitate a coming together with those with like concerns, possibly in the freestyle sessions (or even more informally after meals and the like).</p>\n\n<p>As a curator, citizen, human, I\u2019ve focused my attention primarily on the interrelatedness of groups, subjects, and objects within various social and political systems and, particularly, institutional bodies. Last year I realized that I was at a crucial point where focused time outside of the imperatives and logics of an institution could facilitate a necessary perspectival shift in the work I was doing, one that would inevitably alter the way I\u2019ve been working though the convergence of contingency, labor, administration and planning within organizational bodies in the arts. Just as I slowed down, I got sick. This is how the ongoing curatorial project \u201cSick Time, Sleepy Time, Crip Time: Against Capitalism\u2019s Temporal Bullying\u201d began, out of this lived experience. (Note: \u201cCrip\u201d is a political reclaiming of the derogatory label cripple.)</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSick Time\u201d argues that care for the body in states of debility and disability (particularly their temporalities) can help us to re-imagine the ground necessary for collectivity. It proposes that better incorporation of the temporal states of rest, illness, sleep, and aging into society works against the Eurocentric conception of progressivist linear time that finds its corollary in neoliberal capitalist logics and drains humans of their life blood. Dragging on, circling back, with no regard for the stricture of the work week or compulsory ablebodiness, sick time is non-compliant. It refuses a fantasy of normalcy measured by either-in-or-out thresholds and demands care that exceeds that which the nuclear family unit can provide.  (A set of curatorial notes/manifesto can be found <a href="http://temporaryartreview.com/notes-for-sick-time-sleepy-time-crip-time-against-capitalisms-temporal-bullying-in-conversation-with-the-canaries/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> and more info about the first exhibition in the series can be found in the PR <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/537c9eb6e4b0ca838c2f4f52/t/58e3bc521e5b6c8ff92d36a1/1491319891111/Sick+Time+PR+Draft_3_30.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d hoped to offer a bodily communication workshop centered around how we communicate about illness, but perhaps some of the artist\u2019s practices/experiments in this show might be interesting to discuss. Much of the work being done by the artists and communities of care in \u201cSick Time\u201d relates to a distinction articulated by Stefano Harney and Fred Moten in their 2013 book between policy vs planning. In short, policy comes from above and pronounces others as incorrect, while planning invents the means [of social reproduction] in a common experiment. \u201cPlanning in the undercommons is not an activity, not fishing or dancing or teaching or loving, but the ceaseless experiment with the futurial presence of the forms of life that make such activities possible. Planning is rooted in a black radicalism, which hopes against hope...in order to survive in the deplorable present" As Harney and Moten further detail, \u201cManagement looses not in workplace but economic management can not win in realm of social reproduction...here, management encounters forms of what we will call planning. In the undercommons of the social reproductive realm the means, which is to say the planners, are still part of the plan."</p>\n\n<p>One example to look at might be the Canaries. Canaries is a support group and art collective for people with autoimmune diseases that operate on crip time amidst a scarcity of language to address rapidly unfolding chronic illnesses. For the publication project, <em>Notes for the Waiting Room</em> they contributed texts and images addressing the question: \u201cHow do you take care of yourself during a flare-up of your symptoms?\u201d The resulting publication, distributed in art contexts as well as in doctor\u2019s waiting rooms, challenges the unilateral and hierarchical transmission of information from doctor to patient and, much like the overall art and advocacy work of Canaries, fosters solidarity and embodied knowledge sharing instead. Or another example is the work Cassie Thornton has done. She has investigated the impact of economic systems on public affect and behavior for some time and, like Canaries, is currently exploring methods of social healthcare by testing a model for de-financialized care that responds to the experience of crisis. </p>\n\n<p>By constituting new cultural rituals and creating provisional non-hierarchical infrastructures, these artist\u2019s works question the very borders of a body and provide myriad radical possibilities for gaining agency and negotiation with the problems of the body by using a political relational model that views dependency with others positively. While the space of the arts has long been a site for new modes of self representation, critique, cross-disciplinary experimentation, the envisioning of alternatives, and challenging the dominance of mind-centered epistemologies that dislodge us from our bodies, it could be interesting to discuss how it allows for a reconfiguration of structures of care that then does or does not trickle out. Of course there is a certain experimentation of forms that is germane to the arts, but there is also the way arts critiques just helps institutions optimize under neoliberalism etc to consider\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Looking forward to discussing this and more!</p>', u'post_id': 37342, u'user_id': 4078, u'timestamp': u'2017-10-02 16:13:53', u'title': u'Introduction: Planning versus Policy--Provisional Architectures for Care and Somatic Healing in the Arts'}, {u'content': u'<p>My name Aymen Masmoudi, I\u2019m 30 years old, and since I was a child I have been loving and following technology and everything related to it.</p>\n\n<p>In 2006, I obtained my Baccalaureate Diploma in Mathematics, and then I have decided to get into the virtual world and have started learning by myself through the web.</p>\n\n<p>I have been trying to learn many things including design, videos mounting, net security, and development.

Or if it is my association with a more type A personality, always striving to be efficient, productive, serious?  Or if it is a reflection of the world that surrounds us?  I feel like an old time blues singer, asking \u201cwhy do I always have to sing the blues\u201d.  Perhaps this is a roundabout way of asking for patience with my oftentimes apocalyptic tomes. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m here in the US, sitting in a cafe in NYC, watching the daily commute of walkers and bikers.  It\u2019s a beautiful fall day, one of those days that reminds you of all the joys of the summer, giving you that last bit of warmth, but with the tiniest bite of cold in the evening that tells your body to get ready for the hibernation.  Those days that make you feel happy to just let the sun wash over your face, warm but not hot, comforting but not overwhelming.  The day holds a sense of happiness and hope.  But for many in the US, this past month has shown clearly that while we may relish in the joy of what has passed, winter truly is coming.  </p>\n\n<p>Our month started off with the terrorist attack in Charlottesville, Virginia.  For those not aware, a secret white supremacist rally was held on a Friday night at the campus of UVA.  It was filled with hundreds of angry white men, complete with tiki torches (yes really) and chats of \u201cblood and soil\u201d, a key slogan for the Nazi regimen.  Counter protestors were brutally attacked and the police were nowhere to be seen.  The next day, a large gathering of white supremacists went to a central park for a sanctioned (i.e. legal) march.  They were met by an even larger group of counter-protesters.  Conflict between the groups quickly escalated, and as video evidence has shown, the violence was clearly started by the white supremacists.  Non-violent counter-protesters were defended by anarchists, anti-fascists, communists, and other groups who embraced self defense and black bloc tactics.  The white supremacist march was shut down, and during a period of celebration and regrouping, a young white supremacist drove his car into the crowd, injuring dozens and killing a protester, Heather Heyer.  Other counter protesters were beaten with pipes in broad daylight.  Militia men walked through the streets of Charlottesville as if they were walking the streets of some foreign land, M-16\u2019s and body armor ready.  Throughout it all, the police were nowhere to be seen, \u201cprotecting the perimeter\u201d.  Solidarity demonstrations erupted across the country.  Trump offered a clear support of the growing fascist movement in the country, unwilling to push away his political base.  The liberal media is at a loss, unable to condemn the self-defence of the counter protestors but unwilling to acknowledge that the foundations of our society are crumbling.  The American Civil Liberties Union protects the fascists and white supremacists in the name of \u201cfree speech\u201d while the alt-right is clearly co-opting the tactics of liberalism and nationalism to increase their political power.<br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/59d165b6426f15483ea8386247c2e50be76136d5" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/5/59d165b6426f15483ea8386247c2e50be76136d5.jpg" class="lightbox" title="uva.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/59d165b6426f15483ea8386247c2e50be76136d5_1_690x460.jpg" width="690" height="460"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">uva.jpg</span><span class="informations">720x480 50 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div><br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/c6130e8bab3b379be2420b94120612ff423862fe" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c6130e8bab3b379be2420b94120612ff423862fe.jpg" class="lightbox" title="militia.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c6130e8bab3b379be2420b94120612ff423862fe_1_690x345.jpg" width="690" height="345"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">militia.jpg</span><span class="informations">840x420 100 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>At the end of the month, as the debate in the mainstream media about Russia and tax codes and debt burdens trolled on, the rise of massive \u201csuperstorms\u201d loomed on the horizon of our southern coast.  Houston, the fourth largest city in the US, was hit by the most amount of rain to ever hit the US.  Large swaths of the city are still underwater, a week after the hurricane.  Many people have died, and it is clear that the devastation to the city is just beginning.  Many are arguing that Houston represents the paradigm of massive growth and infrastructure development without any thought to environmental concerns, adding the massive destruction.  In addition, almost a quarter of the refined gas supplied to the US comes through the refineries in Houston, many of which have been damaged.  Mixed with the flood waters runs gas and oil and untold other toxic chemicals, creating the beginnings of an environmental catastrophe.  <img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a50f36cce257d2d0ba76ffe63d6efd4a0cf9b013.png" width="620" height="420"></p>\n\n<p>As the conversation around Hurricane Harvey shifts toward rebuilding, Hurricane Irma is on a straight path towards Miami, Florida.  Miami chronically suffers from daily flooding, again an example of development within floodplains without consideration to climate factors.  Who knows what damage a category 4 hurricane will do to the city.  Our thoughts go to the safety of the residents and all other life there.  Perhaps Irma will miss Florida, ironically a state where the government cannot use the term \u201cclimate change\u201d.  But right behind Irma is Hurricane Jose, their cousin Katia is battering the eastern coast of Mexico and who knows what other family members will show their face during this hurricane season.  In addition, the west coast of the US is on fire, with massive uncontrolled wildfires running across the mountain ranges.  In Bangladesh, a third of the country was flooded, suffering landslides that have killed hundreds of thousands.  As has been clearly shown throughout history, those affected the most by the ravages of capitalism are not the beneficiaries of these systems.<br><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/15f9cddec84ff1a908451adfb36599caf52da8cf.jpg" width="299" height="168"></p>\n\n<p>The question of care looms behind all these thoughts.  How are we to provide care in the broadest sense when people drive cars into crowds?  When unsanctioned militia men walk armed down the street?  When we are being ravaged by storms that are literally larger than the entire state being hit?  The liberalism that infects this country, of trying to find compromise in everything and promotes a sense of powerlessness runs rampant in our culture.  We watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d rather than think that perhaps we have our own white walkers.  We worry about our careers and our next vacation.  I watch the people out of the window heading of to work, assuming that since NYC represents such a nidus of capitalism, that their job somehow continues to facilitate my own destruction.  I think of my own work in an ER, is my job any different?  Am I also continuing to worry about my own individual world, desperately trying to walk a fine line of caring about the world but not letting those thoughts actually influence my life? I ask myself, if I truly think that the fundamental structure of our economics and society are being threatened, why am I paying back my school loans?</p>\n\n<p>Yet through all this depression, there is always hope.  Not that shitty optimism of the hippies or the progressives that are destroying our cultural sense of power.  Not the general hope that everything will be ok, which is such a comfort for the petit bourgeois of this country.  But a hope that we can find each other.  That we can have the courage to face this destruction, and while I do not wish for the superstorms and the violence, it is here and is not going away.  So let us embrace the fact that these represent potential vulnerabilities to the heart of neoliberal capitalism.  That the police will not protect us, that our careers will not save us.<br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/616a364c3e4f905b12bbffe61200ea5e4f04ef61" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/6/616a364c3e4f905b12bbffe61200ea5e4f04ef61.jpg" class="lightbox" title="1060x600-a28c40e3ee7665920d60133a03a24901.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/616a364c3e4f905b12bbffe61200ea5e4f04ef61_1_690x390.jpg" width="690" height="390"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">1060x600-a28c40e3ee7665920d60133a03a24901.jpg</span><span class="informations">1060x600 195 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div><br>Our work cannot be to bemoan the possibility of this destruction, but to build the alternative world that will build on the ashes of this culture.  This past weekend, I stared at the faces of my comrades, washed in the wondrous light of a campfire.  We planned and schemed ways to build a new world together, letting our visions intertwine themselves with the smoke, rising up to the stars above.  This hope exists everywhere.  The OpenVillage conversations are working through the logistical obstacles of coming up with ways of being together across the country.  As the Festival approaches, proposals about different ways to organize communities and tactical tools needed to rebuild worlds abound.  The OpenVillage Festival will be a step in the direction of building an international community that feels the glimmer of hope that a new way of being can be built.  But we must dedicate our lives to it.  I don\u2019t hold answers and often question my own complicity with this devastation.  But it is clear, we must find each other, hold each other through the depression and sadness, fight against the comfort of nihilism, protect our communities from those who would harm it and learn to care for ourselves in ways that can overcome the material destruction of whatever comes.  A new world is possible, we just have to walk it.</p>\n\n<p> "We have nowhere to return to...

CCL is located in the Omni Commons, a large community space that is an old Italian  social club. It has a large ballroom, boxing ring, basements and multiple big rooms hosting organisations. CCL is one of those organisations and the full list is here (<a href="https://omnicommons.org/index.html#about" rel="nofollow noopener">https://omnicommons.org/index.html#about</a>). With names like Food Not Bombs and Liberated Lens you can get a sense of the vibe.

All with more ideas than they have time to do, but loads of energy to have fun experimenting away with biology anyway. I helped out with some yeast lab work and attended several social &amp; project meetups. One of the highlights was a workshop I hosted on mycelium materials together with Bay Area Applied Mycology (BAAM). It attracted 20+ people, all highly interested and motivated to get down to business with the technology. Due to limited resources, we had to hack some things together, which made it all the more interesting. First time I used a cheese grater for science.</p>\n\n<p>Per coincidence I ended up at the 10 year anniversary party of Noisebridge, the infamous hackerspace in San Francisco, where I finally learned how to lockpick (I\u2019m still pretty mediocre).</p>\n\n<p>We discussed and planned for where to go with Open Insulin. The idea of a patient coop to steward the protocol (and the gains from it) gained traction, so we\u2019ll be looking into that during <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/organizing-the-open-science-behind-open-insulin/826">Anthony\u2019s session</a>. We continued the talks at the Global Community Bio Summit, the 4 day event I travelled to Boston for.<br><br><strong>The Bio Summit</strong></p>\n\n<p>The event in Boston was a transformative experience. That was the reaction of most people, including myself, at the end of our time together at the MIT Media Lab. Even the seasoned biohackers, active for many years, had similar sentiments. The Summit brought together 150+ people from all over the world in an inspiring four days.</p>\n\n<p>I was there with two friends with whom I started the biohackerspace in Ghent. The program was packed with anything and everything across the spectrum of diverse initiatives in the biohacking scene. We visited one of the biggest synthetic biology companies in the world, as well as a local permaculture farm. We went to huge makerspaces, local community biolabs and had a great party. There were talks on feminism, VC funding, open source hardware and biodiversity. The people in attendance showed excellent qualities you\u2019d want from a community like that: talent, open mindedness and high energy to change things up.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/1d63152f720aea4f52abf47c5ffbbd411020bfeb" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1d63152f720aea4f52abf47c5ffbbd411020bfeb.jpg" class="lightbox" title="22196412_1414072325375718_5242233218569399240_n.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/1d63152f720aea4f52abf47c5ffbbd411020bfeb_1_690x460.jpg" width="690" height="460"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">22196412_1414072325375718_5242233218569399240_n.jpg</span><span class="informations">900x600 86.3 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div><br><br>Some loose thoughts and conclusions. We are doing well in Ghent. Our view on things is very multidimensional compared to other labs, who are mainly focussed on technology and trying to survive, without all that much worries on socio-economic and political aspects of choices. Not that the latter is required to be good at what you do.</p>\n\n<p>We learned about community engagement. Many successful labs were inward looking communities, providing mainly for their members and the shared resources. In ReaGent we have looked outwards most of the time, trying to service the broader public. Seeing other communities at work was instructive and we\u2019ll be applying certain lessons to our own activities back in Belgium. We\u2019ll definitely put our own fun first more often, which was sometimes traded for servicing other people.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone is open to collaborate and share resources, but no one does it. Over the course of the event, the message did get through to most: we can share more globally to help each other with the hard stuff, like finances. Sharing workshop formats and devices are a direct benefit to many labs\u2019 bottom lines. It just takes asking each other, or contributing to a shared online resource.</p>\n\n<p>We have a sophisticated financial model (or framework) as opposed to most spaces. We did not get the chance to share much in depth, since there was no time in the schedule. Most conversations on the topic were relatively superficial and in the unconference formats it is not so conducive of conversation to hog the speaking time. I see however the merit to synthesize some of our practices into something that is more easily accessible for other spaces.</p>\n\n<p>That, or we overthink it.</p>\n\n<p>The event was very diverse, props to the organizers for making sure. That way we got to meet people from every continent. Especially South-East Asia and South America were strongly represented. </p>\n\n<p>Joi Ito challenged us in the opening talk: are we a movement? After spending these days together, everyone was convinced: we are a diverse, global movement and poised to play an important role in the future of biotech.<br><br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/75a562513dbd17901a73b733d1091a5ea8ac10df" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/7/75a562513dbd17901a73b733d1091a5ea8ac10df.jpg" class="lightbox" title="21993105_10101380313896688_1120921764630502647_o.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/75a562513dbd17901a73b733d1091a5ea8ac10df_1_690x353.jpg" width="690" height="353"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">21993105_10101380313896688_1120921764630502647_o.jpg</span><span class="informations">2048x1048 455 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div><br><br>On the final day, we held an unconference session on Open Insulin. Several people wanted to get involved with their own lab, a group in Ecuador and a group in Mexico. The San Francisco team offered to share resources as well as materials and info. From the past, it was clear that we need a better way to share though. We will try to have local/global facilitators to smoothen the collaboration. I will help out onboarding new groups, from our experiences joining half a year ago.</p>\n\n<p>With more groups, more possible research directions can be pursued. We can also work together better on the same direction, by brainstorming together and distributing the execution of experiments.</p>\n\n<p>There are several initiatives being taken to look more into economics, governance of the IP, policy etc. With a global distribution, different options can be explored and different opportunities can arise. I\u2019m looking forward to ride this learning curve more!</p>\n\n<p>In these hectic weeks leading up to OpenVillage Festival, and our continuous efforts to stay afloat with projects locally, there is little time to process and report deeper on the rapid succession of experiences. I hope to share more live, as a participant at the Festival!<br><br><em>This blogpost has been realised as part of the OpenCare Community Fellowship Program with the support of SCImPULSE Foundation.</em></p>', u'post_id': 37245, u'user_id': 3362, u'timestamp': u'2017-09-30 08:35:21', u'title': u'Global Community Bio Summit'}, {u'content': u'<p>Chaos. It\'s the best feeling I can describe when thinking about my first month as a fellow for the OpenVillage festival. I am working with the Woodbine Health Autonomy group and my co-fellow Nicole. We are based in Queens, NY. </p>\n\n<p>Chaos, like anarchy, are usually viewed as negative terms in our society. They denote disorder and structurelessness. They are usually states of being from which we wish to escape or wish to flee from. But looking at the seeming chaos of storms or of human physiology, it is clear that often times it is the incubator for something even more profound. Be it Einstein\u2019s hair, the genius behind insanity, or the warmth provided by a fire, they all produce \u201ca something\u201d out of chaos. And so in the past month as we dove head first into the chaos of the Edgeryders platform and communication methods, I see something profound being produced. </p>\n\n<p><em>Communication</em> <br>Our first experience with Edgeryders and OpenCare was more than a year ago when we were contacted by members from OpenCare. They had seen a video we produced and were touched by the message. We wrote a blog post and we\'re soon overwhelmed with the format of communication. As one who has weaned himself off of social media and strives to check email once a day, the up-to-the minute communication and breadth of people was overwhelming.  Since then, we have had some interaction with OpenCare and were asked to apply for the fellowship in June, of which we were awarded.  </p>\n\n<p>As above, the communication methods have always been an obstacle for me.  I\u2019ve often wondered why that was the case.  On the one hand, I\u2019m of the generation that is most comfortable with social media and the internet.  I\u2019ve spent literal years of my life diving into social media platforms and online conversations.  For me though, and perhaps one of the founding aspects of Woodbine is a rejection of the internet mentality.  Not to critique its usefulness, but more of a comment on technology\u2019s role in our lives.  For many in the US with counter-cultural ideas of anti-capitalism and revolutionary tendencies, the internet offers a way to create a community.  Similar to Edgeryders, many leftist communities arise on the internet, lending to an ability to share ideas, experiences, and fellowship.  For myself, some of these communities were paramount and life-giving.  One of the lessons from Occupy though was the power of true human interaction.  The mass gatherings, the communal dinners, the encampments all provided a new concept for our internet generation; that it was the building of tangible community that could be the most powerful.  For those who started Woodbine and previous iterations, there was a goal to create a space in which we could remove ourselves from our internet avatars and commune with people in the flesh.  So a big goal of our project was to transition ourselves from thinking of meeting online to meeting in person, to create projects developed from long-term presence and being.  So in that process, I have personally been trying to move away from internet-based means of communication (although I often spend too much time on email!).  It has been a process to begin thinking of the constancy of internet communication and responding to blog comments as the formation of a community.  And I think that is what will make the festival such a success.  That with the continuation of these festivals where people can meet face-to-face, it will form the basis of a much more solid connection than just emails and messages.  Inevitably in our world today, there is always the struggle between the local and the international.  While all true work must come from the local, we are facing massively connected systems of oppression, so we must be ready to fight on that level as well.  </p>\n\n<p><em>The role of words</em><br>As a collective, one of our goals with taking on this fellowship was the ability to add to the growing Edgeryders community, benefit projects that we wish to deepen connections, and stay true to the message we are trying to formulate.  It that vein, I will be transparent in my thoughts throughout these reflections.  I do not mean anything as a critique, but as a way to open doors to conversations and bridges through misunderstanding.  </p>\n\n<p>Woodbine was started as a way to build the material means for revolutionary lives.  We don\u2019t say this sarcastically or pathetically.  Our goal is to build collective power and create a path for a revolutionary life.  It denotes a process, not some distant utopia to be gambled upon.  </p>\n\n<p>Wording is important.  Often the term \u201crevolution\u201d has been used to excuse horrific atrocities and recently has been co-opted by neo-capitalists for their marketing campaigns.  Even terms now used like \u201cautonomy\u201d are signaled by entrepreneurs to co-opt revolutionary language, instead representing the newest \u201ctech\u201d idea or pure individualism.  So one of our struggles has been to elucidate and elaborate on what we understand these words to mean.  It is a process of creating a vision for a new world.  The words of the past have meaning, which is why neoliberalism is so intent on co-opting our collective histories.  </p>\n\n<p>We were recently in a great conversation about the role of wording in our title.  The original title of the theme we are to curate was \u201cLiving and working well together\u201d.  We then changed it to \u201cLiving Communism, Spreading Anarchy\u201d, which was a reference to a book written by comrades in France who have been influential to us.  There were comments around the terms \u201ccommunism\u201d and \u201canarchy\u201d, essentially arguing that perhaps these words are too \u201ccoded\u201d or have too much negative connotation.  After some thought, we changed the title to \u201cRevolutionary Care: Building Health Autonomy\u201d.  We recognized that we are new to the online community and the larger European history of these words, which maybe have different connotations in the US.  But it also brought up questions around being specific about what we as the Edgeryders/OpenCare community are trying to do.  With regards to care, do we view the OpenCare project as a means to fix the problems of state produced care?  Or do we view care as a basic right that is oppositional to the current global model of capitalism and the exclusionary notion of citizenship? Are we trying to reform neo-liberalism with apps or are we trying to fundamentally remove ourselves from its grip so that we can build the power necessary to destroy it?  The crisis we face as a community dedicated to care are caused by an exploitative means of viewing the world, be it climate change, the migrant crisis, and the rise of proto-fascist policies in our countries.  How can we as a community avoid the \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d trap of convincing ourselves we are saving the world through a techno-utopia?  Are we capital-based entrepreneurs or do we wish to build a world in which humanity can flourish?  I bring these questions up as a response to a general tendency in progressives circles to not want to create opposition to power.  So we soften language or we try to be on the middle ground.  But recent events and elections have pointed us to the idea that people are ready for strong language and great visions.  Not all visions lead to totalitarianism.  In the Americas, the indigenous struggles have clearly given us a path from which to follow.  They are clear in their language that they reject the extractive mentality of this culture.  For them, to be for the land and the people is to be anti-capitalist, and the path for their revolution is the daily struggle to build a new world.  Can we as a community be as courageous as them to use the strong language that will make us a beacon to a world of nihilism and distraction?            </p>\n\n<p><em>Community</em><br>Overall, the experience of building this international community has been humbling and inspiring.  From working with Noemi (thank you for being patient with my delays and mishaps!), Nadia, Marco and the rest of the team helping the fellows!  My co-fellows Gehan and Winnie have been such a wealth of information and thought around the festival, happy to be working with them.  And in NYC, Nicole and I are the public faces of a much larger group of folks who are helping behind the scenes with ideas, group suggestions, research, etc.  Much thanks to them all.  </p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" href="/u/amelia">@amelia</a> for her post about Invisible Illness was a great way to describe the covering up of anxiety and angst as a trauma itself.

Let us know what you think and we look forward to the continuing the revolutionary work of building a new world, a world based on care for each other.  </p>\n\n<p>-<em>Frank</em><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n\n<p>Today we enter eclipse season.  It\u2019s a notorious time of flux and upheaval, closures and openings.  On tonight\u2019s full moon I will go out with a friend I\u2019ve made this year through my work at Woodbine and gather mugwort to bind into smudge sticks.  As summer begins its end here, this medicinal plant, which grows abundantly out of the lots and cracks in the sidewalk in Bed-Stuy, is just coming into the height of its magical powers; mugwort, or <em>artemesia vulgaris</em>, has been used traditionally as a stimulator of vivid dreams and a third-eye-opener.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve begun my involvement with Woodbine Health Autonomy, and now with OpenCare, in the midst of a life transition.  I\u2019ve spent the past year orienting away from something that has circumscribed my understanding of myself\u2014who I am, what I\u2019m doing, and where I\u2019m going\u2014for a while now, toward a future that is more unknown.  For the last five years I\u2019ve been pursuing a PhD in art history.  By the end of my fourth year, however, the promises of academia had begun to ring hollow for me.  On the face of it, everything in the academy seems to be running as usual.  Universities keep reiterating the same forms: liberal arts educations, PhDs, lectureships and professorships, grants and post-docs.  Yet, at the very same time as they reiterate their merit and prestige in rhetoric and brochures, with the other hand universities are systematically undermining these entities in the course of running increasingly brazenly like large corporations.  Young academics cling to notions of critical discourse and transformative pedagogy even as they are forced to churn out work ever more rapidly and are saddled with heavier teaching and administrative workloads.  We reflexively assume the eventuality of a bright and stable future even as the university cuts tenure-track jobs and many end up out of work or living near the poverty line without benefits as adjuncts for years.  We are talking about social and economic justice as we watch the university function as a debt machine and factory for reproducing the wealth that has access to it in the first place.  In other words, we\u2019re stuck playing out an atrophied and anachronistic story, attached to ideas that have already expired. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately about genre.  By genre I mean the stories we tell ourselves about our lives and the categories these stories fall into.  Genre is the way our individual narratives conform to certain tropes because what\u2019s possible is delimited by historical circumstances and situational constraints.  Genre is how these tropes gather inertia and reproduce themselves, because it\u2019s easier to maintain a sense of constancy by slotting your life into a recognizable picture than it is to exist with shattering indeterminacy. </p>\n\n<p>In his book on the historical novel, the Hungarian Marxist theorist Gy\xf6rgy Luk\xe0cs talks about moments of what he calls a \u201cparting-of-the-ways.\u201d  Despite the heavily determining effects of class conflict and modes of production in the lives of individuals and societies, there are moments of pivotal decision that emerge when the inherent contradictions produce a \u201ccertain crucial sharpening of social or personal circumstances.\u201d  Luk\xe0cs brings a quote from the German drama Herodes and Mariamne: \u201cTo every man there comes a moment when the pilot of his star hands him the reins.  The misfortune is he does not know the moment, each which passes by may be the one.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Things have stopped working on a mass scale and no elected official\u2014no liberal, conservative, not even a socialist\u2014can salvage them.  At best they can mitigate the damage provisionally\u2014expand healthcare so more people can live to fight for dwindling jobs imperiled by automation, dole out a universal basic income to distract the ranks of the unemployed, support big corporate green energy projects that displace indigenous people from their land, reform prisons, relax immigration, even as carceral capitalism and state violence continues apace, etc.  There\u2019s no going back to the welfare state: \u201cThe transition from the citizen/worker model to the citizen/consumer/customer one means the transition from a welfare regime, based on the enforcement of social and fundamental rights, to social policies intended as the \u2018management\u2019 of social problems.  As subaltern \u2018customers\u2019 and/or \u2018needy,\u2019 we are deprived of full subjectivity and self-determination.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Even as this past year saw new and frightening forms of rupture and instability worldwide, there\u2019s a way in which things also feel perversely stable.  The market ebbs and flows, wealth continues to concentrate in the streets and gleaming towers of New York, London, Shanghai, Dubai.  We keep waiting for our political offices to straighten themselves out, to straighten things out.  We keep going to work, looking for work, buying groceries, watching TV, picking our kids up from school.  We find ways of stabilizing, find stability in what Lauren Berlant calls the <em>crisis ordinary</em>.  She speaks about how genres can function as holding patterns, how we attach ourselves to stories that enable us to move forward\u2014or at least to tread water\u2014even as the these stories are actively harming us and inhibiting our flourishing.  And how could we not cling to narratives that afford us at least a provisional sense of constancy when we have no better option, when we need to pay the rent and put food on the table, when no matter how bad things get they never seem to tip into full-blown collapse?</p>\n\n<p>It is impossible to give up our attachments to outdated, conservative, and harmful stories alone.  If, as Bourdieu says via <a class="mention" href="/u/gehan">@Gehan</a>\u2019s wonderful citation, \u201c<em>our denial, the source of social alchemy is, like magic, a collective undertaking,</em>" so too is overcoming this denial.  It isn\u2019t a matter of simply disabusing ourselves of ideology, of becoming woke, but of building the infrastructures that will enable us to radically reconfigure our narratives of where our individual lives are headed, of what life might mean over the next ten, thirty, one hundred years, without feeling like we are jumping into the void alone.  This is one definition of what revolutionary care means to me.</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t actually have a very good future imaginary.  While some possess much more prescient minds, for better or for worse I\u2019m mostly stuck analyzing what exists in the here and now.  As a historical materialist, I\u2019m especially aware that the limits to our political imaginations aren\u2019t creative, but structural.  The very categories we have to work with\u2014the ways we conceive of time, the past, our bodies and minds and the bodies and minds of others, our assumptions about what has value, what is progress\u2014have been formed in and by the political economic system we are trying to varying degrees to contend with.  We see this play out all the time; development schemes and NGO\u2019s propagating neo-imperialist dynamics, activists caught in a capitalist work ethic, so-called radicals reproducing racialized and gendered dynamics of power and violence. </p>\n\n<p>I think moving toward a truly better future together will entail deep and sometimes brutal examinations of our attachments.  It will mean giving up some of our most closely held notions about ourselves, conceding that things will change in ways we cannot predict, letting others in to a degree that is necessarily uncomfortable.  It will mean agreeing on provisional grounds of commonality knowing that our ideas will morph and evolve, that things will be revalued, that categories we can\u2019t yet imagine will emerge and be swallowed again in the course of things.  It means conceding that we don\u2019t have The Answer\u2014it isn\u2019t an app or a crypto-currency or a rural commune or an urban farm, though revolutionary change may involve all of these things.</p>\n\n<p>I know these are incredibly broad, abstract thoughts.  I\u2019m afraid I have many more like them.  But in the coming weeks and months I hope to think with greater specificity about what they mean in relation to my participation with OpenCare, to the goals of Woodbine Health, to our engagement with the many amazing groups and individuals cohered by this unwieldy and exciting platform, and for the conversations I hope we will have together in October.</p>\n\n<p>As a wayward conclusion to a wayward post, I\u2019ll just say that I like weeds because they\u2019re the abject, valueless.  They\u2019re a reminder to me that the good stares us in the face all the time but we don\u2019t or can\u2019t experience it as such because we\u2019re busy or in pain or because it might not look like a product and maybe we don\u2019t have words or a framing story for it yet. </p>\n\n<p>-<em>Nicole</em></p>', u'post_id': 34103, u'user_id': 3367, u'timestamp': u'2017-08-07 21:07:33', u'title': u'Fellowship Post: Reflections and Wayward Thoughts'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hello Edgeryders (veteran and pioneer),</p>\n\n<p>I was going through the draft program of the event and I would like to share about two concepts that I learned during and after my studies and have been pretty important to me in my work as a peace worker/educator. The fun part about them is that numerous individuals from all walks of life and practitioners from different professions/disciplines have contributed to the development of a solid body of knowledge spanning 20+ years.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Infrastructures for Peace</h2>\n\n<p><strong><a href="https://www.peaceportal.org/web/i4p/i4p" rel="nofollow noopener">Infrastructures for Peace</a>:</strong> \u2018dynamic network of interdependent structures, mechanisms, resources, values and skills which, through dialogue and consultation, contribute to conflict prevention and peacebuilding in a society\u2019.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Establishing a national or MENA \u2018Infrastructure for Peace\' may include:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>development of institutional mechanisms, appropriate to each country\'s culture and context, which promote and manage this approach at local, district and national levels;</li>\n<li>adoption of a cooperative, problem-solving approach to conflict based on dialogue and non-violence, which includes the main stakeholders.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Such an infrastructure can help</strong> a fragile, divided, transitional or societies recovering from violent conflict build and sustain peace by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>managing recurring conflicts over land, natural resources or contested elections;</li>\n<li>finding internal solutions, through mediated consensus or multi-stakeholder dialogue, to specific conflicts and tensions;</li>\n<li>negotiating and implementing new governing arrangements- such as new constitutional provisions- in an inclusive and consensual manner.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Essential components of peace infrastructures can include:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>National, District and Local Peace Councils- comprised of trusted and highly respected persons of integrity who can bridge political divides and who possess competence and experience in transforming conflicts;</li>\n<li>National peace platforms for consultation, collaboration and coordination of peace issues by relevant actors and stakeholders;</li>\n<li>A Government bureau, department or Ministry of peace building;</li>\n<li>Passage of legislative measures to create national \u2018Infrastructures for Peace\' with appropriate budgets;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Based on past practice it\'s features could be:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Expanding the capacities of national peace building institutions, related government departments, Peace Councils and relevant groups of CSOs;</li>\n<li>Establishing an effective early warning and early response system;</li>\n<li>Renewing and using traditional perspectives and methodologies for conflict resolution;</li>\n<li>Promoting a shared vision for society and for a \u2018culture of peace\'.</li>\n<li>These components are not mandatory, but are among the possible pillars for building \u2018infrastructures for peace\'.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The fun part about Infrastructures for Peace is that it can be established top-down, through governmental policies and coordination structures, or bottom-up (as I prefer :D) via local initiatives such as peace committees that may or may not be connected to a national infrastructure, but through a distributed network of Open Care Centers, for example. I am happy to share some case studies in case someone would like to to learn more about the practical experiences in diverse contexts. </p>\n\n<h2>2. Do No Harm as an essential element of conflict sensitivity</h2>\n\n<p>This is a pretty cool concept borrowed from the healthcare and bioethics. <em>Primum non nocere</em> (first, do no harm) is the Hippocratic Oath that all medical students are taught in school. Back in early 90\'s, CDA, a peacebuilding NGO, developed a framework for analyzing the impact of aid on conflict\u2014and for taking action to reduce negative impacts and maximize positive impacts of their work. The \u201cDo No Harm Framework\u201d came from the experiences of people participating in CDA consultations and feedback workshops, including other NGOs, experts, donors, and policy makers collaborated through the project to identify common patterns of interaction between aid and conflict.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Six Lessons of Do No Harm in this brilliant <a href="http://cdacollaborative.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Final-2015-CDA-From-Principle-to-Practice.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">book</a></strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Whenever an intervention enters a context it becomes part of the context. The intervention is placed in the middle, under the context, representing that it is now part of the context.</li>\n<li>All  contexts  are  characterized  by  Dividers  and  Connectors. The context already has Dividers and Connectors. The intervention is between them.</li>\n<li>All interventions interact with both, either making them worse or making them better. The arrows flow from the intervention to Dividers and Connectors because the intervention is having an impact on both. That impact can be negative - Dividers get worse by increasing; Connectors get worse by decreasing. That impact can be positive - Dividers get better by decreasing; Connectors get better by increasing.</li>\n<li>Actions and Behaviors have Consequences (ABC), which create impacts. The flow from the intervention to Dividers and Connectors is the ABCs. Resources and Messages flow from the intervention into the context. These affect Dividers and Connectors, making them either worse or better.</li>\n<li>The details of interventions matter. Conceptually, within the Framework,  this lesson applies earlier as it is integral to understanding the Intervention. </li>\n<li>There are always Options. Where we see impacts from the intervention, we develop options to counter the negative ones. We can also attempt to support the positive ones further. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The fun part about Do No Harm is that there is no formulaic approach to using this tool. It cannot substitute for knowledge or thinking, but it is something a thinking person can use to improve his/her work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DNH has been used  by peacebuilders in the following ways:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>As an initial conflict analysis tool</li>\n<li>For conflict mapping and identifying stakeholders</li>\n<li>As an early warning system by tracking how Dividers are trending</li>\n<li>For identifying areas of shared interest and concern</li>\n<li>To transform mindsets, bringing people to a place where they form and improve relationships with \u201cthe other\u201d</li>\n<li>As a tool for focusing constructive dialogue around shared problems</li>\n<li>To help motivate people to work on peacebuilding themselves</li>\n<li>To assist organizations with their strategic positioning in relation to conflicting parties, in order to establish credibility and relationships (which can support a subsequent expansion into peacebuilding)</li>\n</ul>', u'post_id': 36085, u'user_id': 10, u'timestamp': u'2017-09-12 16:50:20', u'title': u'Theme | Infrastructures for Peace (I4P) and Do No Harm (DNH)?'}, {u'content': u'<p>In a workshop held on september 18th at WeMake I could disseminate and share some elements of the ethnographic research as well as some sounds from previous researches in the hard sciences, anthropology and ethnomusicology.<br>The question we moved from was: how could sounds be important for social research about health and for opencare?</p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6a587271542352d075a7fa00e8243ae5b3c7e6fa.jpg" width="500" height="329"></p>\n\n<p>Among the participants there were anthropologists, DJs, WeMake staff all interested in sound studies about opencare</p>\n\n<p>In first place sounds make evident the dominance of a visual human dimension and the ocular centrality.

We-- Gabriela A. Sanchez and Dana Mahr from the University of Geneva (<a href="https://twitter.com/citizensciences" rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/citizensciences</a>)--want to propose a session where we contextualize socially and historically how civil society has intervened and impacted biomedical knowledge and health care in Western societies. Cases such as the <em>Women\u2019s Health Movement</em> in the 1970s, <em>the Deaf Culture Movement</em>, the <em>Anti-vaccination Movement</em>, and the <em>Pro-anorexia Movement</em>. These explorations helps us understand how social movements can challenge and alter the ways we provide definitions (scientifically and culturally) for things like expertise, health, disease, bodies, and care. The purpose of this reflection is to situate Health Social Movements (HSM) in 2017 and to sketch some of the potentials and pitfalls they face with current social and technological trends like: <em>Big data driven medicine and care</em>, the <em>automatization of health care work</em>, <em>scientific citizenship</em>, the re-emerging <em>discourse of empowerment and participation</em>, the <em>right (or duty) to make individual lifestyle/medical choices</em>, the growing <em>medicalization of many aspects of modern life</em> and its oppositional (but somehow complementary) trend of <em>dissenting established medical practices</em> (like vaccines and pharmaceuticals). </p>\n\n<p>Against the background of these contemporary developments we want to discuss how OpenCare and the themes we discussed during the <a class="hashtag" href="/c/9-openvillage">#<span>openvillage</span></a> gathering could be positioned in the continuous effort of HSM to alter both, the public discourse about care and its policies. We want to open up the debate with questions like: Why do we believe open science and citizen science are helpful in health care? Is <em>participation</em>, <em>openness</em> and <em>choice</em> inherently good? How do we envision shifting dynamics of power between physicians, care-givers, and (informed) patients? Who do they empower?</p>\n\n<h3>Format of Session</h3>\n\n<p>We propose to do a 15 min presentation introducing the session, present basic social concepts and analyze selected examples of HSMs to open a 45 min discussion about possible (un)foreseen failures of contemporary HSMs in creating an inclusive, participatory, individualized, and caring health care movement/infrastructure and develop strategies to properly address them. We believe participants in this session will gain valuable insights into how social movements work by changing the discourse, practice or policies in health care and effect real change. We hope this discussion will also raise new questions and concerns, as well as deep reflexivity of the roles and responsibilities we hold as activists, developers, patients, family caregivers, health-care professionals, policy-makers, etc. </p>\n\n<h3>Thematic hashtags</h3>\n\n<p>health social movements <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/small_blue_diamond.png?v=3" title=":small_blue_diamond:" class="emoji" alt=":small_blue_diamond:"> (de)medicalization <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/small_blue_diamond.png?v=3" title=":small_blue_diamond:" class="emoji" alt=":small_blue_diamond:"> normalization of bodies and minds <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/small_blue_diamond.png?v=3" title=":small_blue_diamond:" class="emoji" alt=":small_blue_diamond:"> pseudo-medicine <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/small_blue_diamond.png?v=3" title=":small_blue_diamond:" class="emoji" alt=":small_blue_diamond:"> the ethico-politics of care <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/small_blue_diamond.png?v=3" title=":small_blue_diamond:" class="emoji" alt=":small_blue_diamond:"> othering <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/small_blue_diamond.png?v=3" title=":small_blue_diamond:" class="emoji" alt=":small_blue_diamond:"> intersectionality <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/small_blue_diamond.png?v=3" title=":small_blue_diamond:" class="emoji" alt=":small_blue_diamond:"> partaking vs dissent vs alternatives <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/small_blue_diamond.png?v=3" title=":small_blue_diamond:" class="emoji" alt=":small_blue_diamond:"> illness as a culture <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/small_blue_diamond.png?v=3" title=":small_blue_diamond:" class="emoji" alt=":small_blue_diamond:"> health as a lifestyle</p>', u'post_id': 34456, u'user_id': 3801, u'timestamp': u'2017-08-17 13:36:25', u'title': u'Session Proposal: How to build a social movement for care in the 21st century?'}, {u'content': u"<p>Hi Edgeryders,</p>\n\n<p>I was wondering there were any examples of alternate models of health insurance that aren't based on total pooling of collected dues?

Research is an important driver for progress in healthcare. It brings us cheaper medicine, cures to seemingly incurable diseases and better therapies. Yet research methods have not evolved much at all to better reflect the needs of patients and citizens. The people whom the research is essentially meant for, are largely left out of the process, with outcomes often shielded behind intellectual property law or unaffordable prices. Citizen science and open science are research philosophies that offer an alternative. This theme at the OpenVillage Festival brings together people and projects with hands on expertise to build on each other\u2019s knowledge in order to push the boundaries further.</p>\n\n<p>To learn more, check the festival program in the making <a href="//edgeryders.eu/t/program/6110">here.</a></p>\n\n<p>#OpenVillage Festival: 19-21 October \n\n<br>\n\nGet in touch: #OpenVillage on twitter | Community@edgeryders.eu</p>', u'post_id': 6392, u'user_id': -1, u'timestamp': u'2017-06-12 14:03:26', u'title': u'Festival Theme #1: Open Science and Citizen Science for more inclusive healthcare'}, {u'content': u'<p>When it comes to social care, it is important to create links between the social movements, in a way they continuously support and feed back to each other, finding solutions that are <strong>creative</strong>, <strong>radical</strong> and <strong>practical </strong>at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>This is what is happening with a visionary project that is linking <strong>alternative</strong> <strong>and cooperative</strong> <strong>economy</strong> with the <strong>needs</strong> <strong>of refugees</strong> in Thessaloniki, Greece. It is a project of a group of people interested in the building of a cooperative economy network, in which I participate as an <strong>activist</strong> and a <strong>researcher</strong> of alternative economy. Having completed my PhD in economics in the last spring, I am now interested in continuing research, exploring links between solidarity economy and refugee solidarity movements in wider Greece.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>This cooperative project is called \u2018<strong>Refugees to Refugees (R2R) Solidarity Call Center\u2019</strong> and it is a project run by refugees for fellow refugees. Its objective is to provide <strong>information</strong> <strong>and advice </strong>for various kinds of issues related to either transit, temporary stay or settlement of refugees in Thessaloniki, but also in wider Greece. At the same time, through its services, it hopes to create <strong>linkages</strong> between refugee communities and the wider solidarity movement, in order to break the exclusion and isolation that refugees are feeling, as a result of being crammed in concentration camps. Strong solidarity networks already exist within the cities, in which teams of lawyers, doctors, translators and networks of families offering hospitality in their homes, are offering voluntary support and practical solutions, whenever needed.</p>\n\n<p>The project is inspiring in its own right, but what makes it even more important and intriguing, is the fact that it is further linked with the efforts to create a <strong>new, fair and solidarity economy</strong> on a larger scale. Having such a vision, the group of refugees and solidary comrades that are supporting them on this, have built a collaborative <strong>network</strong> between the cooperative R2R call center and <strong>cooperative</strong> <strong>grocery</strong> <strong>stores</strong> in the area of Thessaloniki, where the refugee operators of the call center can cover most of their food and other basic needs, using a digital, <strong>alternative</strong> <strong>currency</strong> that is called <strong><em>Faircoin</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The building of a network of alternative economy is being supported by <a href="https://fair.coop/" rel="nofollow noopener">FairCoop </a>on a global level, and in the area of Thessaloniki it seems to be of special value as it can be directed to service needs of refugees. It is certainly not an easy task to achieve and it requires a lot of networking and cooperation, but already a cooperative store and collectives of producers are participating, while there is interest and plans for more to join very soon. What is also very important is that the cooperative stores participating in this network distribute <strong>high</strong> <strong>quality</strong> <strong>food</strong> <strong>products</strong>, produced by fellow cooperatives in Greece or imported through <strong>fair</strong> <strong>trade</strong> <strong>distributions</strong> <strong>channels</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In Thessaloniki and more generally in Greece, there is currently a rise of the cooperative movement, especially as a result of the effects of the ongoing economic crisis, but unfortunately these new initiatives are up to now largely disconnected from each other. To create links between them, means to expand the spaces where solidarity is being practiced, in other words to fill the gaps with <strong>ever</strong>-<strong>increasing</strong> <strong>solidarity</strong>!</p>\n\n<p>My <strong>role </strong>in this project as an <strong>activist </strong>is to work closely with the group of refugees and locals to support the building of the project which requires a lot of work on <strong>communication</strong> and <strong>cooperation</strong>, in order to continue and expand successfully. As an independent <strong>researcher</strong>, I have presented the results of this ongoing project at a conference in Lesvos and hope to continue <strong>documenting </strong>its progress as well as to explore other similar initiatives in Greece.</p>\n\n<p>One last but very important point is that the funds for this ambitious project are being raised through an international campaign of <strong>crowdfunding</strong> in both <strong>euros</strong> and <strong>faircoins</strong>, which are being used to cover incomes of the refugees working in the project and their home rent. Being a cooperative initiative, this means that all the incomes are being <strong>equally</strong> <strong>distributed</strong> among the members, currently four in number, three men from <strong>Gambia</strong>, <strong>Egypt</strong> and <strong>Morocco</strong>, and a woman from <strong>Syria</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to support the R2R solidarity call center and at the same time help expand the bridges between the refugee solidarity movement and the solidarity economy movement, please consider to <strong>donate</strong> using our \u2018coopfunding\u2019 platform or share about the project with your solidarity networks! If you work with refugees in Greece or other countries, interested in the call center\u2019s services or interested in building similar initiatives in the countries where they live, please <strong>share</strong> the phone line\u2019s number and communication e-mail!</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/14c91a29997a3730679a8f30a9a4436e654f519f" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/14c91a29997a3730679a8f30a9a4436e654f519f.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Yaya ice cream 1_0.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/14c91a29997a3730679a8f30a9a4436e654f519f_1_690x460.jpg" width="690" height="460"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Yaya ice cream 1_0.jpg</span><span class="informations">960x640 121 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>Photo credits: Maria Orfanou</p>\n\n<p>Call center tel:<strong> 0030 23111 80903</strong></p>\n\n<p>\xa0E-mail: <strong>Greece@callcenter.coop</strong></p>\n\n<p>Web: <strong>Callcenter</strong>.<strong>coop</strong></p>\n\n<p>Facebook: <strong>Refugees</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>Refugees</strong> <strong>R2R</strong> <strong>Solidarity</strong> <strong>Call</strong> <strong>Center</strong></p>', u'post_id': 792, u'user_id': 3404, u'timestamp': u'2016-10-14 00:10:59', u'title': u'R2R call center: a cooperative developed from refugees to refugees'}, {u'content': u'<p>In August 2015, as the first large waves of refugees started landing on the Greek shores and stuck along the border of Idomeni, I started this initiative of collecting and filling backpacks with first need items for refugees. At first, this has started very modestly, with a few friends organizing clothing donations through the Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/%CE%A3%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CE%A0%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%86%CF%8D%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BDBackpacks-for-the-RefugeesSolutions-for-Homeless-148172338861553/?ref=bookmarks%20" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/%CE%A3%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CE%A0%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%86%CF%8D%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BDBackpacks-for-the-RefugeesSolutions-for-Homeless-148172338861553/?ref=bookmarks" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/%CE%A3%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CE%A0%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%86%CF%8D%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BDBackpacks-for-the-RefugeesSolutions-for-Homeless-148172338861553/?ref=bookmarks</a> . At the beginning, I wasn\u2019t expending such a big response to my call, but volunteers -known and unknown- started visiting my clothing shop in Thessaloniki, bringing clothes and helping out to fill in the backpacks.</p>\n\n<p>Within two months, this action spread virally all over Greece. Over time, I networked with other grassroots initiatives active in refugee care, such as the Alternative Immigrant Centre of Thessaloniki (<span class="mention">@To-Steki</span>) and Oikopolis. In some cases, people followed our instructions and respected our philosophy of unconditional giving, but there have also been problematic cases because there were also people that tried to hijack the process for personal gain.</p>\n\n<p>I have learned to live with the dynamics, and I started helping out at Oikopolis, to create a clothing storage, explaining an internationally used methodology of inventorying, so refugees were able to serve themselves on their own. This system still works, where refugees can come, try and take the clothes they need for free.</p>\n\n<p>While continuing to work with clothes, I now focus on providing school items for children and the campaign has shifted focus. From just catering for refugees, we also provide care for native homeless people. Through a Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/519478964902645/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/519478964902645/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/groups/519478964902645/</a>, we are trying to organize volunteers who adopt the schooling needs/items of children in need. These needs may be covered through a donation of items or money, and this is open to everyone. So far, the stock gathered so far through donations, is enough for about 250 kids. In parallel, I am organizing seminars and crash courses on repairing clothes and upcycling old objects to create, for example, pencil boxes.</p>\n\n<p>There is another task, which is more time-consuming and complex, in terms of research. I\'m in the team-building process that will eventually become a non-profit legal entity, to develop a Handbook for the Management of Material and Resources, in cases of emergency. For example, due to my professional background, I know how to sort and store thousands of clothing items. Somebody else might have other skills. This is also connected with the sharing of knowledge of alternative treatments, practices or hacks, that might offer cheap and practical solutions to people in need. For example, using cocoa powder as a shampoo, or other uses of baking \xa0soda, salt, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I come from Thessaloniki, and my ancestors were refugees. Initially, the response from my immediate environment has been disappointing. My job is in the clothing sector, however, being an elected Municipal Councillor at the City of Thessaloniki, people know my public activity so it was easy to build trust. Furthermore, I am sitting at the Management Board to the Municipal TV100 station. Having many contacts with journalists helped to communicate the action widely. All this combined has resulted in the massive spontaneous response of a community of 1500 citizens from all walks of life. Including people from Europe and the US, who donated waterproof jackets and blankets.</p>\n\n<p>As s municipal councilor, I am in contact with local authorities. Sadly the Municipality responded very poorly, compared to what it could do. Same goes with the Ministry of Immigration Policy. We talked to the consultants, they appreciated our effort, but there was no practical result.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the public sentiment is negative. Mass media shape the opinion that the refugees stopped crossing borders, so people believe that they stopped coming. Others falsely believe that refugees are to blame for anything wrong. And since the beginning of the summer, most volunteers disappeared. This has, inevitably, resulted in a fatigue in the area of refugee care.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I have no other option but continue. I wish to launch a crowdsourcing campaign, so the venture can continue. I imagine of a list of people with different skills, who -in the case of need- will be ready to take up a certain role. A type of inventory of what human assets exist and what everyone can contribute.</p>', u'post_id': 737, u'user_id': 3402, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-09 08:04:24', u'title': u'COSMUS (diy) - One to One: Donating backpacks full of care'}, {u'content': u'<p><em>\u201cPeople who have allergies or sensitivities to certain food additives should check labels carefully.\u201d</em><br><a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/food-additives/en/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/food-additives/en/</a></p><div class="tmp-rtl">\n\n</div>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>Allergo K\xec is a project developed in the frame of <a href="http://wemake.cc/category/mir/" rel="nofollow noopener">MIR</a> (Maker In Residence) activity for opencare at WeMake.

In the case of food allergies the usual and social representation tells about people with food allergies as exceptions of the tacit and shared rule about what should be eaten in a restaurant and how we should behave as \u201cpaying eaters\u201d. We can eat hindi, japanese, italian, tex mex, fast food, but what about serious global issues about food instead of laypeople geography represented by the restaurants? Fast food restaurants are said to be global, but what about global issues about their food when customers ask for a lunch without onion (Star, 1990)?<br>Moreover, it is a real contradiction between health global issues and how restaurants shape customers when we pass from the view in the food industry to the one shared by the World Health Organization tells about something that sounds like: we have on one side the \u201cnormal\u201d people, while on the other \u201cthose who cannot eat this or should check labels carefully\u201d.<br>Food allergy is a rising global health problem and, as reported on the White Book on Allergy (WAO, 2013), it was in 2013 a problem for 240 million people up to 550 million. In Europe (Mills, et al., 2007) numbers are also impressive and count between 11 and 26 million people interested by the problem. These statistics are of course not updated and the situation might have become much critical. There is concern about GM foods (FAO, 2001). The same White Book includes in the key statements about food allergies: the issue of quality of life of sufferers (mainly children) and the need for advocacy of \u201cstakeholders\u201d that \u201cmust be prepared to meet the needs of patients by enhancing the diagnostic process, the traceability of responsible foods, and the availability of substitute foods, assisting hospitalized patients, and preventing mortality\u201d (p.54). Although labelling such people as patients, the problem is tangible in the healthcare world, but less outside and in the wide social context of food industry and restaurants where it is still considered a sort of exception that may not occur in the daily work routine while is about a growing percentage of possibile customers.<br>Read more about Allergo K\xec challenge: <a href="https://legacy.edgeryders.eu/en/allergoki">https://legacy.edgeryders.eu/en/allergoki</a></p>\n\n<p>FAO 2001 \u201cEvaluation of Allergenicity of Genetically Modified Foods\u201d Report of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Allergenicity of Foods Derived from Biotechnology 22 \u2013 25 January <a>ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/007/y0820e/y0820e00.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>Mills EN, Mackie AR, Burney P, Beyer K, Frewer L, Madsen C, Botjes E, Crevel RW, van Ree R. 2007 \u201cThe prevalence, cost and basis of food allergy across Europe\u201d.

How does the environment we build shape the way we feel and interact? This interactive session explores the ways that architecture shapes our physical, social, emotional bodies. In offering a series of exercises designed to help us reclaim our right to behave and move freely in the spaces we inhabit, this work aims to innovate the vocabulary for embodied architecture that sensitize us to our surroundings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About School of Apocalypse</strong><br>School of Apocalypse (SoA) examines the connections between creative practice and notions of survival. In light of growing cultural, ecological and technological phenomena that challenge basic assumptions about human existence, SoA offers courses and programming that seek to develop new modes of inquiry and apply broader levels of experience to intellectual investigation. SoA has no fixed definition of survival, but engages with the fundamental questions that the themes provoke. We understand the creative potential of a school to be a space in which shared experience generates deeper insights and can lead to alternative cultural systems. The school invites a range of thinkers, artists and scientists to present programming on related themes. Subjects of study are theoretical as well as hands on, and emphasize the integration of observational and material practices found in mystical traditions, creative modalities and scientific field work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Workshop Description</strong><br>Space has a strong impact on the ways our bodies move. It\u2019s design is rarely arbitrary, and yet its power over us so often remains invisible. The presenters offer a series of instructions to explore any space with our bodies in order not to fall victim to mindless obedience within it. The group has produced a soundtrack and manual that can be used by anyone at anytime to investigate the ways in which architecture and the environment influence the body and vice versa. Expanding the vocabulary used to describe this experience can then enable us to have productive conversations about the power of our surroundings and designing to optimize agency.</p>\n\n<p>This session explores different ways of learning, helping participants widen their awareness and expand their openness to the inputs of the world around us. The body is an exceptional vessel to receive and inform the wisdoms of space.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Participant Engagement</strong> <br>Workshop participants will have the opportunity to engage both mentally and physically throughout the session. The workshop is constructed in three parts. In part one, the presenters will introducing the goal of the group\u2019s work - to better understand and more actively engage with the ways that space impacts the body, and vice versa. The facilitators will provide context and case studies for the this research, and will then share their research methodology. Part two will give workshop participants the opportunity to enact the research. A fifteen- or thirty-minute audio piece will guide the workshop facilitators and participants alike through a series of prompts and sounds which will expose the ways in which the space that contains this very workshop provides the groundwork for certain kinds of thought patterns, behaviors, and experiences. (Here is the link to a 5-minute version of the audio piece: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bodiesintersectbuildings" rel="nofollow noopener">https://soundcloud.com/bodiesintersectbuildings</a>). During part three, participants will discuss the ways in which the soundtrack, and the ideas presented over the course of the workshop, were and were not effective in growing awareness and interest in sensitizing their given professional fields to the body. All participants will leave the workshop with a manual entitled \u201cHere You Are: How to Experience Your Body in Space.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Till soon!<br>Eugenia Manwelyan<br>Choreographer, Ecologist, Founding Faculty of School of Apocalypse</p>', u'post_id': 35958, u'user_id': 3973, u'timestamp': u'2017-09-11 02:16:27', u'title': u'Session Proposal by School of Apocalypse: "Here You Are :: How to Experience Your Body in Space"'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hi Edge Ryders!

One public facing service we offer through the engineering and fabrication wing of b(x), BxM, is building loft structures for friends and friends of friends. Many of the members of b(x) practice intentional physical movement as a reaction to modern sedentary expectations.  This has led to an emergence of weekly calisthenic exercise groups in the various parks of NYC, more focused movement clinics for interested non-Biosphere(x) peoples, and team practice of field tactics. With this non-exhaustive list of programs we aim to maintain a readiness to address uncertainties of the future, as well as stay rooted in the present. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s evident to us that changes are predicated upon small consistent steps. Between every monthly public facing project are smaller daily practices and rituals. For every harvest there are many sowings, for every skill share there are numerous meal preps. It\u2019s not that we have discovered something new, but more an acknowledgement of the long now. It\u2019s our hope that as a group we will ultimately construct the reality we seek, and be able to be of service to other individuals and groups in a common struggle against industrial complexes and spiritual death. </p>\n\n<p>We look forward to interacting with people on here leading up to the OpenCare event.

How do we create communal lives? We want to be free from physical want, we want pleasure and connection with those around us, and we want purpose. We want to laugh over good food, to have the time and mental space to enjoy a sunset, to feel good about our children\'s future, to take care of our loved ones and be taken care of in turn, to commune with the natural world around us. And we must be clear, in their real, rather than commodified, exclusionary form, these desires are inherently revolutionary. They are incompatible with a capitalist world that atomizes us as individuals, divides us as members of precarious classes, and makes us physically and mentally ill.  </p>\n\n<p>The question is not why, it is how. How do we build a life with those around us? How do we create a world in the ruins of the old?  </p>\n\n<p>Building a life together means we must reconsider every aspect of our lives. Our urban gardens, our communes, communal dinners, elder-care, child-care practices, mental health practices, the riots, the side hustles for money, manipulations of institutions, shoplifting habits.  </p>\n\n<p>How do we deal with money? How do we create beauty? How do we struggle through patriarchy and oppression within ourselves? How do we provide care? What structures do we need to create? What lessons can we learn? What inspires us? What are we scared of? How can we create optimal conditions for our children and our elderly?

It took 3 years to learn what to eat, and another 3 to learn the truth of \'you are what you eat\' , and at this stage I would assert that you are also HOW you eat, as in - how you supply sustenance to self and kindred. </p>\n\n<p>2016 was the first year since 2008 that I was not hospitalised, and going strong since, the reason for this has been the slow acknowledgement that "we are the soil", or in more precise terms, our health depends on the bacterial ecology of the gut and this depends on the health and bacterial ecology of the soil (all of which is \'the ancestor\' if you think about it deeply enough). Food shaped food , grown in chemical soup, with only 3 of 62 micronutrients, will not cut it. </p>\n\n<p>In 2014 I secured the first 8k of funding from Plunkett and Carnegie on their Growing Livlihoods Program,  we started in March of 2015 with a quarter acre under 6 foot of mess and brambles, littered with litter, broken glass, and surface detritus. Beneath all of that though, there was a gold untouched by the chemical agriculture model whose manure had come from organic fields during the 300 year history of its use as an urban kitchen garden. </p>\n\n<p> Today, based on the near-basic-income of a post surgical disability allowance from the government, with passion, hard work, reasonable communication skills, and a whole lot of help in the driving of it, we have a beautiful space, feeding participants in our \'food commons\' , and working projects with the community mental health centre, intellectual disability groups, schools, rehabilitative care clinics, and the general public. We also run research trials with DIT\'s Engineers   Without Borders on biochar, built 9 biodigestors on the island in 8 days with nat-geo explorer TH CULHANE,  welcomed OS Ecology inventor Daniel Connel for wind turbine workshops, grow food for conscious creativity events, started a local cottage market to support small scale producers, initiated a local inter green schools program, a community woodland, a community garden in a neighbouring village, an ecotouristic bee project, education and training with the national education network, etc.-and-ting. </p>\n\n<p>So far we raised over 20 k for what is a relatively small project, now three urban and social gardens, and are looking to greater heights for the work to come on what will be our residential site at Tullanisk, a three acre walled garden with four bedroomed house, space for a yurt, and rich earth to bring to fruition in the service of the land, it\'s people, their health, resilience, and joy in what will otherwise be hard times for a country importing 98% of their vegetal foodstuffs.  </p>\n\n<p>A point on the why...Within months of the Normans coming to Ireland it is noted that "they became more irish than the irish themselves". In effect, your consciousness is cumulative and you contain billions of \'individual\' life forms (there is no such thing as individual but for the whole you see). The normans ate from the soil, and became of the land. This is health and rectitude. The modern human is disconnected from others, from true self, from the land via work and food, and from the earth and all of its depth thereby. </p>\n\n<p>For quite some time I have urged the tech community to put down roots. To date I have figured out the techniques of doing this, both practical, having trained with the legend Jim Cronin for 9 months, and structurally through time on the Community Land Trust research and development group at the Royal Institute of Architects, Ireland. I currently work with PJ FITZPATRICK,  a leading software and app developers and former high finance exec. whom I met in hospital the last time I was there, me for post surgical rehydration, he to have his bowel removed, a process I had been through years earlier.</p>\n\n<p>There would be no such things as Crohns,  IBC, colitis, etc if not for our building into the world the shortcomings of our own nature. These are centralist, they deny the value of untramelled nature and simple work, they demand privilege and power over submission to the greater order of this earth, and they will get us all in big trouble in the very short term. We have open and honest work to do in which we take long hard looks at ourselves and what we are at,  take the self-protectorate lens off, and begin to do what, and as, needs be done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Things team Edgeryders might note</strong> - a \'venture\' was the name given to the expedition of the \'adventurer\', who formed a \'company\' of mercenaries, and continued to plunder the material resources of others for their own and their masters profit. Those who \'invested\' in the \'shareprice\' of such \'ventures\' divided amongst themselves the spoils of these journeys of rape pillage and murder without thought of the moral \'externalities\' protected in the eyes of the law by \'royal patent\'. I am not a venturer, nor a company-man, nor an investor, nor do I want any part of it all as one cannot build white houses of black bricks. By your admission of having \'some ideas about non-extractive business models\' you openly acknowledge the extractive nature of your current setup. Intellectual and creative resource is little different to the material. </p>\n\n<p>While this approach exists, I will take no part in the doing. But if you can approach the Regenerative, and as principle of action, then I will work with you, and train your growers in the how and why of the soil such that they might feed you as you do your thence good work. </p>\n\n<p>We have site and situation for the training, and it is not only how to x, but as anything connected deeply, it will ever be how to x in relation to the entire alphabet of the present predicament. We also have partners through which to engage higher order structural approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Contact me directly at birrgrowery@gmail.com</p>', u'post_id': 35053, u'user_id': 147, u'timestamp': u'2017-08-30 10:59:54', u'title': u'Food Health Work Soil (in reverse order) Getting your shit together'}, {u'content': u'<p>I am working on two major projects: Engineering Comes Home and Vital. Always environmentally focussed, broadly in care.</p>\n\n<p>Engineering Comes Home ask the question of \u201cHow can communities of non experts be involved with infrastructure designers to make infrastructures that meet their needs?\u201d It is in development as a co-design toolkit for new infrastructure design (food, energy, waste, water). It brings together ethnography, workshop practice and rapid prototyping. It is mainly aimed at citizens and infrastructure designers. The project is realised in collaboration between iilab, University College London and Newcastle University.</p>\n\n<p>Among other things, we developed a prototype \u201ccalculator\u201d to measure environmental impact to look at the possible resources people can steward in their neighbourhood.</p>\n\n<p>The first iteration of the project was done with one community in London, with good results in terms of infrastructure outcomes and satisfaction and feedback from community stakeholders. We gained insights into involving citizens in a complex subject matter and increasing their over their stake in it. A first implementation of rainwater stewardship has been installed in collaboration with KloudKeeper, and during the final workshop we came up with a plan for increasing the scope of rainwater stewardship by the community that can move forward with minimal support from the ECH team.</p>\n\n<p>Vital is a collection of processes to interrogate our relationship with food. Delivered as a series of workshops, techniques include DIY micronutrient analysis as well as mindful eating (eg. aesthetic experience), forum theatre and foraging. The process ends with participants co-creating installations and interventions for an exhibition that synthesises these perspectives on food, allowing participants to explore what sparks their interest to create something new and internalise the knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>In the first iteration of the project, preliminary feedback shows that engagement with these processes has changed the attitudes of the participants towards food. The group of young people who participated started out caring only about the calorie content of food. After seven weeks their attitudes had changed and they were reflecting on their personal eating habits, cultural and aesthetic aspects of eating, as well as bringing to the fore social and financial inequalities that affect the availability of different food, which emerged from the participants\u2019 drawing on everyday life experience. Next up is a collaboration with a DIY spectrometer project to measure better micronutrient content. The aim is not to measure toxins, but to make a deeper appreciation for food and the environment.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m a big believer in experiential and collaborative working to create change. This is part of the design in the projects and art work. All these projects are open source, with documentation being put online over the summer. </p>\n\n<p>During a session I would share experiences and showcase these projects, and if there\u2019s interest I can also demo a workshop from ECH or Vital. </p>\n\n<p>If people are excited about it, we can adapt the infrastructure co-design toolkit during a longer workshop, so that it can be used for different communities to co-design their infrastructure/living environment. I\u2019d also like to discuss opportunities to roll Vital out more widely around the globe.</p>\n\n<p>Alongside the specifics of these projects, I\u2019d also like to discuss strategies to make these kinds of projects self-sustainable. For instance, a few years ago I participated in an Edgeryders conference with the Open Droplet project. The goal was a device to non-invasively measure water flow. The data was owned by consumers, rather than companies. It led to lobbying for more open data and community stewardship of resources within UK water policy. The project is now on hold as it didn\u2019t find a way to get the required funding, though it morphed a little into the Engineering Comes Home project. I\u2019d like to explore funding more with others during the festival, drawing on discussions I\u2019ve been having with other DIY science pracitioners.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue is how to disseminate outputs of projects, like exhibits, conferences etc. It\u2019s a lot of work and feels like a drop in the ocean sometimes. It\u2019s hard to reach central actors like the European Commission or other government, who can create real change, which is the goal.</p>', u'post_id': 33560, u'user_id': 2362, u'timestamp': u'2017-07-25 11:56:44', u'title': u'Proposal for a session'}, {u'content': u'<p><strong>Description:</strong> A panel on different models for how to build mental health care into the structures of communities, such as universities, cohousing projects, and neighborhoods. I see this session operating in two possible ways. </p>\n\n<p>The first way is for several people who have worked on creating support systems to introduce their communities, as well as what frameworks they have used. When discussing their frameworks, they should talk about advantages/disadvantages, the process involved in implementing these plans and how they have adapted them to their communities. Followed by an audience Q&amp;A.</p>\n\n<p>If other possible participants haven\u2019t used any framework or plan and instead worked addressing their community needs as they noticed the need (which is not uncommon in many communities), the other option would be for all of us to introduce our communities. And then I would discuss the JED Foundation\u2019s Framework for Success and how we adapted it to Minerva (my university). From there we could discuss how this framework could be used and tailored to each community represented on the panel. Followed by an audience Q&amp;A.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Takeaways:</strong> One or more frameworks for developing the mental health care of your community. And advice on strengths and pitfalls of each from people who have used them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Needs:</strong> Additional Panel Participants willing to share their experiences. A better understanding of the scope of the Creating Situations for Healthy Experiences session to make sure they are strong complements and don\u2019t overlap.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Background:</strong> I\u2019ve worked in my university\u2019s Mental Health Team as an intern for almost two years. In that time I got to help in developing our support system plans in three countries. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Who Might be Interested in this Session:</strong> Those working and living in communities of care, other universities, and people in the mental health field.

When I was 15, I was\xa0accepted into the Palo Alto Police Department\u2019s first student police academy and then became police explorer upon graduation. Over the next 6 years I volunteered with the Palo Alto police\xa0department in a many capacities. Through hundreds of hours of riding along with the police I got\xa0a deep understanding of law enforcement infrastructure. I saw numerous people challenged by\xa0homelessness, mental illness, and substance abuse who were caught in the revolving door of the\xa0criminal\xa0justice/emergency medical system. A year after aging out of the explorers program I lost\xa0a former high school friend to suicide.</p>\n\n<p>When I was 23 I did a ride along with \u2018CAHOOTS,\u2019 (crisis assistance helping out on the streets)\xa0an organization that does civilian crisis response in Eugene, OR.

We offer an alternative to 911 for non-violent crises and respond using the harm reduction model.

Our coordinated teams of responders help connect individuals challenged by homelessness, mental illness, and substance abuse, to the resources they need. These resources include local mental health, physical health, and shelter services. In addition, our ongoing case management program encourages clients to maintain their connection to these support services by promoting clients\u2019 sense of self-worth through alternative methods like art and music collaboration.</span></p>\n\n<p></p>', u'post_id': 728, u'user_id': 3390, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-02 11:02:40', u'title': u'Creating a Compassionate Alternative to 911'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hey there everybody!</p>\n\n<p>My name\'s Kenneth and I\'m based in Galway in the west of Ireland.</p>\n\n<p>I\'m keenly interested in the myriad of ways that Internet of things projects can be applied. I grew up with my father as a Network Sys Admin and general electronics affectionado so from an early age I had a love for IT and computing in general.</p>\n\n<p>I\'d never wanted to learn to code until I found the Raspberry Pi as it gave me a means to an end to achieve something physical with a device. That\'s when it all changed for me and a lot of the barriers I\'d made for myself and a love for making came along.</p>\n\n<p>The Pi, using a version of Linux, Raspian, which is based on Debian {which I\'d worked with alongside my father} then meant I was able to hit the ground running and really get a kick out of IoT dev boards. I\'ve participated in several of the Hackathons in one of Dublin\'s colleges, DCU and very much got the bug.</p>\n\n<p>I had a group of friends that had just started a Social Enterprise whereby they had gotten permission to take a brownfield site in the center of Dublin and then construct an 11 x 5 metre geodesic dome, in which they would both have a community space, while also having it be an intensive food producer by having an over head hydroponics system, controlled with IoT devices.</p>\n\n<p>I\'d worked out an array of analogue sensors linked to an arduino, which would then feed their data over to a MYSQL database hosted on the raspberry pi. Then there was a website which would interpret and display that database onto a website hosted on the same pi. This then enabled more awareness of the growing space and control through remote intervention through the use of reporting and the likes of relay switches to turn devices on and off.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.thegrowdomeproject.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.thegrowdomeproject.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>I\'d like to learn more about what people are doing and perhaps to see what I could become involved with too {<img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">}</p>', u'post_id': 880, u'user_id': 3707, u'timestamp': u'2017-07-10 10:18:58', u'title': u'Irish IoT / Geodome enthusiast :)'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hi Guys</p>\n\n<p>This is about the big announcement we are making about the OpenVillage Festival on Twitter.

Through a Twitterstorm!  </p>\n\n<p>For those of you who are unfamiliar with this format it\'s like <strong>a massive press conference where everyone is talking to everyone on twitter</strong>. Think of it as a flashmob on the internet</p>\n\n<p><strong>The audience participates by opening two twitter windows.</strong> One in which they are following the <span class="mention">@edgeryders</span> account. In the second one they do a search for the <a class="hashtag" href="/c/9-openvillage">#<span>openvillage</span></a> hashtag and watch the search results. <br></p>\n\n<p><strong>People who follow the <span class="mention">@edgeryders</span> twitter account get the <em>big</em> story about what is happening</strong> for those who have never heard about it - told in one 140 character sentence at a time. <br></p>\n\n<p><strong>People who follow the <a class="hashtag" href="/c/9-openvillage">#<span>openvillage</span></a> hashtag search results get a large amount of tweets from many different accounts talking about the same thing.</strong> They get a big diversity of tweets from twitter accounts because different members of the community are telling their own version of the story focusing on what is especially relevant or interesting about the OpenVillage project and festival for them and their audience.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Why should You Participate?</strong></h2>\n\n<p><strong>Good for you:</strong> You can feature your own project as part of a massive conversation where many people are paying attention. Because you can quickly meet others in the community and get an overview of what is happening. Because together we draw a lot of attention to the bigger story and collective effort to make social impact - you can show how your own work is an important part of big movement and that it should be supported!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Good for everyone:</strong> This action is a good way to show people who are struggling to make the world a better place that they are not alone.

For School of Apocalypse, the proverbial end of times offers a glimpse into the beginning of a new one.</p>\n\n<p>School of Apocalypse (SoA) is a New York City based radical learning community.  They find their inspiration from the emerging feeling so many of us have about fundamental shifts that are occurring in the world.  The idea of the apocalypse is not so much a cataclysmic event, but the sense that the time we are inhabiting is ending and that something new must emerge.  Their goal is to dive into that feeling, unpack its hidden dimensions, and create the cultural language to help us define it. As they describe, \u201cFor us, apocalypse isn\'t quite a destination but a horizon, an idea that always exists somewhere in the near future, just ahead of us. As we look towards it, it reflects back our fears and desires. Thinking through apocalypse can therefore foreground creativity and survival, and strip away our pretensions to reveal truths about what is essential.\u201d  They have no definition for survival, but rather are interested in the questions that arise from it.  What is essential for us today?  Tomorrow?  Is survival enough? And since death and change are both inevitable, what do we mean when we say survival? </p>\n\n<p>For them, school is a broadly defined notion that provides a framework for shared knowledge to emerge.  Through pedagogy that is  \u201cplace-based, participatory, experiential, and collaborative,\u201d knowledge is not an accumulated as a set of facts, but is instrumentalized to create new models of thought, behavior, and culture. As they go through this process of \u201cschool,\u201d they investigate what it means to be part of a community of learning.</p>\n\n<p>One of the ways this school convenes courses is through working groups, which are self-directed autonomous groups that come together around a topic for a 3 month period and share their findings with the rest of the SoA community through a final project (which can take any form).  Some recent working groups include:</p>\n\n<p>Choreographies for Survival: \u201cinvestigates the resilient body and the generative culture space that emerges between bodies that engage in creative acts together.</p>\n\n<p>Survival Library: \u201caims to consolidate and contribute to an ongoing collection of publications and media works centered around the personal narratives of W/Q/T/POC.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Bodies Intersect Buildings ii: \u201cdevelops a choreography for raising body awareness in space.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Greenhouses and Bio-art Systems: \u201cexplores the various different aspects of how artistic practice and theory aids in the development of human-centric ecosystems, their biological functionality and the implementation of a living artistic form as a tool for habitat survival and stability.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>SoA brings together artists, thinkers, doers, makers, creatives, among others to think through the chaos of the Apocalypse, hoping that a new cultural imagination is on the other side.  </p>\n\n<p>To learn more and find out about the next SoA meeting (always free and open to the public), visit them online:  <a href="https://www.schoolofapocalypse.org" rel="nofollow noopener">School of Apocalypse</a></p>\n\n<p>Also see their proposal for the OpenVillage Festival: <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/session-proposal-by-school-of-apocalypse-here-you-are-how-to-experience-your-body-in-space/7016">"Here You Are: How to Experience Your Body in Space"</a></p>', u'post_id': 36167, u'user_id': 3367, u'timestamp': u'2017-09-13 22:28:57', u'title': u'School of the Apocalypse'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hey all,</p>\n\n<p>Just wanted to introduce a podcast that we\'ve started through the Woodbine Health Autonomy group.

The air polluting our lungs, our breast milk filled with toxins, and our mental angst driving us to suicide. Proposed health cuts increase our general precarity in relation to a failing health system, a health system that fundamentally furthers our objectification and dependency on capital. Therefore the steps we make to gain and share skills and develop subterranean practices of care can return some of the agency we\u2019ve lost to the professionalization of medicine and the profitable mystery that is our bodies. As we think about expanding our capacity, we don\u2019t want to just \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d of public health infrastructure. We need to slowly break our dependence on these institutions in all the ways that we can and also look for ways to use them to our advantage. We think this happens through sharing knowledge and skills, an emphasis on preventative care, and finding ways to manipulate existing structures to allow us to move forward on this path of autonomy. We believe in the utter necessity of revolution, of the development of material lines of power. Questions of care and health autonomy are pivotal to that progression. From the Greek solidarity clinics to the Zapatistas \u201chealthcare from below\u201d to Black Panther Clinics and GynPunks, there is inspiration for this path all around us. We begin by finding each other. This podcast will be a step in that journey."</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/health-autonomy/id1279639722?mt=2" rel="nofollow noopener">Health Autonomy at the End of Empire</a>  </p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.maskmagazine.com/the-rant-issue/work/introducing-maskfm" rel="nofollow noopener">Mask.fm</a></p>', u'post_id': 35814, u'user_id': 3367, u'timestamp': u'2017-09-08 15:54:01', u'title': u'Health Autonomy at the End of Empire Podcast'}, {u'content': u'<p>Parallax Press just published The Idealist\'s Survival Kit. 75 Simple Ways to Avoid Burnout,\xa0a "tool kit" designed to support nonprofit staff, volunteers, activists and all those engaged in social\xa0social change and humanitarian work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A kind of "unGuide to doing good stuff and keep sane".\xa0</strong></p>\n\n<p>People with daring vision and edgy ideas pour their soul into their projects.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES:<br>1. A successful model of 1000 Egyptian youth gathered together on the idea of \u200b\u200bdeveloping Egypt.<br>2. Increase the percentage of internal investment.<br>3. Development of internal and external tourism through model work for the Maldives, Malaysia and Thailand in Egypt. (Tourism islands) and these are the most places where the Egyptians in their travel.<br>4. Establish agricultural and industrial projects without harm to the environment and not rely solely on tourism.</p>\n\n<p>II. THE CAUSE OF THE SELECTION OF JIFTUNE ISLAND:<br>1- The length of the island of Jiftun is 18 km and the length of its coast is 43 km.<br>2 - away from Hurghada 11 km and this makes it easy to take advantage of the services available in Hurghada.<br>3 - Includes 14 sites of the most beautiful diving sites.<br>4 - receive about 188 thousand tourists annually and therefore do not need to campaign for a large awareness of the place.<br>5. Exploitation of the island comes from entrance fees only island.<br>Third: The reason for exploitation of natural islands and reserves in Egypt:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Australia generated revenues of $ 2.5 billion<br>2 - Canada achieved $ 6.5 billion in addition to providing 125 thousand jobs.<br>3 - Italy achieved one billion euros in addition to providing 80 thousand jobs.<br>Mauritius Island receives about 1,500,000 tourists annually.<br>Thus, the importance of exploiting the islands in Egypt to increase national income, create job opportunities for young people, and work successful models of Egyptian youth capable of taking responsibility.</li></ol>\n\n<p>IV. How to choose 1000 young people:<br>The 1,000 young people from all over the country will be selected by a dedicated HR team<br>The lesson in selection criteria are:<br>1. Ethics.<br>2. Ambition.<br>In order to avoid the negatives resulting from the poor morals and frustrations that exist in society now<br>\u2022 After selecting individuals<br>Each member of the island has a membership card and the card has a number of points and if the person has committed any offense<br>The number of points owned shall be deducted according to the type of violation committed (of course, the sanctions regulation) and if the individual has exhausted the number of points owned by him<br>He is thankful for his time spent on the island.<br>The number of points is also increased for individuals who are positive in helping the people of the island and thus giving them greater advantages based on their positivity<br>\u2022 The island is not limited to 1000 young people only, but they represent the population in the General Assembly of the island in accordance with the regulations of the team of human resources.<br>\u2022 The expected number of people on the island will be reduced to 50 thousand and jobs will be provided to them in the available fields.</p>\n\n<p>V. ELECTRICITY:<br>Only clean energy generated from:<br>1. Solar energy.<br>2. Winds.<br>3. Water rush.<br>4. Power generation by movement (bike).</p>\n\n<p>VI. WATER:<br>Studies in Egypt have proved that if we move away from the Nile River 70 km, desalination is the economic option<br>Therefore, seawater desalination will be used to provide water for drinking and agriculture.<br>VII. Sanitation<br>Sewage will be treated to be suitable for irrigation of gardens and agriculture.</p>\n\n<p>VIII. Means of transportation:<br>You will be able to use environmentally friendly transportation such as bicycles and golf cars that are powered by electricity<br>IX. HOUSES:<br>Wooden houses is the perfect choice that has been chosen for various reasons:<br>1. Do not harm the environment.<br>2 - Economic price interview with concrete houses.<br>3 - her aesthetic view.<br>4 - the ability to withstand the various environmental factors more than others.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>and now i make start-up company in carpooling field to solve transportation crisis, traffic, and Car air pollution in the Egyptian society.</p>', u'post_id': 35613, u'user_id': 3887, u'timestamp': u'2017-09-06 11:30:09', u'title': u'A community of Egyptian creative youth on Jiftun island'}, {u'content': u'<p>There are a number factors that contribute to organisational sustainability. In my experience some key ones are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>that you have good work with a clear purpose and that the values and vision of the organisation are coherent and alive;</li>\n<li>that people are able to work together and sort out differences;</li>\n<li>that the resources are sufficient - there are enough coming in to support the work that needs to take place.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Financial sustainability has remained a persistent task for GalGael, as it is for many organisations. This was a particular challenge during August and mostly likely for some months to come. It\u2019s an issue that regularly features in posts on the Edgeryders platform and I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be plenty of experience to share at the <a href="/t/id/6427">Edge of Funding</a> panel planned for OpenVillage.</p>\n\n<p>Supporting the development of program content and other curating work has been welcome respite from these challenges.

Other forms of organisational and personal sustainability seem less important and while time management tools encourage us to move out of the \u2018urgent quadrant\u2019 and spend more time on the important aspects of our work, the reality of achieving this can feel perversely elusive.</p>\n\n<p>The three original themes <a href="/t/id/6632">have been blended</a> for Open Village program to reflect the overlap and interconnection. The fellowship allows me to continue following the thread of the Architectures of Love theme \u2013 I\u2019m still curious about where it might lead and what it might reveal. I guess that curiosity stems from a sense of something \u2018important\u2019 happening out of the corner of my eye and while all my attention is consumed with numbers, spreadsheets and plans \u2013 I\u2019ve never had much chance to give this my full attention. I\u2019m curious to see what would be revealed if we paid more attention to creating the conditions to bring about desired outcomes - such as health in our organisations - rather than see these as \u2018outputs\u2019 of our clever plans and policies?</p>\n\n<p>Margaret Wheatley and Deborah Frieze\u2019s book <a href="http://walkoutwalkon.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">Walk Out Walk On</a> describes the principle of \u2018start anywhere, follow it everywhere\u2019. In a world of constant flux it seems like a useful approach and one which they describe as generating changes in education, public safety, arts, ecology and food in Joubert Park in Johannesburg. They make the point that this is a more productive approach than forms of social change dependent on assumptions that large and complex issues must be addressed one by one, with institutions and experts who specialise in that particular problem.</p>\n\n<p>So in \u2018following it everywhere\u2019 I\u2019m continuing to look for insights on this topic through conversations, books and reading posts that will help to flesh out the list of \u2018enabling factors\u2019 for Opencare/citizen led care suggested <a href="/t/id/6429/12">early on in the fellowship</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The skills, forms of awareness, competences, knowledge and practices of individuals</li>\n<li>The designed environment, including public spaces and communal spaces</li>\n<li>Values and a culture of care</li>\n<li>The designed opportunities for interaction, engagement, collaboration</li>\n<li>Commons of all kinds, material sufficiency</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One pattern I\u2019ve noticed is the role that language and assumptions play in either creating or shutting down the interior and exterior spaces within us and between us. Both language and assumptions influence all of the factors listed. The language we use is in direct relationship with our assumptions.  The words we choose can give away the assumptions we are operating from while at the same time shaping our perceptions. In Ivan Illich\u2019s words; \u201cthe present is built on assumptions we haven\u2019t yet found names for.\u201d - they shape our sense of self and others and inform our worldview. They subtly contribute to or degrade the conditions we create. A perspective reinforced by <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/abeba-birhane-cognitive-science-dialogism-and-care/6893">Abeba Birhane\u2019s</a> tweet quoting Bakhtin; \u201cThe deepest layers of our assumptive world are probably those where we unreflectingly conceive the nature of time and space\u201d. Assumptions are the hidden architecture but they impact the world around us in ways that are very real.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/00945b05c075888e5fa0b30e71c21f9886f8e59c" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/0/00945b05c075888e5fa0b30e71c21f9886f8e59c.png" class="lightbox" title="abeba.png"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/00945b05c075888e5fa0b30e71c21f9886f8e59c_1_345x268.png" width="345" height="268"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">abeba.png</span><span class="informations">691x527 469 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>In the Right to Useful Unemployment, Illich describes \u201clanguage as the most fundamental of commons\u201d \u2013 a commons that perhaps requires more of our attention. Like other commons many terms and words have themselves become enclosed or hijacked; \u2018innovation\u2019, \u2018resilience\u2019 and \u2018empowerment\u2019 are all cases in point. There are many more we could list that have been co-opted for certain agendas. Some words are simply \u2018hollowed out\u2019 \u2013 words that through mis-use and over extraction lose value and meaning.</p>\n\n<p>Within the care sector, language subtly defines relationships and power. To reference Illich again; \u201clanguage is about the organisation of power\u201d. Language use informs relationships that either confer agency or create dependency. Perhaps our use of language is the first condition that creates either \u2018power with\u2019 or \u2018power over\u2019 - something to consider in our care services? </p>\n\n<p>There are clear possibilities that could arise from working consciously with these factors. I\u2019d be curious to hear from others who have intentionally worked with the soft structures that shape our world. My hunch is that this could dramatically increase the scope for radically innovative work that isn\u2019t merely badging new developments with a hollowed out word.</p>', u'post_id': 35561, u'user_id': 3613, u'timestamp': u'2017-09-05 18:11:30', u'title': u'Fellowship Post 3: hidden structures of language and assumption'}, {u'content': u"<p>please point me to the best item to 'share' about everything in facebook (both for my personal one, and at Hackuarium)!  will look for a program summary...<br>Also, please let me know if there is something special I can do!</p>", u'post_id': 35894, u'user_id': 3704, u'timestamp': u'2017-09-10 09:03:06', u'title': u'Which links are best to post externally?'}, {u'content': u'<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/c5ee72d4618ab57bb41a20bd8fc847cadede8da7" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c5ee72d4618ab57bb41a20bd8fc847cadede8da7.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Paola.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c5ee72d4618ab57bb41a20bd8fc847cadede8da7_1_690x690.jpg" width="690" height="690"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Paola.jpg</span><span class="informations">1458x1458 507 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>I\'m happy to introduce a new edgeryder! Paola will be joining us in Brussels October 19-21. <br>She recently joined Creative Commons as Director of Product Engineering, designing a search engine that supports the organisation to advance culture of openness into social behavior, beyond using the licenses: "I want to build a more usable commons, a more vibrant commons so people can benefit from its openness. This creates a virtuous cycle where people collaborate and are grateful to each other." </p>\n\n<p>Paola is joining a panel at <a>#OpenVillage festival</a>. I asked her to share insights into how she and others who do programming for the greater good can finance work dedicated to solving pressing societal issues. Paola started applying for fellowships in 2014 (she was a Mozilla Open Web Fellow), and developed a personal strategy to get funding. Her experience has to do with training oneself to find out the funders\' perspective and possible adjusting one\'s research to increase the odds to get a project supported. </p>\n\n<p>More about her work: <a href="http://paw.mx/">http://paw.mx/</a></p>\n\n<p>You can hangout with Paola by joining <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/main-session-the-edge-of-funding/6427/12">The Edge of Funding</a> on October 20th!</p>', u'post_id': 35963, u'user_id': 3, u'timestamp': u'2017-09-11 07:27:12', u'title': u'Meet Paola Villarreal at OpenVillage Festival (Creative Commons, technology, justice, \u2026)'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hey all,</p>\n\n<p>Some updates about the ever-evolving program!

As stated before, the general themes of the festival (Open Science, Architectures of Love, and Revolutionary Care) will be woven throughout the festival.  </p>\n\n<p>Day 1 will be an introduction to the general themes, as well as a way to present some theoretical views of care.  This process will allow us to ease into the conversations and the urban game will be a way to loosen our bodies and our minds with each other.  </p>\n\n<p>Day 2 will focus more on the practical.  It will highlight ways that projects have taken the theoretical and developed them into daily practices and infrastructures.  </p>\n\n<p>Day 3 will focus on the visionary.  It will be a combination of introduction to the OpenVillage projects, but also looking at the process of other collectives around creating community.  Overall, we aim for it to be a capstone conversation to the previous two days.  How do we create the structures of care needed in our local worlds while also creating the tangible villages to experiment?  We will use the MENA project as an experimental space to visualize the logistics as well envision the dreams of a new world, a world capable of answering the pressing catastrophe around us.  We hope all participants stay for Day 3 and that you bring your most creative and visionary selves to the process.  We will need all of you to make it work!</p>\n\n<p>As we continue to develop the program, we ask all participants and presenters to have patience with us!  While we want to give everyone the time to present formally, there may be some changes to the formal presentation schedule.  But Day 3 will be left more informal and we desire that folks feel empowered to present their work in small groups.  Also, if you do have work that you feel encouraged to present informally, we hope that it can be included in Day 3.  Lastly, if there are still formal proposals for sessions, please post them on the blog!  It will always be helpful for the larger community to hear about your work and there is no telling how many other projects you can inspire!  We will plan on having a formalized schedule by September 15th.  So please continue sharing and participating.  We hope to see you all in Brussels!  </p>\n\n<p>Festival Curators</p>', u'post_id': 35166, u'user_id': 3367, u'timestamp': u'2017-08-31 22:04:16', u'title': u'Program Updates'}, {u'content': u'<p>Abeba Birhane is researching cognitive science at University College Dublin. She tweets and <a href="https://abebabirhane.wordpress.com/">blogs</a> about embodied cognition and the enactive approach to cognitive science, which is how I came across her work, when Marco shared a link to <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/descartes-was-wrong-a-person-is-a-person-through-other-persons">her post</a> on Aeon. Abeba\u2019s interest in a more relational understanding of personhood and dialogical approaches informed by the likes of Bakhtin, could bring a useful perspective to understanding the enabling conditions for community-led Opencare. While her work is not specific to the field of care, there are clear connections between the field of her research and how we think about a person and the challenges around health that OpenCare is wrestling with. The extent to which our Cartesian mindset goes unquestioned can be seen in the way which our health and social care systems have developed and our responses to solving the big challenges in public health that have faced society. </p>\n\n<p>Abeba interests lie in the problematic conceptions of selfhood that arise from the influence of Descartes on psychology, the modern mind and ways of understanding our place in the world. She draws on Ubuntu and African philosophy for richer conceptions of the self and on the work of Bakhtin. Bakhtin\u2019s study of philosophy led him to develop the concept of dialogism - a concept that went on to influence fields beyond language and communication. European social psychologists have applied Bakhtin\'s work to the study of human social experience, preferring it as a more dynamic alternative to Cartesian dualism. Abeba\u2019s research interests lie in the emerging fields of embodied and enactive cognition, which are similarly finding greater potential in dialogic models of the self. She is researching the ways in which our personhood is "always on the move, is relational and communal\u201d. Sharing these insights may contribute to a sense of what a relational health and social care system might look like. Where patients are no longer treated as self-contained units in need of some form or intervention within conduit models of service delivery and greater health is generated through greater interconnection with others, with community and society.  </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m hoping Abeba will post some thoughts and that conversations will develop that will provide insights as to the assumptions our current care systems are founded on - conversations that may continue as part of the open sessions at the Open Village in October. What happens when we explore and shift our assumptions, when we work consciously with these, beyond designing care interventions and health apps confined by the boundaries those assumptions create?</p>', u'post_id': 35378, u'user_id': 3613, u'timestamp': u'2017-09-04 16:54:55', u'title': u'Abeba Birhane: Cognitive science, dialogism and care?'}, {u'content': u'<p>This is a work in progress idea for the OpenVillage.</p>\n\n<p><span><strong>Big Question:</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>How can Britain and Europe work together, post-Brexit, to provide a humane and safe environment for asylum seekers and refugees across the continent?</strong></p>\n\n<p><span><strong>My background:</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>Worked on the Ground in Calais 2016.

The chaos of the world seems to grow larger, pushing us to further investigate the materiality of autonomy. The growing migrant crisis in Europe, the rise of proto-fascist forces across the world, the election of Trump here in the US. The continual melting of glaciers. The mundanities of crushing debt, the anxiety of our culture, and the everyday loneliness of the city. And for us here at Woodbine, the loss of a dear friend and comrade who was traveling to support the indigenous resistance at Standing Rock.</p>\n\n<p>We don\u2019t bring these up to merely add to the general devastation. But because they are our reality. They exist and to not acknowledge that is to cover ourselves with superficial banalities. The crises that continue to arise are merely symptoms of the disintegration of a way of being in the world that is becoming rapidly untenable. So when we think of care, we must take on the task of being a bridge to a new way of being. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>At Woodbine, we are continuing to develop a path toward health autonomy. We are looking to meld many different modalities of health. \xa0We have been experimenting with different projects and finding ways to build community. We\u2019ve had a garage gym with weekly fitness classes, open hours in our Resource Center, and ongoing public workshops. Our series of \u201cskill shares\u201d, has included subjects from acupuncture to foraging urban medicinal plants, to workshops on first aid and large discussions questioning what communal health really requires. Autonomous mental health infrastructure seems to be the most pressing immediate need of our community. This is a key place we are focusing our energies at the moment. We find that the act of sharing responsibilities, allowing for new innovation, and practicing vulnerability with our comrades are the first steps to addressing these larger questions of health and care.</p>\n\n<p>With the proposed health care cuts as well as the general trend our government is taking, we fear that some heightened level of austerity will be upon us. As resources to critical health infrastructure are being threatened, as evidenced by Planned Parenthood cuts, the war on women\u2019s health, and the potentials for immigration officials to use health institutions as a screening tool, we are increasingly seeing a need to provide clinical as well as educational resources. Because of the immense cost and regulatory difficulty of providing clinical care in NYC, we need to seek and develop work-arounds. As we see the needs increasing, cuts being made and draconian measures to make non-violent actions to protect water punishable with prison sentences, we can only imagine a future where care for ourselves and our fellows will become increasingly criminalized. Therefore the steps we make to gain and share skills and develop subterranean practices of care can return some of the agency we\u2019ve lost to the professionalization of medicine and the profitable mystery that is our bodies. As we think about expanding our capacity, we don\u2019t want to just \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d of public health infrastructure. We need to slowly break our dependence on these institutions in all the ways that we can and also look for ways to use them to our advantage. We think this happens through sharing knowledge and skills, an emphasis on preventative care, and finding ways to manipulate existing structures to allow us to move forward on this path of autonomy. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>We believe in the utter necessity of revolution, of the development of material lines of power. Questions of care and health autonomy are pivotal to that progression. \xa0From the Greek solidarity clinics to the Zapatistas \u201chealthcare from below\u201d to Black Panther Clinics and GynPunks, there is inspiration for this path all around us. \xa0We begin by finding each other. \xa0</p>\n\n<p><a href="/t/introducing-openvillage-festival/36"></a></p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284.png" class="lightbox" title="banner_0.png"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284_1_690x85.png" width="690" height="85"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">banner_0.png</span><span class="informations">728x90 28.5 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p></p>', u'post_id': 6376, u'user_id': 3367, u'timestamp': u'2017-06-02 14:06:13', u'title': u'Health Autonomy at the End of the World'}, {u'content': u'<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/4f3110c7314608c3dc73464abfce82caf6346b0b" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4f3110c7314608c3dc73464abfce82caf6346b0b.jpg" class="lightbox" title="IMG_20170817_113322338.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/4f3110c7314608c3dc73464abfce82caf6346b0b_1_690x517.jpg" width="690" height="517"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">IMG_20170817_113322338.jpg</span><span class="informations">2592x1944 832 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>In August we synthesized strategic work we have done in ReaGent and Ekoli in July, we are taking some important steps with Open Insulin and we are moving into the next phase with the OpenVillage Festival. </p>\n\n<h1>Strategy</h1>\n\n<p>July was an instructive month for the teams at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ReaGentBiolab/">ReaGent</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EkoliBE/">Ekoli</a>, the two nonprofits that share the open biolab in Ghent. We held three strategic sessions (one for Ekoli and two for ReaGent), to determine our focus points for the coming year(s). We had been building plenty of science related content, activities and infrastructure since we started (2 years ago for ReaGent, just short of 1 year for Ekoli). We had been mainly acting on gut feel so far, but the time had come to evaluate and improve our actions. </p>\n\n<p>Several factors are the base of this: our rent will increase, we are growing and some aspects are professionalizing. The latter is particularly challenging in an environment where the people who need help the most, don\u2019t have financial means, and there is a mix of volunteer and paid work.</p>\n\n<p>I invited Filip Dani\xebls, a systems thinker and visualizer, to join us during the sessions and help make sense of the complexity we\u2019ve created in sharing resources between two organisations.</p>\n\n<p>From the sessions we\u2019ve learned that we\u2019re doing quite okay and are very aligned in terms of values. We did lack some collective vision and the practical details of implementation were not always aligned. Discussion on the latter topic ironed out the details and got us going on the right track again.</p>\n\n<p>We had to think more economically than before. The costs to cover are substantial. Luckily, we have built so much content and expertise that can be exchanged for money somehow. The difficulty lies in the short term that it has to succeed, and the dependency on personal investment of a few people. Yet after simulations, it\u2019s looking feasible. It is tempting to draw conclusions about how to really, and resiliently run a community space like ours, but I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s time yet.</p>\n\n<p>Are there general takeaways for other projects? Can we generalize what we observed with our projects? Not so much. Doing these sessions is the most important takeaway. So is looking from different angles and thinking from the perspective of an ecosystem, rather than an individual project. </p>\n\n<p>In the sessions for ReaGent, what is an advantage for Ekoli was considered a benefit for ReaGent and vice versa. It is interesting how dependencies and assistance evolve over time. Ekoli used to be dependent on ReaGent, but now it is evolving to be an equal relationship, or over slightly the other way around when it comes to paying the rent. This is sure to change in the future.</p>\n\n<p>What makes us able to do collaborate like this? Is it the fact that a big part of the team is active in both organisations? Is it the shared values? The shared space? Something else? I\u2019m not sure at this point, though the first point is probably the biggest factor. I\u2019m looking forward to future developments, where both organisations keep co-evolving through whatever ties them together. There are plans to formalize the link, as well as the links with other organisations that are heavily involved as our partners.</p>\n\n<h1>Open Insulin</h1>\n\n<p>Open Insulin powers on. Good progress is being made in Oakland and we have also started lab work in Ghent.</p>\n\n<p>It is still clear that more time and effort by more people is needed, and that we need to invest in the habits and digital infrastructure to make it possible. Hence my trip to Oakland will be important to implement the digital infrastructure, and I\u2019ve been in touch with several team members there to prepare that. </p>\n\n<p>There is a computational dimension of the project that is also very promising. It will involve the sharing and processing of scientific data by citizens all over the world, much like the celebrated Hubble telescope citizen science project. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m planning to travel to Cork to meet the team there in November, as they are starting their own Open Insulin efforts. With four groups globally, it is important to be on the same page and invest in synergies early on.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/bf1224f479e188198f0b4238571e09e4419cdc40" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bf1224f479e188198f0b4238571e09e4419cdc40.jpg" class="lightbox" title="21057226_10212093020235032_1178840773_o (1).jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bf1224f479e188198f0b4238571e09e4419cdc40_1_690x517.jpg" width="690" height="517"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">21057226_10212093020235032_1178840773_o (1).jpg</span><span class="informations">2001x1500 174 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>The lab work in Ghent took off, after a long search and waiting period due to logistics and legal constraints.

I think a congratulations and thank you to everyone is in order, for hanging in there since we started a few months ago <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<h1>OpenVillage</h1>\n\n<p>After an intense sprint in early summer, and a quieter period in August, the OpenVillage program is in its final forms and the communication efforts are ready to begin.

It would be great to connect these efforts where it makes sense. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>I\u2019m one of the volunteer organisers of a </span><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Science-Hacking/" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>community of science hackers in Berlin</span></a><span>. Since 2013 we\u2019ve been running a local edition of the hackathon </span><a href="http://berlin.sciencehackday.org/" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>Science Hack Day</span></a><span> which brings together scientists, artists, designers, engineers, developers and other enthusiasts with an open brief to collaborate, ideate and hack together. We\u2019ve grown a really amazing community of passionate and talented interdisciplinary folks and we\u2019d love to be able to develop some more ambitious civic or cultural projects. But we\u2019re already at the limit of what we can achieve as volunteers. It\u2019s a classic Catch 22 volunteer trap \u2013 we need money to buy us more time, but we don\u2019t have enough time to work on finding money. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>THE PROBLEM</span></p>\n\n<p><span>From talking to friends in the wider network of DIY and community-based science projects (many related to issues of care) it seems this is a very common problem. From diybio community labs and bioart collectives, to civic environmental monitoring projects, to patient activism groups, to interdisciplinary science hacking communities \u2014 we all face similar challenges in growing and maintaining ourselves as sustainable civil society initiatives. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>Finding the right balance to sustain a healthy community, share knowledge, and support co-creation is hard. And funding around grassroots citizen science can be particularly challenging, if not unfair: researchers that study us receive more funding than we do ourselves. And, whilst large amounts of public science funding are allocated to \u2018citizen science\u2019 at the both European and National levels, there is very little possibility for non-institutional citizen science communities to access it. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>JOINING FORCES: THE DIY SCIENCE NETWORK</span></p>\n\n<p><span>The </span><a href="https://github.com/DIYScience/DIYScience" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>DIY Science Network</span></a><span> has grown out of a number of conversations around these topics. We exploded into existence last autumn fueled by some rather difficult and inequitable interactions with institutional partners, but are now focussed on channeling our energy into positive action. It is a meta network between DIY science initiatives: part \u2018P2P: sharing best practices\u2019 and part \u2018advocacy for access to public research funding\u2019. So far most of the work we\u2019ve done has been about growing the network and finding our identity. </span></p>\n\n<p><span></span></p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d8b004edf753bd59f197b2c281e6789a37919738.png" width="400" height="225"></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><span>OUR PROGRESS</span></p>\n\n<p><span>We took part in the </span><a href="https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>Mozilla Global Sprint</span></a><span> earlier this month with a focus on the P2P side of the project. However, for now we think the priority should really be to get an advocacy platform up and running as soon as possible in the hope that we might still be able to have some influence on agenda setting for FP9. In the short term we hope soon to secure funding to gather 4-5 European community/project organisers together for a co-design sprint to lay the foundation for the network \u2013 describe our identity, values, mission, begin to craft our advocacy arguments and roadmap next steps \u2013 and build a basic website.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>At #Openvillage, we would like to keep our focus on the advocacy side of the project:</span></p>\n\n<p><span>MAIN CHALLENGE</span></p>\n\n<p><span>How do we encourage funders to support DIY science initiatives now? And, longer term, how can we foster a funding culture that is supportive of non-institutional science?</span></p>\n\n<p><span>QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<span>What kind of funding do we need? (fellowships? core funding? project funding?) and how much?</span><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<span>There is a lot of perceived risk in funding non-institutional projects, especially at the European level where so many stakeholders are involved. How to we allay those fears? What about ethics committees, scientific advisory boards, financial controlling...?</span><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<span>How can the impact of our projects be evaluated?</span><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<span>Does it make sense to work with intermediary organisations (fiscal sponsors) who manage the distribution of smaller funds (Individual DIY science initiatives are not usually looking for EC-scale funding budgets - think \u20ac1000s or \u20ac10 000s rather than \u20ac100 000s or \u20acmillions.), provide training/project co-design, mitigating risk for the funding bodies? </span><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<span>Is public funding even the way to go? E.g. Would be we better off concentrating on changing the culture of science-funding foundations to encourage them to support DIY science?</span> Should we be working on developing our own business models? ...</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>As yet we don\u2019t have a clear idea for a format for #openvillage - it will depend on what stage we are at by the time of the festival.

We use a piece of paper and a smartphone that recognizes the paper and puts on it a 3d object .<br>We will be using this technology to project a small 3d animation with voice that reads the story . the paper we will be using will be the reading books used in school education in tunisia .<br>With animation on the words something like karaoke , the kids will be able to read the stories , learn and have fun.In addition to this , the app will have special animation in words and the stories to suit the needs of special kids , like the dyslexique ones .<br>That was the reading feature , also the app will have a game zone that will help children play to learn basic things like numbers and letters but this time using another technology that helps bring 3d objects in the real word without using the paper , something like pokemon go and lots of other features to help improve the imagination of the children </p>\n\n<p>Now we are a team of four engineers:</p>\n\n<p>Myself, I am a book lover , a game player .

We use a piece of paper and a smartphone that recognizes the paper and puts on it a 3d object .<br>We will be using this technology to project a small 3d animation with voice that reads the story . the paper we will be using will be the reading books used in school education in tunisia .<br>With animation on the words something like karaoke , the kids will be able to read the stories , learn and have fun.In addition to this , the app will have special animation in words and the stories to suit the needs of special kids , like the dyslexique ones .<br>That was the reading feature , also the app will have a game zone that will help children play to learn basic things like numbers and letters but this time using another technology that helps bring 3d objects in the real word without using the paper , something like pokemon go and lots of other features to help improve the imagination of the children </p>\n\n<p>Now we are a team of four engineers:</p>\n\n<p>Myself, I am a book lover , a game player .

Growing up with such disability is not very relevant: looking on others playing, running, jumping, and swimming, while you may not do the same as they do only because of your disability! As I grew up, life for me was getting harder, both public and private places were almost inaccessible and not sufficiently adapted to people with disabilities.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, you could not go wherever you want, barriers are everywhere (in addition to how is the society looking on you). Where you move you find that your disability is not taken into consideration in transportation, in libraries, schools, in municipalities, in banks and even in the street. With a very weak adaption of access to people using crutches, canes, wheelchairs, white canes,  and sign language, people use to spend a long time to find a suitable restaurant or a coffee-shop where you can get in  by themselves, or at least where people can help you with the minimum of difficulties.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, I discovered later that around 13.5% of the population in Tunisia and around 15% of population in all over the world are encountering such issues.  As a disability rights advocate, and a Computer Science Researcher, I was looking for addressing the issue of accessibility since it is a fundamental element towards the social inclusion. Resolving this problem means protecting the dignity, the autonomy and the security of people who have deficiencies and find themselves in a disability situation only because the environment including the society are not considering them.</p>\n\n<p>This has been the main idea of the initiative that I came up with: "HandYwiN\u201d, which is a web based platform, based on crowd-sourcing and geo-localization technologies that determine and rate the level of accessibility and adaptability of the public and private places for people with disabilities and particularly, those who are using wheelchairs. Through this platform, people can rate places around them, in a participatory map, according to official criteria and norms of accessibility. The map shows then to its users the closest and accessible place that they need or they want to go. It determines also if a particular place is accessible and what are its affordances in terms if accessibility</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the platform will promote for places that are handicap friendly, public or private, while the social responsibility is becoming a corner stone in a modern economy and an obligation of all. This is in addition to the fact that by law, accommodation in public and private places to people with disabilities is obligatory. Therefore, in a country where a new democracy is being born, all people should be taken into consideration, including persons with disabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to my Computer Science Masters degree and the funding that I received from the French Institute (Institut Fran\xe7ais) due to my participation in SafiLab program in France during two excellent weeks that I spent in Paris. So that I was able to create a team of 5 members (Arbi Chouikh, Tarek Guelmami, Aymen Masmoudi, Azzen Abidi and Vanessa Adouani) who have developed the beta version of the platform. The platform will be well tested and several updates and improvements will be made relying to the users reviews during the one-month essay period.</p>\n\n<p>I am looking forward to keep fundraising to launch the final version of the platform and turn it into a sustainable social enterprise that contributes on guaranteeing the the wellbeing and the social inclusion of people with disabilities not only in Tunisia, but also in the world. HandYwiN is not only a mapping tool, it is also can be a valuable accessibility referential that compile the Good Practices of giving the possibility to everyone to go to places where is the autonomy, the security and the dignity. It would also alert the authorities about the inaccessible places and be an Advocacy tool.</p>\n\n<p>This was the humble story of Arbi Chouikh, a disability rights advocate and a young social entrepreneur from Tunisia, who expect your awareness, your encouragement and your awareness.</p>\n\n<p>To learn more about the project, please see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HandYwiNCommunity/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/HandYwiNCommunity/</a></p>\n\n<p>Here you find also some interviews about the project:</p>\n\n<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="qcx7Fk9hPqc" data-youtube-title="\u0634\u0627\u0628 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633\u064a \u064a\u062e\u062a\u0631\u0639 \u062a\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0642\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0631\u0648\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u0627\u0639\u062f \u0630\u0648\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0639\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0629" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;start=3"></div>\n\n<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="hr3ZmcODEbU" data-youtube-title="\u0648\u0632\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0624\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u064a\u0643\u0631\u0651\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u062d\u062b \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0634\u0648\u064a\u062e 28 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 2016" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;start=554"></div>\n\n<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="H9ksYMCO8rY" data-youtube-title="\u062a\u0643\u0646\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062c\u064a\u0627 | \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633\u064a \u064a\u0637\u0648\u0631 \u062a\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0642\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0647\u0648\u0627\u062a\u0641 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u062c\u0644 \u062a\u0633\u0647\u064a\u0644 \u062a\u0646\u0642\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0646" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;start=2"></div>\n\n<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="AU4qhryywqY" data-youtube-title="\u062a\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0631|  \u0634\u0627\u0628 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633\u064a \u064a\u0637\u0648\u0631 \u062a\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0642\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0644\u0647\u0648\u0627\u062a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u062a\u0633\u0647\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0646" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;start=5"></div>', u'post_id': 34541, u'user_id': 3772, u'timestamp': u'2017-08-20 10:09:30', u'title': u'HandYwiN: Map to let them go further'}, {u'content': u'<p>In the last post we left you with a form and an invitation to share with us your opinion: the goal was to choose, among the 4 presented proposals, the most suitable sticker to identify the shops involved in open rampette project and the accessible shops in general.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the dialogue with the shopkeepers and the final users what has recurrently emerged is the need for an effective communication.

Hexi Pharma, a major company selling disinfectants to hospitals all over the country was discovered to have diluted their products even 10 times from the labelled concentration, to the point of causing infections of thousands of patients in the system over the last years (news\xa0<a href="http://www.romania-insider.com/disinfectant-fraud-in-romanian-public-hospitals/">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>This is just scratching the surface and confirms deep system fail: (1) underfunding and horrendous infrastructure making large numbers of young doctors leave - to give you an idea, more Romanian doctors are working in other EU countries (&gt;20K) than in Romania (10-13K) (2) the perverse circle of paying under the counter - there is no way out: if you\u2019re not paying as a patient, you risk not being watched over; if you\u2019re a doctor and refuse the \u201cgift\u201d, you show weakness and worry patients; you\u2019re also a threat for colleagues because you\u2019re messing up with their system. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>This post is not a rant about the system, it\'s to share\xa03 stories and how they connect with it as much as we like to escape it. Special thanks to <a class="mention" href="/u/moushira">@Moushira</a> for contributing questions along the way &lt;3</p>\n\n<p><strong>First story:</strong> One of my best friend\u2019s brother was diagnosed with testicular cancer. While being made to wait long hours in Romanian hospital hallways, he felt his morale was going down even before embarking on the painful journey that cancer treatment is. Having Hungarian citizenship as well, they immediately chose a clinic in Budapest (also public) - more quiet, and with greater concern for patients wellbeing, both physical and mental. What struck me the\xa0most is seeing\xa0my friend driving her brother for 6 hours every other week for many months, repeating this in cycles until the disease receded. Her own time, subjecting him to this tiring ride and random\xa0B&amp;Bs\xa0were altogether more desirable choices than putting him through the pains of systemic healthcare.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second story: </strong>While I was growing up, my (then) very young parents took grand-grandma in, who had just moved in from the countryside as she had no one left there. She helped my parents a great deal as they were both working and raising me and my sister. She would cook, take us to the kindergarten, contribute her pension to domestic expenses too, so that, in her words, she would not be too much of a burden on the family. When she fell very ill my grandma (her daughter) took her in, cared for her in ways some would say only professional help should care for a patient, and finally she went.. in a familiar bed. So here you have, like in the <a href="/en/befragung">story</a> reported by <a class="mention" href="/u/honeymk">@HoneyMk</a> family shouldering the full burden of care. You also have, like <a class="mention" href="/u/steelweaver">@steelweaver</a> \xa0mentioned, <a href="/t/community-acupuncture-an-ongoing-mutation/638">humane treatment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward twenty something years, and my widower grandma now, too, lives with my parents. This kind of housing arrangement is common practice, as private home cares cost at least twice\xa0a pension. And while there is perceived duty from children to care for their elderly, I\u2019m convinced this is not the way, I see now\xa0how much\xa0my\xa0big family picture (idealized!) has\xa0changed. It is a solution that comes from the need to avoid alienation coupled with saving costs for both sides. My grandma\u2019s rental apartment provides half a salary more and helps my folks support themselves - up until now, my dad was unemployed for the past 4 years. So this is a barter with love, but with too much daily pressure and more to come - my parents are still young (50yrs old) and my grandma\u2019s health is only getting worse. So it can\u2019t be that a generation later, the solutions are still so archaic. \xa0</p>\n\n<p><b>We make these long term investments in relationships and stand ready to pay our dues when\xa0time\xa0comes - in love, care, financial support, anything that we can. </b></p>\n\n<p><b>What if my friend\'s brother could have waited differently, learning something with\xa0other patients in the first hospital?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>What if my grandma had serious\xa0help in caring for her mother, at home so she could still feel a good daughter? </b></p>\n\n<p><b>What if my parents don\'t have to psychologically prepare for their future where their daughters won\'t be able to care for them (my sis lives abroad, and I have never had a job)?\xa0but maybe\xa0could save a little money at a time and put them in a collective pot, like a trusted\xa0health insurance?\xa0</b></p>\n\n<p><b>What if people would be willing to make proper\xa0care investments?</b></p>\n\n<p>Well, there is one dramatic, yet telling story of\xa0crisis-born solutions (and\xa0effective\xa0partly\xa0because of that).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Third story:</strong>\xa0Starting 2009, Romania became the EU country with the cheapest drugs, which screwed up pricing arrangements - it made providers offer small prices to the state agency purchasing and distributing drugs to medical\xa0institutions; the profit margin was so low that they stopped producing, especially cancer drugs; the regulations were so weak that there was no punishment for breaking contracts. This left hospitals all over with serious shortages of essentially cheap cytostatics. An <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/romanias-underground-cancer-drug-networks/272692/">underground support network</a> was created by young economist Vlad Voiculescu living in Vienna at the time. Vlad was seeing desperate calls for help from home and offered to buy the drugs from pharmacies in Austria and in Hungary, flying them in by himself or through friends, acquaintances and, as the network grew, helpful strangers or tourists. The delivery chain ended up including even taxi drivers as intermediaries dropping off drugs at patients\u2019 homes and picking up the cash. All this was aided by the <a href="http://medicamente-lipsa.ro/">online community platform</a> set up where people would report shortages, and led to strong, media-supported advocacy which eventually improved the supplies.</p>\n\n<p>I would ask Vlad to join and tell us the whole story, but I know he is busy. As of this week he is the newest Romanian Ministry of Health, in a situation where grassroots meets hope for system change.\xa0</p>\n\n<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="HtrmVQMUXnw" data-youtube-title="RETEAUA Trailer subtitrat (THE NETWORK - documentar, regia Claudiu Mitcu - Romania, 2015)" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>', u'post_id': 685, u'user_id': 3, u'timestamp': u'2016-05-26 11:33:29', u'title': u'When do you decide that running from a failed medical system is no longer an option?'}, {u'content': u'<p>During the last years, restaurants have been undergoing a sort of \u201cmaquillage\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>There has been an improvement in variety and design of food and interiors, while services and customers have been standardized to fit a \u201cglamour\u201d experience of dining out.

The experience for those who are sensitive to certain foods should be designed and included in the catering facilities also to promote and facilitate the social life of citizens with allergies. At play there is a power dynamic based on inclusion/exclusion, transforming the theme of allergies into a problem of food rights. Another fundamental theme is the one of identity, since having allergies can not be considered something that is not inherent in daily, relational, personal life. </p>\n\n<p>The solution offered by Allergo K\xec is deployed in the materiality of the physical details of a device (round place card) and symbolism for a guided experience for both the customer and the operator, waiter, chef, etc. This leads to rethink the experience by overcoming the lack of information and knowledge by integrating it with the round place card that has the most comprehensive and complex representation in the classification and <em>ad hoc</em> symbols of allergies.</p>', u'post_id': 33838, u'user_id': 3310, u'timestamp': u'2017-07-31 10:57:30', u'title': u'Allergies challenging restaurants by open design'}, {u'content': u'<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/4bc415a68abfd6db99cc6439ee235371d88fc69e" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4bc415a68abfd6db99cc6439ee235371d88fc69e.jpg" class="lightbox" title="honey-POSTS2.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/4bc415a68abfd6db99cc6439ee235371d88fc69e_1_690x83.jpg" width="690" height="83"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">honey-POSTS2.jpg</span><span class="informations">1664x202 115 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p><p>The last four weeks seem a bit of a blur and I\u2019m still making sense of the conversations that took place in relation to the <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/theme-session-proposal-architectures-of-love-policy-vs-culture-in-creating-the-conditions-for-opencare/6271">theme</a>  I curate.

I will give these more attention in the coming months.</p><br>GalGael, the organisation I work with, crossed something of a milestone this month. Since <a class="mention" href="/u/markomanka">@markomanka</a> suggested I write more about our work, I thought this would make an appropriate focus for this post. Not least because it\u2019s my observations within the context of my work with GalGael that led me to propose a theme for the Open Village festival - to explore what conditions generate health, and how this shapes our understanding of the role of citizens, policy and the state?\n\n<p>A little over twenty years ago, GalGael received a letter from the tax man - recognising our charitable status. A week ago we held an event to celebrate all we\u2019d learned over the twenty years that have passed since then. Receiving a letter from the taxman, was something of an ironic landmark to celebrate as I\u2019ll explain. As the years have unfolded, we\u2019ve been more confident about sharing our unconventional beginnings. GalGael first constellated around a protest fire in a dark woodland on the edge of one of Glasgow\u2019s housing schemes - Pollok; the first of four such schemes in response to inner city slum conditions. It\u2019s an area that has been shaped by successive waves of regeneration policy, some that have recently been identified as contributing to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jun/10/glasgow-effect-die-young-high-risk-premature-death">\u2018Glasgow effect\u2019</a> - Glaswegians\u2019 higher risk of premature death.</p>\n\n<p>While protesting a motorway that would cut off those in the \u2018scheme\u2019 from parkland, we learned much about how to create community in a difficult space. We had to learn how to create a place of relative safety in the midst of an area of \u2018excess morbidity\u2019. It was an exciting time; edgy and full of possibility. Videos uploaded to Youtube over the years capture some of that. We declared a Free State. We created our own passport, our own stamps, our own university.\n\n</p><p><i>Somehow the symbolic opened up so much possibility that wasn\u2019t there before. Looking back now, perhaps it was our co-creation of an alternative reality that revealed our normal mode of complicity with the set of assumptions and beliefs that comprise the dominant reality or socioeconomic structures of the present day.</i><br></p><p>One of this month\u2019s conversations with Douglas Robertson, a sociology professor at Stirling University brought me to this quote from Bourdieu; \u201c<i>our denial, the source of social alchemy is, like magic, a collective undertaking"</i>. Colin Macleod, my late husband, who spent much of his childhood in Pollok Park escaping the \u2018scheme\u2019, later described the Free State where he set up camp as an \u2018art installation\u2019 and a \u2018leading question\u2019.</p><br><p><br><div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="4x9-Wzzkp1w" data-youtube-title="Given To The People the film (Pollok Free State)" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div><br></p><p><br>Despite all this possibility, we lost the campaign and the motorway was built. But we had no wish to throw away all we\u2019d learned - often through excessive hardships. GalGael was our vehicle to continue working with those hard-won lessons and shift from being about what we didn\u2019t want to what we did want. There was a clear founding intention that this was <i>not</i> about establishing a charity but rather <i>reconvening peoplehood</i> - what it means to be a people. And that for me is why it\u2019s a little ironic that the landmark we celebrated constitutes our recognition as a charity. <i>Peoplehood</i> is fundamentally about relationship, identity and culture - all characteristics that institutions, not even charitable ones demonstrate particularly well (in my book at least). </p><p><br>The problems of institutional responses is a thread I\u2019ve noticed running through a number of the conversations I\u2019ve engaged with these past four weeks. It\u2019s been a very live issue as I\u2019ve observed GalGael developing. There are certain pressures on an organisation as it matures to become \u2018mainstream\u2019 - often that\u2019s how we define success. The challenge I think we\u2019ve partly overcome is how an entity can sustain itself without becoming institutionalised. What Graham Leicester of International Futures Forum refers to in his book <a href="http://www.internationalfuturesforum.com/p/transformative-innovation-guide-to-practice-and-policy">Transformative Innovation</a> as a \u2018creative integrity\u2019 seems to be a more useful description of GalGael as an organisation.<br></p><br><b>Craft, relationship and conditions for health</b><br><p><br>Living in times when we have a myriad of products and services to meet every conceivable need, through GalGael we have witnessed that beyond this people have a greater need - to simply be \u2018needed\u2019 for who they are - to belong. I understand it as people who due to income deprivation cannot consume and acquire status also finding themselves dependent on institutions and statutory services to meet an ever increasing amount of their needs. No longer producing or serving our own needs and those of our families or neighbourhoods creates a devastating vacuum of meaning. This contributes to poor physical and mental health and a profound loss of self - far beyond the \u2018self confidence\u2019 prescribed for the workless by well-meaning professionals. It critically damages Antonovsky\u2019s <a href="http://pagepark.co.uk/news/feeling-good-wellbeing-the-built-environment">sense of coherence </a>that is fundamental to health and that he defines as a person\u2019s situation being comprehensible, manageable and meaningful. My guess is this is an epidemic that stretches into the employed population too.</p><br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/7633ee97d7eefd5671f668b7f2e4dd860c4e9874" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7633ee97d7eefd5671f668b7f2e4dd860c4e9874.jpg" class="lightbox" title="556795_499047316854870_219961137_n.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/7633ee97d7eefd5671f668b7f2e4dd860c4e9874_1_690x460.jpg" width="690" height="460"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">556795_499047316854870_219961137_n.jpg</span><span class="informations">960x640 88.8 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div><br><p>So what does this tell us about the conditions that create health and wellbeing? For us in GalGael, in our workshop craft defines our relationships. It creates a purposeful workspace where you are not objectified as the \u2018service user\u2019 in need of help but an active agent - the focus becomes the object you\u2019re working on, often beautiful or useful, and new forms of identity get bound up in this act of creation. The sense of agency generated through the craft process is immensely important. Grayson Perry said: \u201ccraft is the physical manifestation of \u2018I can change the world\u2019\u201d The craft gestures themselves - chiseling, sawing, hammering - create new neural pathways, working with the brain\u2019s plasticity to erase negative past patterns. But it\u2019s also something about the immediacy of the experience; its embodied; its not abstract that is immensely important. And that you are engaged in producing something where you have a relationship to the end use in ways that is no longer so often the case in our global marketplaces. This is of course particularly true of the boats that slide from workshop to water for both literal and metaphorical journeys. Each stroke of the oar generates not only speed but agency, coherence and meaning as you inhabit the river that otherwise passed you by.</p><br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/d3072d40060d6f0718d739a1eaf4ab90940e3310" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d3072d40060d6f0718d739a1eaf4ab90940e3310.jpg" class="lightbox" title="DSC_0218.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/d3072d40060d6f0718d739a1eaf4ab90940e3310_1_690x460.jpg" width="690" height="460"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">DSC_0218.jpg</span><span class="informations">1152x768 133 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div><br><p><b>Radical monopolies</b></p>Relating where this takes us to the theme of my fellowship - I see relationships as fundamental to creating the conditions for care and DIY welfare. The nature and scale of institutions make them inhospitable to the quality of relationship called for. <a class="mention" href="/u/matteo">@matteo</a> described the problems this causes, as uncovered through the course of <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/enforcing-a-policy-collectively/786/7">Open Rampette</a> - the detachment of legislators can lead to regulations that are hard to enforce because the lack of relationship leads to blindness in the legislation as to the realities of implementation. Quality of relationships also featured strongly in my conversations with <a href="http://www.anthonymccann.com/">Anthony McCann</a> who describes himself as a \u2018thoughtful practitioner\u2019 - suggested by <a class="mention" href="/u/dougald">@dougald</a>  as someone who has been exploring care for some time. Both Anthony and Marco spoke of the problems that have been generated by a welfare system based on a trauma care model. The efficiency of a \u201cconduit model of service\u201d works well for emergencies and disease. The problems arise when this displaces the home care or mutual and self care that used to be common place. Illich refers to this as \u2018radical monopoly\u2019 but it\u2019s also pervasive medicalisation of increasing areas of our health that becomes a problem, no longer the solution - in what Illich describes as the second watershed of modern times in his important book <a href="http://writingcities.com/2015/11/20/ivan-illichs-tr-conviviality/">Tools for Conviviality</a>.<br><p>So to bring this post to some sort of conclusion - quality of relationships are a condition for health. These relationships form the substructure of the architectures of love, to continue with that metaphor. I\u2019ll finish this post with a quote from Eduardo Galeano, the Uruguayan writer, which captures perfectly the kind of relationship that underpins our work at GalGael;</p><br><p><i>\u201cI don\'t believe in charity. I believe in solidarity. Charity is so vertical. It goes from the top to the bottom. Solidarity is horizontal. It respects the other person. I have a lot to learn from other people.\u201d</i></p><br><p>As a parting thought - this quote also captures the implicit power dynamic in our relationships and perhaps this is a further condition for DIY welfare in the context of OpenCare. Either way, I look forward to more insights and learning generated through being in relationship and conversation with others through the course of this fellowship.</p>', u'post_id': 33930, u'user_id': 3613, u'timestamp': u'2017-08-03 12:59:11', u'title': u'Fellowship Post #2: Some reflections'}, {u'content': u'<p><strong>INFRASTRUCTURES FOR AUTONOMY and the dynamic equilibrium of collaboration</strong></p>\n\n<p>A panel session moderated by <a class="mention" href="/u/nicole">@nicole</a> Demby of Woodbine Autonomous Health Centre</p>\n\n<p><strong>OpenVillage, 19-21 October, Brussels</strong></p>\n\n<p>Collaboration is more needed than ever to solve complex problems in care.

Chris has had a pretty unconventional career path that takes in the UK Department of Trade and Industry; market regulation and development as a Director of the International Petroleum Exchange and then a Dot Com entrepreneur in the world of global markets. This path came to an abrupt end when he blew the whistle on oil market shenanigans and since then he has been researching more enlightened - peer-to-peer - approaches to the flawed system he had left.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Collecting business models</strong><br>He says he collects business models like some might collect butterflies. But unlike a butterfly collector - these aren\u2019t pinned down in glass cases. He\u2019s breathed life in to a number of them - prototyping enterprises where there were no existing examples. This has led to ventures as diverse as raising the local pub from the ashes, literally (The Star and Garter in Linlithgow) to producing a short film.</p>\n\n<p>His prototyping of corporate forms and instruments adopts a fractal approach - one foot in the existing and one foot in the possible. He has discovered that complementary solutions may be found via an \u2018adjacent possible\u2019 through a process of testing agreements and structures. The word \u2018agreement\u2019 comes up a lot in Chris\u2019 chat. </p>\n\n<p>I was hearing, that to make it as a prized corporate structure in Chris\u2019 collection, it would need to be simple, flexible, have an element of being scalable without encountering conflicts of interest and be founded on agreements. And perhaps most prized of all - created a structural alignment of all interests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practical applications and prototyping</strong><br>He\'s tried a simple structure, an Unincorporated Association, based on a two-page governance document - this was instrumental in regenerating the much-loved local pub.</p>\n\n<p>He appreciates the infinite flexibility of a Company Limited by Guarantee (CLG) for asset holding and use. But perhaps, if I understood correctly, it is a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) that possesses most of the sought-after characteristics for bringing people together to develop assets to be held in perpetuity and in common within a CLG. </p>\n\n<p>The development structure he calls a \'Capital Partnership\' produced a short film with a launch party in Soho, London from nothing but a concept, a willingness to work together and free capacity. All those involved were members; actors, directors, agreement writers. They weren\u2019t issued ownership shares of \xa31.00. They received \u2018nths\u2019; that is a percentage of the future revenue of the film produced. </p>\n\n<p>This offer wasn\u2019t so acceptable to suppliers of essential equipment such as cameras and lights. So the LLP needed cash. This is where the funding innovation came in. Two capital partners invested the \xa330,000 in cash in return for an agreed percentage of the film\'s revenue <em>if there was any</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aligning interests of all stakeholders</strong><br>Capital <em>partners</em> do not participate in net profits after costs - they simply participate directly - as genuine partners -  in any gross revenue. I think the emphasis here is they were <em>participating</em> - and it was in their interest to participate in ensuring the film was a success. All stakeholders interests were in alignment. This contrasts sharply with both bank debt and with typical venture capital which extracts profits - and where more often than not, it can be more in their interest to screw everyone in the pursuit of those profits. </p>\n\n<p>So while the structure supported the film production, unfortunately this film didn\u2019t have a happy ending. The director (the founder and driving force) had a melt down and left for South Africa and the film was never marketed. But nobody got hurt. No employees got stuffed. Everyone went in to it with their eyes open. Film investors know they only make money on one-in-ten films and they had a genuine tax loss to ease the pain. The LLP hadn\'t contracted with anyone and didn\'t own anything - it was simply a framework or a wrapper that enabled people to come together for the common purpose of creating a potentially productive asset - in this case a film.  </p>\n\n<p>What works for a film would also work for developing or acquiring any type of productive asset - land, buildings, wind turbines and of particular relevant intellectual property such as that produced through Open Care. Its a financing structure that enables the creation of new flows of use value - whether that\u2019s care, rent, production, energy, pizza or beer. </p>\n\n<p>Then he pulled from the pocket of his jacket two sticks. </p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/8/89c3b82408ee3eb83c12dd829d6c1e3461d0ae07.jpg" width="236" height="300"></p>\n\n<p>He told me these were tally sticks - an accounting mechanism that pre-dated double entry bookkeeping. All those counter-intuitive credits and debits!</p>\n\n<p>He said it was a way to record a transaction. </p>\n\n<p>Notches are cut in a stick, and a record made in writing to identify the people and what the notches represent. The stick is then cut into two, with one piece longer than the other. A transaction between two parties may be recorded by splitting this \'tally stick\' into two - with one party retaining the long stick, and the other the short stick.</p>\n\n<p>He told me they were used in two ways. The first was to record a PROOF of payment, also called a <em>memorandum tally</em>. This was like a receipt of past value transfer. The second was more interesting. The second was as a record of a PROMISE and was also called a <em>loan tally</em> which enabled finance to be raised through the exchange of value now against a promise of provision of value later. Naturally this offer of credit required trust that the beneficiary would provide value in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, these tally sticks were used by kings who always needed money (or money\'s worth of goods and services) before taxes or rents were due. The tally sticks enabled a funding mechanism by which rent or tax payers who had spare resources or had created some surplus could pre-pay their taxes - which of course they would only do if they received a discount. </p>\n\n<p>When the agreement to prepay taxes or rents was made the tax/rent payer received a loan tally as a record of the pre-payment . When the time came to pay his taxes or rent he then returned the tally stick promise to Exchequer where it was matched using the notches (and of course the grain of the wood) to the other half of the split tally stick. This cancelled the tax obligation and is the origin of the expression \'tax return\' for our annual accounting with the tax man!</p>\n\n<p>This return of promises also gave rise to the expression \'rate of return\u2019. This represents the rate over time at which the tokens or sticks could be returned to the promissor who issued them. In simple terms - you take the discount (or profit) and divide by time. There\u2019s no compound interest - there\u2019s simply a swap of money\'s worth going on. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Promises and agreements as a funding mechanism</strong><br>So how is this relevant to today? What\u2019s interesting is that anyone can issue these promises or credit instruments. They become a way of funding an asset or an enterprise. There is no permanent dividend. You could sell 5 years of future production, rent or revenues. Unlike interest on a loan, all/both parties share risk and reward. In a bad year the investor/s gets nothing but in a good year they\'ll do well too. What this opens up is a new funding option for anyone without the need for shares. It is simply pre-payment at a discount. </p>\n\n<p>Chris was able to give a couple of good examples of places where this had worked in practice. He told me about a deli in NY State in the U.S. The owner wanted to borrow money for a new pizza oven but conventional forms of capital knocked him back. Then a customer offered to pay in advance for a pizza and this gave him an idea. He issued $10,000 of promises in exchange for $8,000 in cash - pre-payment at a discount - and these $1 Deli promises soon began to circulate as a form of currency which he called DeliDollars.</p>\n\n<p>So it would seem that this suggests that we don\u2019t need money. We need an agreement (there\u2019s that word again) which in this case is some way of keeping score. Beyond that we simply need land or location, intellectual value (know-how, know-who) and design. And a will to work together.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Both Open and Closed</strong><br>Chris went on to explain the agreements we need are neither open or closed. Or perhaps they are <em>both</em> open and closed. He said - as a model for sustaining operations - open doesn\u2019t work because anyone can take your work and quite simply you\u2019ll starve or at least you\'ll struggle to continue your work. Yet, the open source community is a response to \'closed\' or proprietary models where value is extracted by rent-seekers aiming to screw as much as possible from all other stakeholders. Perhaps the ideal are forms or structures that are neither (or both) - like a club which may be both open and closed as dictated by club rules or agreements. Closed because only members may participate: but open because anyone who agrees to the club rules may join.</p>\n\n<p>Club rules begin with aims and extend to members, standards, dispute resolution and so on. But fundamentally a club is a two-way agreement, being interactive and participative so that interests become aligned.</p>\n\n<p>So I could understand how this all worked when there was pizza involved - just! But I couldn\u2019t understand how this model was applicable to future, indirect benefits or outcomes - such as those that arise from social innovation or in the field of citizen science. In this example, Chris explained that the productive asset - which in the case of citizen science is IP - are held by all the stakeholders collectively with someone (typically a founder whose vision the IP was) designated as custodian of the ethics and aims.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the custodian, you have people with rights of use, people who invest in future rights of use and a trusted third party (someone who took care of any conflict resolution, and perhaps holds the money). This model can apply to land, energy and even IP like open source insulin. The rights to open source insulin would be held by a custodian in keeping with the values of open source but not necessarily \u2018open\u2019 to those who operate on exploitative practices. A platform cooperative agreement could then be set up to act as a framework for the creation and use of productive assets. Think of it like a platform for all the stakeholders.</p>\n\n<p>There was a ton of other interesting stuff he said - like the business model created by James Watt. But my brain is still struggling to process this. So perhaps this is enough to chew on for now. </p>\n\n<p>I\'d be interested to hear thoughts from others as to whether this has any interest in relation to the <a href="//edgeryders.eu/t/the-edge-of-funding-sustainability-and-financial-models/6427/4">Edge of Funding</a> session. <a class="mention" href="/u/winnieponcelet">@winnieponcelet</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/noemi">@noemi</a>  Seems it also may relate to the session proposal on <a href="//edgeryders.eu/t/session-proposal-ethics-and-data-protection-in-citizen-science-open-source-projects/6446/4">Ethics &amp; Data Protection</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/markomanka">@markomanka</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/alberto">@alberto</a> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Chris is currently a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Security and Resilience Studies at University College London where his action-based research focuses on a new and complementary generation of networked markets and instruments.

About 60 people below 30 from all 28 countries were attending at the headquarters in Alicante. I had already attended the first workshop last summer.</p>\n\n<p>The discussion fell largely into two categories: how to help vulnerable smaller or starting artists and how to help new entrepreneurs. Despite efforts by the organisation, open alternatives (CC, open source, public domain) were not part of the conversation so much. The generally prevailing mindset is protecting rather than sharing. </p>\n\n<p>Though, the attendees were brimming with energy as they learned about IP and were making plans to set up awareness raising projects in their respective countries. If we can show youngsters to be conscious about the impact IP has on their daily lives, we\u2019re already one step forward.</p>\n\n<p>An advantage of outlier views is that people know the few proponents in their organisation - \u201cOpen Source? Go talk to that guy\u201d. That\u2019s how I got talking to Malcolm Bain, a lawyer, lector and advisor specialised in open source software. On a beach party in Alicante, of all places.</p>\n\n<p>Malcolm seemed happy with how open source software has evolved into a fundamental, albeit relatively invisible, part of our digital lives. He cited how most software is built on top of open source digital infrastructure. And that companies like Microsoft, IBM and Google are <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">big contributors</a> to open source software, contrary to what people might think. Whatever those numbers may mean, this can make an optimist hopeful.</p>\n\n<p>I asked Malcolm about the evolution from open source software to hardware and now wetware. He had not thought of open source biotech and was happily surprised. In his view, from seeing the open source software field mature, you need several basic things in place to develop open source biotech into a meaningful field.</p>\n\n<p>The first are the basic tools you need in order to do biotech. As it stands, there are ample <a href="http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_Lab">open lab hardware projects</a> around, as well as affordable basic instruments like the <a href="http://bento.bio/">Bento Lab</a>. Furthermore, the <a href="https://biobricks.org/">BioBricks Foundation</a> is committed to growing a database of standard synthetic biology parts called \u2018BioBricks\u2019. </p>\n\n<p>Are we at the point where enough people can easily get going? Probably not, although DIYbio labs are helping. Legislation on GMOs (which is not necessarily a bad thing) is another hurdle that prevents people to easily contribute to a project like Open Insulin, as the project revolves around engineering microorganisms. Our own struggles to find a certified lab in Belgium are a testimony of the extra barrier.</p>\n\n<p>Second are people. A critical mass of contributors to biotech fundamentals is needed in order to make real progress, to make the efforts enjoyable and to keep going. A great example of a community driven effort in making biotech accessible is the annual <a href="https://biobricks.org/">iGem</a> contest. And <a href="http://www.diybio.org">DIYbio labs</a> are localised community hubs that play an important role as enablers and breeding grounds for open biology.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, Malcolm mentioned that you need to crowdsource or -fund all the effort being done to get rid of closed off knowledge. As an example, he referred to groups of lawyers systematically fighting patent by patent to open up knowledge for the public. This requires a degree of coordination.</p>\n\n<p>The latter is where most projects are lacking, including Open Insulin. The Oakland group is organised well enough locally to progress, but it\u2019s not resilient and the collaboration does not scale well, locally and internationally. Coordination is expensive in time and/or money. It is where I am investing most of my time at the moment.</p>\n\n<h3>Collaboration frameworks</h3>\n\n<p>A few months ago, when starting Open Insulin, I had predicted that the global collaboration would be autopilot mode due to the clear incentives of sharing information and experience across teams globally. The difficulty would mainly be to keep the local collaboration going. I referred to the overhead costs and energy that goes into putting people and resources together productively.</p>\n\n<p>Reality so far has been the opposite: the international collaboration has proven more difficult than the local one. The main reason is an obstructed flow of information. One of the theoretical advantages of joining a project, rather than starting a new project, is that there is plenty of work to start from. </p>\n\n<p>Yet, if the information is not curated, this can be a hindrance rather than an advantage. In an environment with limited organisation of information, only those involved from the beginning have a good enough overview (from legacy) to have access to all the right information. Anthony from Open Insulin in Oakland mentions in <a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/organizing-the-open-science-behind-open-insulin/826">his OpenVillage session proposal</a> that the latter is a local problem as well.</p>\n\n<p>For us in Belgium, picking up where CCL was at, meant incomplete information and overlay in communication. These delays did have an effect on the morale in the team in Ghent. BioFoundry in Sydney decided to take a whole new approach from scratch, and they are now moving forward with research at a more rapid pace.</p>\n\n<p>In search for solutions, I\u2019ve looked into Aquarium, a lab automation tool in development at the University of Washington, and the Open Science Framework (OSF). On OSF, there are other open, large scale global collaborations such as the <a href="https://osf.io/ezcuj/">Reproducibility Project: Psychology</a> and <a href="https://osf.io/e81xl/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</a>. They can serve as good examples of how to organise similar projects. </p>\n\n<h3>Biohackathon</h3>\n\n<p>On 8 and 9 July, <a href="http://waag.org/en/lab/open-wetlab">Waag Society</a> &amp; <a href="https://digi.bio/">Digi.bio</a> hosted the first Amsterdam biohackathon. It brought together biohackers from the Netherlands and surrounding countries like Belgium &amp; Germany, but even Canada. All in all it was an international bunch, which made it a pleasant biohacking community gathering.</p>\n\n<p>We were there with a Belgian delegation of 5 people, all involved with the Open Insulin project group in Ghent. We came to get to know and play around with the microfluidic chips developed by digi.bio. Microfluidic devices have the potential to accelerate the way biotechnology research is done, and the open source version makes it possible for communities such as biohackerspaces to reap the same benefits.</p>\n\n<p>I was also planning to meet Tom, who is developing <a href="http://cell-free.tech/">cell-free extracts</a>. In essence, this extract allows people to do genetic engineering with the soup that\u2019s inside a bacteria, without the actual living microorganism. Legally, this is big, as working with live microorganisms often means legal &amp; financial barriers. Yet anyone can work legally and simply with cell-free extract.</p>\n\n<p>For Open Insulin, and open source protein engineering in general, this technology offers opportunities. If we can somehow make the potential reality for the open source community, it\'s a solid step towards democratization of scientific research. In other words: plenty to talk about at the hackathon.</p>\n\n<p>When thinking of a collaboration on using cell-free extracts for Open Insulin, we quickly came to the known issue: how do we collaborate efficiently in open.citizen science projects?</p>\n\n<p>We sat down with a few people to discuss &amp; brainstorm. The group came up with a plan outline that we will try to implement over the next months in the hopes it boosts the Open Insulin collaboration. Hopefully, other citizen.open science projects can also benefit from the approach as we test it out.</p>\n\n<h3>Train lecture</h3>\n\n<p>On the train ride back from Amsterdam, I read <a href="https://freerads.org/science-scope-full/">this work</a> on putting science in perspective. Then I read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science">this captivating article</a> on how large publishers rose to power. The system is not conducive of science done primarily for the greater good. It runs on other incentives: those of publishing, patenting and money. What we do as biohackers and with projects like Open Insulin is political, and needed.</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, then Microsoft CEO <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/">Steve Ballmer called Linux \u201ca cancer\u201d</a>. Today, as a mastodont company whose legacy is primarily built on proprietary software, Microsoft is embracing open source more and more. Let\u2019s see where this biotech thing goes.</p>\n\n<p>In the next weeks I continue to study open science collaborations, looking at success factors and guidelines to copy. I\u2019m planning to visit Counter Culture Labs in Oakland, home of the original Open Insulin group, in September to help organise the collaboration.</p>\n\n<p><em>This blogpost has been realised as part of the OpenCare Community Fellowship Program with the support of SCImPULSE Foundation.</em></p>', u'post_id': 33844, u'user_id': 3362, u'timestamp': u'2017-07-31 13:35:49', u'title': u'The onset of open biotech'}, {u'content': u'<p>On july 27th we gathered again with the open rampette community to share the final results of the project. </p>\n\n<p>We presented the final prototypes of the solutions designed around the 2 topics we have been working on, namely \u201cthe call\u201d and  \u201cthe procedure\u201d, moreover while working on the two topics, we realized that there was a third topic emerging \u201cthe communication\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Call</strong><br>Regarding the call we shared with the community the feedbacks we got from the usability testing of the prototype (you can read more about it here).

The collective event was the perfect moment to share what we learned from it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The communication</strong><br>Although the theme partially overlaps the two themes already discussed we decided it had so much importance it required to be treated alone. </p>\n\n<p>The topic addresses some questions we already asked ourselves during the research:<br>How do I recognize if a shop is accessible?<br>How do I know where to find an accessible shop in town?<br>How can Minerva explicit the fact that they are well equipped to welcome dioniso?</p>\n\n<p>We believe that communicating the right message in terms of accessibility  is as important as filing all the paperwork required to be \u201clegal\u201d.<br>In fact, as discussed also during the user test with the doorbell, the very simple sticker we designed gives Dioniso the confidence that he will feel ok pressing that doorbell. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>After presenting the development about the three topics here, we finished our presentation mentioning a couple of global take aways we wanted to share with the community.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inside out: from the details to the global scale</strong><br>Makers usually have this kind of approach; you start making something and than you reflect on the impact that the thing you are making might have and how you can improve your design.<br>Thinking practically in terms of solutions in the beginning of the design process gives you a solid starting point you can use to test your assumption and discuss your ideas from the very beginning.<br>At the same time you are continuously pushed at thinking about how your solution might fit in the context and how it can link to the other pieces of the system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tangible solutions</strong><br>Letting people touch with their hands some prototypes and experience a potential improvement regarding their issues is not just the best way to collect feedbacks; but it is also a super effective way to demonstrate policy makers that things can be changed and improved. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Multiple voices/experiences and new communication channels</strong><br>Along the project we created an environment open to critiques and ideas coming from different perspective. The active participation momentum gave us the opportunity to engage offices and functions of the municipality not directly linked to the project (i.e. ufficio suolo pubblico and urbanistica)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Testing and iterations for an agile policymaking</strong><br>Small iterations, user research, interviews are few elements that guided our design process. While those concepts and tools are well accepted in the world of the industry (in the startup world  as well as in the most robust companies), in the domain of policymaking, regulations, and administration of city they haven\'t been quite discovered yet.<br>We believe that some of the techniques we adopted can be translated in the exciting domain of the city regulatory system. Agile can be applied to policymaking and at WeMake we would be more than happy to open a table with the municipality to understand how.</p>\n\n<aside class="onebox googledocs">\n  <header class="source">\n    <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f6QVy8j10QgRWNNPNUHhIDbbXiB7IR6KoP0n8-OVnaE/pub?start=false&amp;amp;loop=false&amp;amp;delayms=3000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">docs.google.com</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class="onebox-body">\n    <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f6QVy8j10QgRWNNPNUHhIDbbXiB7IR6KoP0n8-OVnaE/pub?start=false&amp;amp;loop=false&amp;amp;delayms=3000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="googledocs-onebox-logo g-slides-logo"></span></a>\n\n<h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f6QVy8j10QgRWNNPNUHhIDbbXiB7IR6KoP0n8-OVnaE/pub?start=false&amp;amp;loop=false&amp;amp;delayms=3000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Incontro 27.07 @LaStecca3</a></h3>\n\n<p>la cura parte dalla tua comunit\xe0 incontro 27.07 - finissage primo round</p>\n\n  </article>\n  <div class="onebox-metadata">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n  <div style="clear: both"></div>\n</aside>\n', u'post_id': 33974, u'user_id': 1003, u'timestamp': u'2017-08-04 13:34:58', u'title': u'Open rampette | first round finissage'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hello open rampette followers!</p>\n\n<p>The last update was about the prototypes selection, now we would like to share with you what\u2019s happened in the last period.</p>\n\n<p>We have been quite busy lately doing what makers do: programming, soldering, 3d printing etc\u2026 we built several doorbell prototypes and an app that let the user perform the call via Bluetooth. </p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/998a1f88fa71ccb69605035a5e4e405380097106" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/9/998a1f88fa71ccb69605035a5e4e405380097106.jpg" class="lightbox" title="20286996_1607216345964223_1898279854011113336_o.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/998a1f88fa71ccb69605035a5e4e405380097106_1_690x599.jpg" width="690" height="599"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">20286996_1607216345964223_1898279854011113336_o.jpg</span><span class="informations">2048x1780 336 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/f2e3cff9952724a77b029a7b71514a8d6034ed93" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f2e3cff9952724a77b029a7b71514a8d6034ed93.jpg" class="lightbox" title="2017-08-04 08.51.20.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f2e3cff9952724a77b029a7b71514a8d6034ed93_1_690x517.jpg" width="690" height="517"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">2017-08-04 08.51.20.jpg</span><span class="informations">1280x960 150 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>From July 19 to July 26 it has been a super intense week, during which we started a new experience with the community. We have got in touch with several shopkeepers based in Isola district in Milan who already have \u201caccessible\u201d shop, and we asked them the availability to take part in the user testing of the prototypes. Once they accepted our proposal, we gave them all the technical information and  we installed in their shops the devices:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The doorbell  with the sticker on it to identifies the project</li>\n<li>The custom device to receive the doorbell call</li>\n<li>Moreover we created a full instruction sheet.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/c30b14acb87b676a8ce474df6ddf7df710f2d372" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c30b14acb87b676a8ce474df6ddf7df710f2d372.png" class="lightbox" title="manual_openrampette.png"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c30b14acb87b676a8ce474df6ddf7df710f2d372_1_690x488.png" width="690" height="488"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">manual_openrampette.png</span><span class="informations">1753x1240 346 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>TESTING THE DOORBELL WITH THE SHOPOWNERS</strong><br>During the week the shop owners and the citizens had the opportunity to test the system proposed and reflect on advantages and the pain points. <br>At the end of the seventh day we interviewed the shopkeepers and about their experience with the new prototype. It was a very precious moment to collect a lot of interesting feedback to better understand what features should be improved and what already works well. In summary, the doorbell was valued quite positively from the shop owners:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The doorbell is easily visible by the street.</li>\n<li>The sticker placed on the doorbell is really clear, it works well to communicate accessibility. Waiting for the implementation of the final products, the shopkeepers are available to place the sticker outside their shop.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>TESTING THE DOORBELL WITH DIONISO</strong><br>On the same day we met one of our Dioniso, he reached us in order to test our solution in two different ways: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Calling the shop through the doorbell.</li>\n<li>Using the app, which notifies him the presence of the accessible shop and allows him to request assistance directly from the smartphone.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In both these cases, the process worked smoothly and Dioniso was pleased to give us his impressions. <br>Generally speaking, the device was appreciated by our Dioniso: He highlighted that the proposed solution is way more effective than the former doorbell:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is more visible. </li>\n<li>It clearly indicates its function.</li>\n<li>And moreover helps in communicating that the shop is ready and willing to put down a ramp if he asks for help</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Dioniso confirmed our assumption regarding the app:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It\'s a functional solution for people with limited movement capabilities of the arms and the others in general.</li>\n<li>It could be useful for shops where the doorbell is badly, or where a big step create an obstacle between Dioniso and the bell itself.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We couldn\u2019t test the app with any user that uses voice commands to control his smartphone, but the test done at the lab using Android Accessibility Features with voice control went very well. We were able to use the app and call for assistance without touching the screen at all <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p><strong>FUTURE IMPROVEMENT</strong><br>The test helped us also realize that some features that seemed very important during the user research were not so relevant in the end. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In every flow we proposed, we stressed the aspect of giving a clear feedback about  the reception of the call for assistance; During the test we realized that it is not that relevant, as people use the bell in the way they are used to and don\u2019t expect it to light up in different ways to highlight different statuses.</li>\n<li>We put a lot of effort in creating a device with a \u201csilent\u201d mode, using just light and vibration, and unfortunately we had just a very little time to work on the fundamental \u201cloud speaker\u201d feature. In the end, we developed a very silent doorbell receiver, that is not really appropriate in most circumstances.</li>\n<li>Since several people expressed during the research that they have shops with several rooms, we thought that creating a portable device could have been the solutions for all. However, a device that you carry around is easy to forget on a remote desk. For the future implementation, we recommend adopting the strategy of having multiple receivers to spread around the shop.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Generally speaking the most important confirmation we had from the prototype was about the importance of effectively communicating the accessibility of the shop. <br>While we really like the doorbell we designed, it could be interesting to try an hybrid and definitely \u201ccheaper\u201d solution using the sticker with an off the shelf wireless doorbell already adopted in many in of the town.</p>', u'post_id': 33952, u'user_id': 3674, u'timestamp': u'2017-08-04 07:04:51', u'title': u'Open rampette / the call / user testing with the prototypes'}, {u'content': u'<p>Next week <strong>Wednesday the 2nd of August @ 7pm</strong> we\'re meeting at the lab where we can do the lab work.

I am a junior doctor in the UK, currently 3 years out of med school, with an MSc in Humanitarian Studies. Coming from an academic angle I am very much aware of the limitations and formalised structures of my knowledge and learning so far. </p>\n\n<p>I am taking a couple of years out of formal training to take part in the wider world of health, healthcare and healthcare delivery. I have recently returned from Belgrade, Serbia supporting an unofficial camp of around 800-1200 migrants, majority Afghan, all male, squatting in the city centre. I teamed up with a creative and passionate trauma nurse practitioner from the states, who had a lot of involvement in the squat clinics in Athens, and together we built a small clinic tent (literally gazebo and tarpaulin) and set about delivering health care to the community. One of the earliest challenges we faced was how to deliver healthcare where there was no infrastructure in place, not even a basic clean, safe and private space to consult or examine patients. In this setting the lack of infrastructure allowed us to be more creative and fluid about the way we delivered healthcare. Challenging the limited view that healthcare intervention revolve solely around the quick consolation, examination of patients and distribution of pharmaceuticals. In fact these are the last stages of healthcare and may only be offering a quick fix to a much broader problem. I think it is so important to be a part of the wider community outside of clinic walls. </p>\n\n<p>The second interesting thing for me was the recognition of environmental factors and how significantly they affected peoples health. We had serious problems with poor sanitation and hygiene and the inevitable infestation of scabies and body lice. Tackling these issues wasn\'t about treated their medical symptoms (although hopefully we try to achieve that too), it was about recognising the source of the problem and working out ways to overcome or improve the problems. Work such as this prompts you to talk to different voluntary groups and communities about the work they\'re doing, the infrastructure they\'re building and their impact on the "camp". Bringing a collective ethos to the action and work that everyone was participating in. We also delivered or tried to deliver public health information and education to the community about why they were suffering and how they may be able it help themselves to overcome it (ie. itching and washing). Breaking down the perception that you can solve everything with a pill and encouraging people to recognise the environmental, social and political factors that have an impact on their health. Hoping to encourage peoples independence, knowledge and agency in self care.  </p>\n\n<p>Having spent the majority of my life so far in school, I haven\'t had much opportunity to take part in activist or anarchist action. As a beginner, newby or a novice as yet I can\'t define myself by either of the above. The world at times feels like a dark place, as the planet heats up, the weather fluctuates to greater extremes, there is an increase in natural disasters, war, famine and draught still devastate and kill it is easy to feel overwhelmed. I would love to take part in a community where, despite the heavy dose, cynicism does not prevail. Where in the face of adversity we hope to find some cooperation, creativity,  and compassion. To talk about events, learn develop and evolve my own understanding and hopefully share some of my knowledge, experience and thinking too.</p>', u'post_id': 33523, u'user_id': 3756, u'timestamp': u'2017-07-24 11:52:21', u'title': u'An introductory hello, delivering healthcare in the absence of infrastructure'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hello, new update from the open rampette project - the procedure!</p>\n\n<p>We left with user research results during the last episode (link). Insights that were useful for the team at WeMake to start prototyping a new interface, a digital tool to make the regulation procedure more intuitive, easier to fill out, faster, pain and frustration-free.</p>\n\n<p>In order to guarantee accessibility, cross-compatibility and to enable easy iterations and future implementation we decided to prototype a tool in the form of a web app.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/cb9ab675aa829a3252d66680a6cd15bff0f44492" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cb9ab675aa829a3252d66680a6cd15bff0f44492.jpg" class="lightbox" title="prototipo-mockup.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/cb9ab675aa829a3252d66680a6cd15bff0f44492_1_521x500.jpg" width="521" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">prototipo-mockup.jpg</span><span class="informations">1478x1417 474 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>Here are the key factors that led us to designing a tool that was user driven instead of bureaucracy driven:</p>\n\n<p><em>Complexity</em></p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s very common for bureaucratic procedures to be designed in a way that first off satisfies bureaucracy needs. In our case, for instance, the way the information is organized doesn\u2019t really take into considerations the way Minerva (our shop owner) would think about solving the accessibility problem, but it put things into the perspective of solving a bureaucratic issue from the point of view of the person who would review the filled module.</p>\n\n<p>As a consequence, the first thing we did was creating a logic chart of the questions that Minerva would ask herself while approaching the accessibility problem.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/9a613777d0431bccbdada123312b4a7ad8233e1c" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9a613777d0431bccbdada123312b4a7ad8233e1c.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Procedura Data Flow_0.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/9a613777d0431bccbdada123312b4a7ad8233e1c_1_690x228.jpg" width="690" height="228"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Procedura Data Flow_0.jpg</span><span class="informations">2500x828 200 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>The questions that would more easily push Minerva out of the procedure were put upfront. This might sound strange for some of you, as if we are helping shop owners skipping the procedure, but of course this is not what we want... Let\u2019s try to wear Minerva shoes for a sec, would you be happy or frustrated to be notified that there is another procedure for shops that are currently under renovation after the procedure have asked you to measure the sidewalk, the obstacle and you have looked for a ramp online? Something tells me you would be quite frustrated...</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s with this approach that we did our best to guide Minerva exactly to the areas of the procedure that would fit her specific situation and to let her skip all the rest.</p>\n\n<p><em>Comprehension</em></p>\n\n<p>A big issue of the procedure that resulted from user research was technical language.</p>\n\n<p>After reading and re-reading all the documents the approach we have taken in this case is two-folded:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tFirst we wanted to understand and interpret what really was the point of the question and then formulate a new question that would more easily go to that point using a language that would be closer to Minerva\u2019s one</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tSecondly we followed the rule that \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words\u201d and we accompanied text with pictures and illustrations everywhere possible \xa0\xa0\xa0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Assistance</em></p>\n\n<p>In line with the simplification of the procedure\u2019s logic and the restructuring of the data flow, we decided to give the tool the form of a series of questions, just as if Minerva was being interviewed and assisted by an employee of the municipality during the filling of the procedure.</p>\n\n<p><em>Pleasure</em></p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, we wanted to give the interface a fresh but very simple look.

It is a sign of prestige for the shop exhibiting it (like the tourist guide stickers). <br><strong>WHY?</strong> It is impossible to recognise the shop accessible via temporary ramp if no sign is present.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>a doorbell with improved usability:</strong> the custom doorbell has the sticker on it that identifies the project. Dioniso receives a visual feedback when his call is received by Minerva. <br><strong>WHY?</strong> The ad-hoc doorbell highlight the fact that Dioniso is welcomed in the shop.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>a custom device to receive the doorbell call:</strong> Minerva receives a notification on a portable device, which can produce light, vibrate and/or sound. By pressing a button on the device, Minerva can notify Dioniso that the call was received and will shortly go out with the ramp.<br><strong>WHY?</strong> A device with a single feature is more reliable than an app. It can be used by multiple people running the shop.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>a smartphone app to ask for assistance when you are in front of a shop:</strong> A device (fitted with beacon technology) advertises the presence of an accessible shop. Dioniso receives a notification on his smartphone and he can call for assistance if in the range of the shop.<br><strong>WHY?</strong> People with limited arm movement capabilities can use smartphones fitted with ad hoc controllers (e.g. vocal controller).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So now it\u2019s time to develop the final prototypes in order to be ready for the user testing phase!<br>Stay tuned <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 33862, u'user_id': 3767, u'timestamp': u'2017-08-01 11:05:25', u'title': u'Open rampette - THE CALL - selected concepts'}, {u'content': u'<p>Woah, interesting open meeting. Realise you\u2019ve been talking about this for months &amp; I don\u2019t know the web that\u2019s been weaving all this time between you all but my reflections:</p>\n\n<p>Your focus on learning about how to do autonomous healthy caring community through a bold, experiential meeting of people is bang on. Focusing productive engagement at a mobile health village on care, resilience, fitness, mental health, spirituality, communal living\xa0+ space + wild imagination &amp; hacking + radical economics all sounded needed by the many different community ventures and community interventions\xa0that are rising in 2017.\xa0\xa0</p>\n\n<p>It already sounds like a bold invitation to people to join, collaborate and go for it but the questions about the\xa0the precision of the invitation &amp; the precision of the activity feels important. Brought to mind the many excellent social initiatives that fo.am has spawned over the years <a href="https://fo.am/activities/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="https://fo.am/activities/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://fo.am/activities/</a>\xa0and\xa0communicated so clearly.</p>\n\n<p>You asked me about events that I had experience of &amp; I\u2019m not sure I answered that well. But events that combine focused invitation with a mix of supportive structure &amp; improvisation so that people can creatively participate with\xa0purpose work for me.\xa0 Even better events that through the meeting itself prototype &amp; meet a specific question of care: this shifts depending\xa0on the context and where the meeting is.\xa0 If you pivot the whole thing to Morocco - then there\u2019s a different care need\u2026 \xa0</p>\n\n<p>On a Games tip, it made me think of the Brighton Cascade project I set up with Felix <a href="http://cascade.network/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://cascade.network/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://cascade.network/</a> &amp; the unfulfilled plan we never found funding for which was first on our list for what we wanted to do after the COP21 had settled\xa0 which was \u201cCity Game &amp; Action Residency\u201d <a href="http://cascade.network/five/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://cascade.network/five/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://cascade.network/five/</a>. The aim was an action residency &amp; living differently with each other across a number of days on a different economic exchange whist tying it in with a food lab, sleep lab, creative lab open to the public and sharing tools/ knowledge and supported in the spirit of play by a city wide game inviting people into living differently. But you know what it needed to really make it work was one\xa0clearly understood focus.</p>\n\n<p>The reason the cascade.network went dormant is 1. people had jobs &amp; the workshop aims were easier to achieve 2. people wanted leadership &amp; focus to create in reaction too and give it shape - I didn\u2019t recognise that and kept on seeking to accomodate everyone\'s interests &amp; waiting for a consensus which never came 3. (and this is the big one!) it was not clear how, apart from being fun and creative, this would actually actively help the climate situation.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Reflecting on this today I agree with what Nadia said on the call - that a certain state of trust is necessary. To be bold and make the experiment with a leap of faith and make sure to learn from it in an organised way. We never know\xa0where any creative act leads. In a very basic way setting up creative healthy spaces that are emboldening, empowering and give people great information, new ideas and a lived sense of new potentials has an effect that is meaningful, rich, valuable.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>However what I like about Edgeryders is your pragmatic focus on what is actually of communal use and has actual power to change people\u2019s lives for the better. &amp; care is a vital goal. Enacting possibilities with a sense of play towards a focused purpose of enlarging our skills for care &amp; supportive community is\xa0useful.</p>\n\n<p>So a mix of game + pragmatic focus\xa0on care +\xa0working with aspects of real community (whether it\u2019s living together differently, or working with the realities of the wider city / region) inspired me. &amp; using playful techniques in the city - I don\'t personally have time to produce an audio journey but there are more spontaneous acts - like clowning - that don\'t need much prep ie. going out on the streets and giving people gifts.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve got to hand my PHD draft in September &amp; will work out what I can bring to this meeting - workshops or VR project &amp; very open to connect\xa0with Gehan / Bernard / Frank about health / mental health / spritituality / love .\xa0\xa0Available for calls if you need me. I unfortunately don\u2019t have a block of time before the event to build something but perhaps it\u2019s the beginning of a longer journey.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ll be there in October - wherever it is held - and participate with all I got.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 33306, u'user_id': 2754, u'timestamp': u'2017-07-19 18:20:47', u'title': u'Open Village Call 19 July 2017'}, {u'content': u'<p>In the direct continuity of the <a href="/t/community-call-12-7-play-date-with-graphryder/6450">last community call</a>, we propose another seance of online and interactive demo showing <a href="http://graphryder.opencare.cc/" rel="nofollow noopener">GraphRyder</a>, and especially how we use it to visualise what the EdgeRyders\' community (hey, that\'s you!) is talking about, and what we try to extract from all this content.</p>\n\n<p>If you have been unable to follow the last call, no worries, <a class="mention" href="/u/winnieponcelet">@WinniePoncelet</a> has compiled <a href="/t/community-call-12-7-play-date-with-graphryder/6450/2">a series of notes</a> retracing the whole event (while keeping the technical problems on the low, thanks for that!).

This procedure will let a shop owner make an accessible shop in the City of Milan comply with the local government\u2019s building regulations.<br>At the moment the procedure is entirely paper based, not easy to follow and fill. We tried to digitalize the most part of the process so a shop owner would only need a browser to complete the procedure.<br>See this post (<a href="https://edgeryders.eu/t/openrampette-the-procedure-the-prototype/6491">link</a>) if you want to know more about the prototype of the webapp and about the research that led to this solution.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>So what do you do after you create a prototype? You test it!</strong></em><br>On the 12th of July we set up a public meeting were shop owners and other citizens could try and test and give feedback about the prototype.</p>\n\n<p>After introducing the user research results and the reasoning behind the design of the prototype, we set up 3 testing stations, each fitted with a laptop and a member of the team taking notes.<br>We tested with 9 people, half of which were shop owners (our Minervas), one person with mobility impairment (our Dioniso), and other citizens that showed up because interested in the project.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/e6984d51dfa5500c9d7f8978ebc0147d8c22350a" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e6984d51dfa5500c9d7f8978ebc0147d8c22350a.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Usability testing insights PROCEDURA.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e6984d51dfa5500c9d7f8978ebc0147d8c22350a_1_690x388.jpg" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Usability testing insights PROCEDURA.jpg</span><span class="informations">960x540 35.5 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>We decided to run two different kinds of tests depending on the tester:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>UNMODERATED.

This pool of data gave us a starting point to iterate our prototype fixing the architecture and the user interface on one hand, and take note of details that would need to be evaluated and discussed for a possible future re-design of the procedure in its entirety on the other hand.</p>\n\n<p>You can also try the final prototype <a href="https://pr.to/CK6W6O/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> (Italian only) and give us feedback below, thanks!</p>', u'post_id': 33632, u'user_id': 3143, u'timestamp': u'2017-07-27 08:13:11', u'title': u'Openrampette - THE PROCEDURE - usability testing'}, {u'content': u'<p>The ethnographic research at WeMake is finally delivering some first outcomes. <br>The first meeting out of three held place on the 12th july. It was a useful set to present the aim of the research design and the methodology. <br>By my side, I could share the academic background about STS (Science, Technology &amp; Society) and my experience in two different contexts of healthcare (hospital and university). Then, it came the time to present the first insight of the research as experience and explaining how I have started combining and giving meaning to data collected on the field. A matrix about online/offline and design/making practices has been helpful to map the different and many practices enacted by the staff involved in opencare at WeMake. Such practices happen mostly in a hybrid integrated space of physical and digital actions, where applications and software are implied in the pursuit of tasks. Some members of the staff work sometimes remotely and videoconferencing is rather a common practice. Although WeMake workplace is definitely a technological environment, the human element seems still important in finding mistakes or re-schedule and re-arrange things to be done.<br>Interesting questions were asked about the research and the involvement of WeMake in the opencare project.</p>\n\n<p>A second part of the presentation was scheduled about working in groups on the published elements (pictures, sounds and notes). Anyway, a change of the program happened spontaneously given the matter of the meeting: understanding how daily morbid living is being changed in and by WeMake practices. Maker in residence and Openrampette were mentioned as having an important part in the development of the qualitative data of the research given their experimental and participative design parts.</p>\n\n<p>Thereafter, the participants started an interesting discussion about the role of maker spaces in redefining the concept of care in different sets and social worlds. There were two key elements to boost interesting discussion about how roles and rules are felt as costraint not only by patients and laypeople, but by social and healthcare services themselves.</p>', u'post_id': 33580, u'user_id': 3310, u'timestamp': u'2017-07-25 17:58:03', u'title': u'After Fab life event about makers commitments for opencare'}, {u'content': u'<p><strong>Street Nurses (Infirmiers de Rue): How do we help people living in the street for more than 10years?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The non-profit organization Street Nurses was formed in April 2005, following a year and a half of field studies. Two Nurses realized that, despite there being many medical and social organizations in Brussels (Belgium), there were still a great number of homeless people in the Belgian capital. They noticed that personal care and health were major issues for homeless people and were convinced that they could solve these problems.</p>\n\n<p>The organization has three primary goals: field work, trainings and tools.</p>\n\n<p>Field work: Street Nurses takes to the streets to meet patients directly in their environment, without asking for payment. We take care of them, earning their trust, and we motivate them to take charge of their personal care and health by accompanying them to specific care facilities, by actively listening to their needs and giving them advice.</p>\n\n<p>Our work is also based on prevention and the dissemination of health information. We are medical and social intermediaries between, on the one hand, persons who live in an extremely precarious situation and on the other, healthcare professionals and social workers.</p>\n\n<p>The follow-up of patients ends with the integration of the patient in accommodation where he or she is regularly supported by professionals and volunteers of Street Nurses, and a network of social associations.</p>\n\n<p>We aim to assist persons who live in extremely precarious situations by offering them a home and by permanently reintegrating them into society. This medium- to long-term goal is achieved by improving the living conditions and the hygiene of these individuals, as well as their self-esteem.</p>\n\n<p>Trainings: Street Nurses organizes different types of awareness-raising sessions and training courses in French or Dutch on \u2018hygiene and precariousness\u2019 and \u2018basic first aid\u2019.\xa0 These trainings are address to any target group that is likely to come into direct contact with homeless people or that works with people who live at home and have major hygiene issues. Our nurses organize sessions on site \u2013 in schools, in the offices of security guards and social workers, clinics etc.</p>\n\n<p>Tools: Street Nurses develops prevention tools and information packages to raise awareness among homeless persons about the importance of personal care and health, to give them better access to care and to facilitate their medium - to long-term rehabilitation. Certain tools, however, are aimed at raising awareness among the general public about the situation of homeless people. Examples: list of showers in Brussels, map of fountains and free public conveniences, symptoms and interventions in case of hypothermia, Frostbite prevention poster, Heat stroke prevention poster</p>\n\n<p>Since 2005 the non-profit organization Street nurses has grown and its projects are continuously developed. Today, Street Nurses has the equivalent of 13,84 full-time staff members and approximately 60 volunteers.</p>\n\n<p>We saw the call by the Mac Arthur Foundation too, but we tough we were way to small to try and get it so we were very happy to receive the information trough DoucheFLux that this kind of initiative exists. We are mostly organized to search every year for new funds. We try to find the good balance between private, public and foundation funds but because of our high costs of wages it is difficult to fund foundations that are willing to support us. Most of them give only money for material or structural projects, not for day to day tasks, and that is what Street Nurses is all about.</p>\n\n<p>Since a couple of years we opened our work to an even more inclusive service. We have a collaboration going on with Social housing agencies in Brussels to try to give homeless people a decent home at the end. We participate to the program Housing First Brussels.</p>\n\n<p>We have a good network within the association field in Brussels, but when we go to specific funds we are not transcribed in their goals. For example, they help by giving furniture for kids, or funds for kid projects. But our main audience, people living on the street between 8 and 20 years is often forgotten.</p>\n\n<p>Something rather unique in the social field is that we have one of our colleagues that is paid by two different organizations, ours and another non-profit organization. This makes it possible to create a solid bridge between both organizations and have a great information flow. We think there is bright future is this way of work.</p>\n\n<p>Finally we organize a colloquium the 20<sup>th</sup> of October in Brussels that has as goal to eradicate homelessness in Brussels for ever. With the mindset: if even we can find homes for the most difficult audience, you can too! We want to share our experience in the field. It takes time and dedication for each of our people to do the whole process, from getting the confidence, to willing to have a stable home. But we want to show that the hard work also has direct results, and if we rally our forces we can go for a total abolishment of homelessness in Brussels!</p>', u'post_id': 767, u'user_id': 3440, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-28 11:07:52', u'title': u"Street Nurses: get off the street, it's possible!"}, {u'content': u'<p>These days edgeryders will be moving onto a new platform using discourse (exact date tbc).</p>\n\n<p>For #OpenVillage Festival, this means we lose this minisite we set up with festival information aggregated in one place:</p>\n\n<p>We need help setting up a website whose main goal is to <strong>communicate effectively about the event to the people who registered and newcomers</strong> - visually attractive and containing the most important and up to date information.

In the United States a 16 year old boy who couldn\'t afford braces just went ahead and<a href="http://amosdudley.com/weblog/Ortho"> 3-d printed his own orthodontics</a>. In another part of the world a concerned parent got tired of the constant worrying about whether their diabetic four year old son\'s blood sugar levels are ok, so they <a>hacked the diabetes monitor\'s software code and wrote a simple program that transmitted the monitoring data to an online spreadsheet he could view on a Web browser or mobile phone</a>. Their actions are now part of an  entire open source ecosystem, from sensors to apps to insulin, emerging from patients. Many people living their dreams together are changing their corner of the world, one small intiative at a time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In this challenge we conduct research to discover what is already out there and what is needed by existing projects/places/products/services and the people they serve.</strong> In doing this collaboratively we increase our collective knowledge. We also encourage peers to acknowledge one another\'s good work and build on it, rather than waste resources duplicating or competing with existing initatives. The focus of our research efforts in the context of OpenCare are initiatives that exist at the intersections of care, communities and open science and technologies that allow anyone to make and modify the things they want...without needing permission.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do we mean by OpenCare?</strong> Seen from here the definition of Care is nurturing interactions between humans; the open part is about fluidity in the roles and relationships of the humans involved. Food cultures, cultural practices, the artefacts we use and the ways in which we use them etc; the field is broad and you are free to look in whatever direction that engages you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Challenge: </strong>Produce case studies on existing initiatives, interventions, products, or services that are relevant to your care-related challenge or question.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to complete this challenge:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Identify interesting or relevang Groups, Projects, Places, Products, Technologies, Tools, Services or Infrastructures.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Interview their protagonists using this <a href="/t/interview-framework-for-case-studies-adventures/4429">interview framework</a>. <em>We recommend you make an extra effort to capture each interview on video so you have footage that you can re-use/remix for later steps if you want (e.g. putting together crowdfunding campaigns).</em><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Map the flow of information, reosurces, attention and trust in the ecosystem of which they are a part.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that either the project faces from its environment, or that the environment faces from the project.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Present your results in a text with visual material..</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Upload your results using the "add my story" button below or email them to noemi@edgeryders.eu</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>What makes a good Case Study?

(work in progress)'}, {u'content': u"<p>Hi, I\u2019m Duana, commonly known as Duey Sol.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m always happy to connect with like-minded people from all over the world, especially those working towards a common goal of making the world (or their small part of it) a better place.</p>\n\n<p>I grew up in the countryside in Ireland with veg, fruit, herb gardens and trees, lots of trees. That was my foundation. I moved to Galway City when I was about 8. I was lucky to go to an alternative 'Educate Together' primary school. They teach people to care about people and planet and to think for themselves. I went to a typical Irish secondary school which I left at 16 to do a horticulture course for two years.</p>\n\n<p>I then took a variety of courses, trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I studied massage for two years and practiced for a while but I took a step back from that. I hope to get back to it one day, I like healing people.</p>\n\n<p>When I was 22 I started volunteering in the Galway Community Circus teaching kids contemporary circus arts (no animals!) and learning skills myself. I taught and learned there for two years. It was so important in my journey; I discovered my first hobby, first sport, my circus freak family and my love of working with children. I'm massively interested in 'Social Circus'. I believe recreation activities, hobbies, and the social and personal development aspects of these are hugely beneficial to people.</p>\n\n<p>For a few years friends and I trained together. We occasionally did circus shows and workshops at festivals and events.</p>\n\n<p>Now we have a performance group in training called Hoopla Troupla. We have performed and done workshops at a number of charity and community events and festivals in Ireland. My favourite disciplines are fire dancing and being a human puppet. I also practice/teach hula hoop and poi. And I dance. A lot. My stage name is Dancing Duey.</p>\n\n<p>I started doing social media work 5 years ago. One of my creations is a facebook group 'House Hunting Galway (for sound people)\u2019, facilitating people to network to find housing and house mates. It\u2019s really important to have a safe space to live with people who suit you. The group grew to 26,000 people and counting. Another facebook group I started is Galway Underground Gigs, which has 6,000 members. I\u2019m always connecting people with the right people, projects and events. Galway is a magic place that draws people here from all over the world, and I get to meet the most inspirational people.</p>\n\n<p>I worked as a youth work assistant for a year and now I\u2019m doing a degree in Business, Enterprise and Community Development. I never thought I'd do third level education, being a more practical, hands-on learner, but this degree is helping me to merge my ideas and skills with community development, enterprise, youth work and circus.</p>\n\n<p>My dream is to create an alcohol-free social and entertainment venue in Galway. Ireland desperately needs alcohol-free spaces. An inclusive space for people to come together with music, dancing and activities, with rooms for workshops, classes and meetings.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Finally I really want to get back to nature for some grounding and get back to my roots. Taking part in An \xc1it Eile\u2019s pre-unMonastery event, a \u201cRural Reconnaissance\u201d at Cregg Castle reminded me of that. Nature is life.</p>", u'post_id': 808, u'user_id': 3535, u'timestamp': u'2017-01-12 21:19:00', u'title': u'Social, Circus, Community'}, {u'content': u'<p>We\'re meeting again at Timelab this Wednesday July 19th at 8pm.

Anthony and me got in touch with Federico from <a href="https://digi.bio/">digi.bio</a>, who are developing an open source microfluidic device. I\xa0only got to writing a summary of the conversation now.</p>\n\n<p>It boils down to this.\xa0There is someone in CCL planning to generate a bunch of genetic sequences that could be potentially interesting as linkers for bringing the insulin A and B chain together more effectively. Hopefully this would result in many viable options, that have to be tested in lab experiments.</p>\n\n<p>Testing many options would be very resource intensive, and this is where the microfluidics chips come in. A small demo at one of the Digi.bio events can be found <a href="https://digi.bio/2016/01/frogger-in-droplets/">here</a>\xa0(cool video!). If optimized, the chips would allow for much cheaper and automated testing of the generated sequences.</p>\n\n<p>The optimization part is something that we could work on\xa0here in Belgium. Federico is based in China/Amsterdam, so he is around close enough to help us get started and betatest his chip. This would give a new dimension to replicating the work previously done by CCL, if we could test culturing the bacteria on the chips.

The concept of \u201dgenomic integrity\u201d is supposed to be a dynamic big picture concept, not simply about DNA sequence, but all the molecular genetic details of cells. Protection of genomic integrity can also be thought of as behavioral. For instance, we know that sunlight affects DNA; so if you avoid it, it\u2019s easier to reduce the risk of melanoma\u201d. </em></p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" href="/u/rachel">@Rachel</a> joined edgeryders after meeting Winnie at the <a href="/t/learning-about-sustainable-biohackerspaces-at-biofabbing-convergence-2017/6287" target="_blank">Biofabbing</a> convergence at CERN earlier in spring. She\u2019s a research scientist with a PhD in microbiology (UW, Seattle, USA) and one of the Co-Presidents at Hackuarium, an open biolab hosted by UniverCit\xe9, a \'hub of innovation\u2019 in Renens, Switzerland, including a MakerSpace, FabLab and co-working space.</p>\n\n<p>At #OpenVillage, Rachel is hosting a workshop on DIT (do it together) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronucleus_test" target="_blank">micronucleus testing</a>, where participants are paired up to assess their baseline levels of DNA damage and help each other analyse results. She says anyone can participate by collecting cells with toothbrushes, staining and observing them. The bigger challenge is to make sure to count enough cells for statistical analysis (500 to 1000).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What\'s the potential of opensourcing DNA damage tests?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is relevant for health protection. We would understand better how the choices we make influence our health, and risks associated with it. At the very basic level, people who start doing it might think about: \u201chow can I change my lifestyle?\u201d Just like you use a Fitbit app (tracks your physical exercising), you might think: \u201coh, how many micronuclei do I have today?\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>While it is educative, the method has some way to go to be self-contained. The reasons have to do with the complex correlations with lifestyle choices and also data analyses. Another issue is confidentiality - participants would need to provide as much information as they think is relevant for a correlative analysis. But we are still learning what might impact genomic integrity most. For instance, smoking damages DNA directly and prevents its repair, another reason it is most highly-correlated risk factor for both ageing and disease. Not least, taking this testing further also means figuring how to avoid using compounds that might damage the environment themselves. For instance, the methylene blue used to stain cheek cells to see micronuclei might also impact genomic integrity, so should not just be poured down the drain. We are trying to make protocols based on \u2018kitchen sink ingredients\u2019 that will still allow us to do the micronucleus assay and another test for DNA breaks in cells, the comet assay.</p>\n\n<p>Rachel\u2019s workshop is part of the Citizen Science and Open Science track at #OpenVillage.

It\'s quite large as cohousing goes, and while several values are common, there is also much diversity. Some minority groups find a home here: in our case, including vegans. We try to be inter-generational, though there are more older people than younger. That\'s partly due to economic factors.</p>\n\n<p>It is a surprisingly complex little society, and any group like this has its own life, its own character, which would take a long time to describe. For Opencare, I\'d like to focus just on one of the challenges that I see here: how we engage with our own and each other\'s well-being. We have at present no special provision for caring for each other: it happens in some ways at some times, informally.</p>\n\n<p>Sharing some non-mainstream values, and a vision that is not yet shared by the majority of people, there seems to be some kind of assumption that we will provide a safe space for "people like us", a haven from the strain of being minorities who are disregarded, or even criticised, elsewhere. This need for a sense of psychological safety does appear in various ways, sometimes surprisingly. This is often hidden in the rest of society. Otherwise, our needs are probably similar to most people\'s.</p>\n\n<p>We do have methods for dealing with conflict, but the challenge seems to be to get people to engage with them. Recently, a small group of members underwent training in Restorative Circles [https://www.restorativecircles.org/]. If we all understood and participated in this, it might help deal with issues that have surfaced. Relatedly, several members have developed, to differing degrees, along the path of Nonviolent Communication [https://www.cnvc.org/]. If we all interacted with each other following NVC principles, maybe that would be a highly positive influence on our community culture, and the well-being of all of us. But how does one persuade a diverse group of people with different backgrounds and histories to engage in one practice like NVC? What about other practices, like co-counselling?</p>\n\n<p>This brings me to outlining the challenges that I, personally, see for our cohousing group. How do we collectively approach the issue of mental and spiritual well-being, with little common ground to start with? How can we then grow (in) a culture that effectively supports the well-being of individuals, and of the group as a whole? How can we be sure that an individual will receive the care that they need? Can we rely on informal relationships, or should we organise this in some way? Part of our well-being is the sharing of common purpose: how can we frame and agree our common purposes, from members whose values diverge? Are we fixed with the vision of the founders, or can we (and do we want to) move on?</p>\n\n<p>These are hard questions to answer, but I have the sense that we will need to answer them more and more, if we are to develop the resilience that we will need as mainstream politics and economics unravel. We need now to care for each other\'s resources of time, energy and good will, and as we age, we will increasingly need to look after our health and strength if we are to achieve what we want to achieve, being a positive transformative influence in the world.</p>', u'post_id': 830, u'user_id': 200, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-06 08:26:44', u'title': u'How to share care in a living community'}, {u'content': u'<p>Je pense ne pas \xeatre le seul, en disant qu\u2019une fois tous les x-temps dans le milieu socioculturel, \xe9v\xe9nementiel ou de l\u2019entrepreneuriat social tu te demandes : pourquoi suis-je en train de mettre toute mon \xe9nergie dans un projet collaboratif quand personnes ne collabore vraiment. Est-ce que je n\u2019arr\xeate pas tout pour faire mon truc dans mon coin, sans les autres, car la seule personne sur qui je peux conter c\u2019est moi ? Une logique peu constructive mais tellement facile qu\u2019elle nous \xe9loigne du vrai probl\xe8me : pourquoi n\u2019apprenons nous pas la culture de la collaboration \xe0 partir du plus jeune \xe2ge ?</p>\n\n<p>Nous l\u2019entendons partout : nous sommes dans une p\xe9riode transitionnelle, qu\u2019elle soit positive (\xe9mergence d\u2019\xe9conomie collaborative, renouveau des mod\xe8les low-tech, cr\xe9ation d\u2019outils num\xe9riques de gestion d\xe9centralis\xe9e, \u2026) ou n\xe9gative (\xe9mergence d\u2019organisations extr\xe9mistes, renouveau des partis populiste-fasciste, cr\xe9ation de tactiques num\xe9rique de propagande,\u2026) nous voyons que l\u2019importance de se retrouver sous un arbre de valeur est d\u2019une grande importance en ce moment. Les outils sont l\xe9gions : Trello pour les fanas de post-it digital en mode collaboration, Slack comme forum organique et le saint graal de la collaboration d\xe9centralis\xe9s : Github. Tous ont une arm\xe9e de fans, mais tous ont le m\xeame probl\xe8me : si il n\u2019y a pas une base de valeurs collaboratives sur quoi travailler, ces outils restent un beau d\xe9cor. C\u2019est comme donner des outils de permaculture \xe0 un fermier industriel : si il ne voit pas que les valeurs partag\xe9es sont un atout majeur, il restera avec ces m\xe9thodes classiques.</p>\n\n<h3>La Culture de la collaboration</h3>\n\n<p>Comme n\u2019importe quelle autre id\xe9e soci\xe9tale, elle devient omnipr\xe9sente quand elle est vue comme une partie de notre \u2018culture\u2019. Mais aucune id\xe9e n\u2019a fait partie de la soci\xe9t\xe9 sans avoir \xe9t\xe9 confectionn\xe9e d\u2019une mani\xe8re ou d\u2019autre. Un premier pas pour aller vers cette \u2018Culture de la collaboration\u2019 est de voir l\u2019information comme un bateau qui doit arriver \xe0 bon port. Ca ne sert \xe0 rien de tenir l\u2019information pour soi, partage la avec la bonne personne, passe les bonnes id\xe9es comme si c\u2019\xe9tait un plateau de charcuterie \xe0 une soir\xe9e raclette. Chaque personne prendra bien soin de choisir l\u2019info qui lui convient le plus.</p>\n\n<p>Car une information qui v\xe9hicule librement aide \xe0 am\xe9liorer le deuxi\xe8me point : Ne perdez plus d\u2019\xe9nergie \xe0 r\xe9inventer la roue mais essayer de contribuer avec des projets d\xe9j\xe0 existant. C\u2019est en ajoutant de nouvelles grilles de lectures, en rentrant dans un projet avec un autre angle ou d\u2019autres informations qu\u2019on apprend beaucoup. Rester dans son enclos n\u2019aide personne, m\xeame si le r\xe9flexe protectionniste se comprend : vous voulez contr\xf4ler votre id\xe9e contre un opportunisme qui pourrait se cacher derri\xe8re chaque recoin. Mais si nous acceptions, comme c\u2019est d\xe9j\xe0 le cas dans les recherches universitaires, d\u2019avoir un syst\xe8me de mentions g\xe9n\xe9rales pour la collaboration de projet, nous devrions avoir moins peur de cet opportunisme.</p>\n\n<h3>Recr\xe9er la membrane de confiance</h3>\n\n<p>Car voil\xe0, le grand probl\xe8me qui se cache derri\xe8re cette peur inn\xe9cessaire de la protection d\u2019information: on \xe0 perdu notre membrane de confiance entre humain. Tout dans notre entourage nous dit de se m\xe9fier de l\u2019autre. Car comme disait ce bon vieux Sartre: L\u2019enfer c\u2019est les autres. Mais si nous relisons la th\xe9orie du Darwinisme social nous voyons que c\u2019est notre aptitude \xe0 collaborer qui \xe0 fait que nous avons surv\xe9cu aux animaux dix fois plus grand que nous, aux p\xe9riodes glaciaire et aux famines.</p>\n\n<p>Pour recr\xe9er cette membrane de confiance nous ne devons pas croire dans \u2018les grand mouvements\u2019, car comme les grandes histoires, elles sont mortes avant d\u2019entrer dans la p\xe9riode post Moderne. Soyons comme Enspiral, un r\xe9seaux de petit groupes. Cr\xe9ons des petits faits, pour r\xe9apprendre \xe0 se faire confiance. On ne doit pas d\xe9crocher la lune, mais simplement savoir aider son voisin. La petite pierre que j\u2019apporte \xe0 cet \xe9difice est de prendre le caf\xe9 chaque matin avec quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre, d\u2019\xe9couter son histoire et de voir ou je peut faire du lien.</p>\n\n<h3>L\u2019ego doit donner place \xe0 l\u2019id\xe9e</h3>\n\n<p>Dans notre soci\xe9t\xe9 contemporaine nous donnons encore et toujours trop de place \xe0 l\u2019ego, qui l\u2019emporte souvent en discussion de l\u2019id\xe9e. Mais voil\xe0 si nous voulons vraiment cr\xe9er une culture de la collaboration nous devons mettre en place des freins \xe0 l\u2019ego. De pouvoir \xeatre fier de l\u2019ajout qu\u2019on a donn\xe9 \xe0 une id\xe9e. Ne plus voir la collaboration comme une simple \xe9conomie du (mauvais) couple, ou chacun donne et qu\u2019on fait les comptes quand \xe7a ne va pas, mais se focaliser sur l\u2019id\xe9e et les valeurs v\xe9hicul\xe9es en commun.</p>\n\n<p>Pour \xe7a la collaboration doit se faire par les faits et non par les mots. Trop souvent la r\xe9union pr\xe9c\xe8de la participation, mais c\u2019est en faisant qu\u2019on apprend plus de la personne, que chaque personne est mise \xe0 nue. Une expression invent\xe9e par Nicolas de OpenFab trouve ici parfait \xe9cho: nous devons cr\xe9er l\u2019atome de FAIRE.</p>\n\n<p>Un prochain pas pourrait \xeatre de redonner dans notre \xe9ducation collective une vraie place \xe0 la collaboration. Pas de travail- en groupe forc\xe9 qui mal organis\xe9 nous prouve que l\u2019enfer c\u2019est vraiment les autres, mais une culture de la collaboration ancr\xe9 dans le syst\xe8me d\u2019\xe9ducation g\xe9n\xe9ral.</p>\n\n<p>Si vous avez des ressources la-dessus je suis preneur.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://getpocket.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftransform.transformativechange.org%2F2011%2F09%2Fcollaboration-sustainable%2F&amp;formCheck=41377e5c3c3c4266c021b3b312a5b7dc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Howard Rheingold | Who Said Collaboration Wasn\u2019t Sustainable</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://getpocket.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Frealitysandwich.com%2F1207%2Fnext_buddha_will_be_a_collective%2F&amp;formCheck=41377e5c3c3c4266c021b3b312a5b7dc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jason Louv |The Next Buddha Will Be a Collective</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://getpocket.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40designforsustainability%2Fcollaboration-and-empathy-as-evolutionary-success-stories-4e7cfd12e5c8%23.61gdpn4qu&amp;formCheck=41377e5c3c3c4266c021b3b312a5b7dc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Daniel Christian Wahl | Collaboration and empathy as evolutionary success stories</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/5-reasons-to-build-a-network-of-small-groups-rather-than-a-mass-movement-of-individuals-46f2ea72b6b2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Enspiral Stories | 5 Reasons to Build a Network of Small Groups, Rather than a Mass Movement of Individuals</a></p>', u'post_id': 33747, u'user_id': 3293, u'timestamp': u'2017-04-26 13:34:28', u'title': u'Cr\xe9ons la culture de la collaboration : pourquoi apprend-on \xe0 se concurrencer et pas \xe0 collaborer?'}, {u'content': u'<p><span>A meeting was held this week at La Stecca, a social hub in Milan, to facilitate users to fill the form for the enhancement of accessibility of the shops by their owners.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>By contrast, the place is shaded by the high buildings of the Vertical forest in the modern, stilish and accessible open area of Piazza Gae Aulenti.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>The designers of WeMake staff could present the state of the art of the project and \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d openrampette was being developed in such peculiar ways.</span></p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/dfc438e12f609a0350cd6a3b38e9fb2744dd8eb2" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dfc438e12f609a0350cd6a3b38e9fb2744dd8eb2.jpg" class="lightbox" title="openrampette 12.07.2017.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/dfc438e12f609a0350cd6a3b38e9fb2744dd8eb2_1_690x315.jpg" width="690" height="315"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">openrampette 12.07.2017.jpg</span><span class="informations">1557x712 166 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><span>To cover all the aspects and to design meeting presentations and activities almost a dozen of people were involved daily for months.</span><span> I could follow on site and online the openrampette growing design.

Last year I organized a series of meetings in Utrecht, The Netherlands. First they were about Free living and money, later they were about freedom and transforming trauma\'s through awareness as I felt a desire to treat a more direct approach about individual transformation. I call these meetings "Circles of openness".\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Some of the meetings were extremely fruitful and transformative. Others were okay and sometimes a bit boring. What determined the quality of the meetings was the openess and willingness to share from an honest and authentic place, and to really be curious to share what feels exciting and challenging to someone. During the meetings where the mayority of the participants was willing to listen and feel into what\'s relevant at that time, there was a magical openness and connection among the group. I truly enjoyed these meetings and they were one of the most beautiful shared moments of my life. What I also enjoyed is the power to transform through awareness. By expressing a doubt or a challenge and openly looking at it, it became possible to take distance from the perspective and let go of it. Also the awareness of the group seemed to stimulate and hold space for sharing these vulnerable perspectives.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>What didn\'t work so well was:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>when people spoke in general terms and theoretically/ hypothetically without really feeling the question.\xa0</p></li>\n<li><p>when people didn\'t really want to be there</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What did work well was:\xa0</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>sharing from your own experience</p></li>\n<li><p>listening and asking questions to explore the perspective</p></li>\n<li><p>holding space: being open to the perspective without taking it personally, listening with from an open space</p></li>\n<li><p>using a talking stick, so one could speak at the time.\xa0</p></li>\n<li><p>a good host and facilitator who\'s comfortable with (almost) everything and ready to set some guidelines, such as: speaking from the heart, speaking from your personal experience, no interuptions and the talking stick.\xa0</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In my experience these circles of openness help build relationships of trust and create a vital space for transformation.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Let me know if you want to find out more. I\'m playing with the idea to organize new "Circles of openness" over the next months.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n\n<p>Warm regards,\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Ewoud</p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" href="/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> you might find this interesting!</p>', u'post_id': 6401, u'user_id': 3643, u'timestamp': u'2017-06-13 14:59:03', u'title': u'Circles of openness'}, {u'content': u'<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/scimpulse.org/foundation/home" rel="nofollow noopener">SCimPulse Foundation</a> and Edgeryders welcomes Winnie Poncelet and Gehan Macleod, Community Curator and<a href="https://sites.google.com/scimpulse.org/foundation/opencare" rel="nofollow noopener"> OpenCare</a> Fellows.

We want to be free from physical want, we want pleasure and connection with those around us, and we want purpose. We want to laugh over good food, to have the time and mental space to enjoy a sunset, to feel good about our children\'s future, to take care of our loved ones and to be taken care of in turn, to relate to the natural world around us. And we must be clear, these desires, in their true, uncommodified and non-exclusionary form, are inherently revolutionary. They cannot be compatible with the dominant capitalist world view that atomizes us, makes us sick in body and mind, and places the luxury of time and wellness out of the reach of the vast majority. </p>\n\n<h3>The question is not why, it is how.

Care models are failing: per capita health care expenditure grows faster than GDP. We need to spend an ever-greater part of our resources just to stay well.

Traditional welfare responses were designed on a household typology which does not exist anymore</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>68% women are at work in Milan (45% is the national average): a virtuous trend, but we have to put effort on work life balance ignored until now</li>\n<br>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Moreover we see a non coordination among different resources: Municipality, Government, Local Public Health Agencies, INPS (National Insurance Contributions).</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s been long time that is clear that the Welfare System answers less and less, and in non suitable way to the new Citizens\u2019 demands for Care, because of a strong decrease of resources but also because the traditional services are organized on standardized services that cannot fit in properly the new needs of citizens.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand we are seeing both in Milan and, at a broader level, thanks to Edgeryders community, the development of many experiences of care that arise from the community, involving new actors and new approaches.</p>\n\n<p>For example in the project OpenCare the City is facing the makers addressing the issue of care with a different and original approach,  proposing a direct engagement of citizens, persons in need in order to design and prototype solutions to some specific Care problems. (see the first prototype, <a href="http://inpe.opencare.cc/">INPE\u2019</a>)</p>\n\n<p>In this new context, the public administration becomes increasingly only ONE of the actors and not the only actor providing care services.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But what is the new role that the PA is called to have? We would like to understand better how to support the common good in the new networks of Care, how to share responsibilities in this new scenario.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In particular we would like to start a fertile dialogue around the definition of a policy-making process that is open to the contributions of relevant local actors:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>How are you / your organisation / project working on care problems replacing or offering services not realized by the City?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>How are you working with new actors and with a different approach on care?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Do you have examples where the public administration\u2019s role was crucial both positively (enabling, encouraging, nurturing innovative projects) and negatively?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Opening a dialogue on this issue is certainly important for us, the City of Milan, but it can also encourage your local government to reflect on its policies and share experiences and knowledge!</p>', u'post_id': 90, u'user_id': -1, u'timestamp': u'2017-07-10 18:33:15', u'title': u'About the Policies of Care category'}, {u'content': u'<h3>Hello, maker!</h3>\n\n<p>Here is where you can apply to opencare\'s Maker In Residence programme.</p>\n\n<p>It is a funded programme to enable creators to boost their project, prototype or concept idea by working on site at <a href="http://wemake.cc/">WeMake</a> in Milan.

Many people in poorer communities or developing countries have no way of getting appropriate treatment for diabetes. This leads to <strong>serious ilnesses</strong> such as blindness, amputations, cardiovascular disease and ultimately coma or death.</p>\n\n<p>There is <strong>no generic insulin</strong> on the market and prices are kept high by patent strategies of the few companies that control the market. We\'re trying to change this by open sourcing the knowledge required to produce insulin.</p>\n\n<p>As an obvious result this would allow production of <strong>cheaper insulin</strong> by generic suppliers. It might also enable <strong>home brewing</strong> of insulin or <strong>local microfactories</strong> in remote areas. Moreover, it can serve as a fertile soil for more open innovation and citizen science in research.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the scope of this project is <strong>narrowly defined</strong>: develop and validate a production method for insulin. Patient testing and further engineering are not on the table before this important milestone.</p>\n\n<p>The original <a href="/t/how-open-insulin-works-to-open-source-science-and-medicine/519">Open Insulin</a> team from Counter Culture Labs started out by attempting to <strong>modify <em>E. Coli</em> bacteria</strong> to produce the precursors of human insulin, which has proven successful. Next steps are purification and turning it into human insulin.</p>\n\n<p>The actual lab work is done locally and the open conversation takes place online.

Various topics: e.g. fashion, steam, philanthropic activity, coding, care</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Mixed revenue stream is important strategy for financial sustainability.</p>\n\n<p>Breathing Games: Interest in the open money.</p>\n\n<p>Optimisation of resources - where are they and who can access them. We have 2 major problems: 1 is the copyright which creates competition between people and doesn\u2019t allow us to innovate; 2 is the economic system which allows appropriation of the resources by the few.</p>\n\n<p>It seems the current monetary system doesn\u2019t provide resources for citizen science. Use local money. When you want to use the machine. Working for a not-for-profit association. Using many skills and volunteer time. We have a game where you can try transaction - based on gift, mutual credit and so on. You can see how much you can create in each system. Copyright &amp; economic system - which values competition and appropriation of resources for a few.

The goal: curate a theme on citizen and open science at the <a href="/t/introducing-openvillage-festival/36">OpenVillage Festival</a> on October 19-21. This series of blogs is an ongoing report.</em></p>\n\n<p>June has been an instructive and productive month. The OpenVillage program is becoming concrete, my own learning is accelerating and the projects I\u2019m involved in are going through a transition phase.</p>\n\n<h3>Shaping a\xa0program</h3>\n\n<p>The OpenVillage program I had in mind when starting my curation task has completely changed and keeps doing so. Well, yes and no. The people and projects come and go, however the questions remain the same. We really are all in the same boat when it comes to the obstacles we face.</p>\n\n<p>Olivier from <a href="http://echopen.org/">echOpen</a>\xa0summed up their issues in a conversation we had. They nicely cover most obstacles:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<strong>How to put everyone together productively without eg. 2 people having to work full time?</strong> Two aspects: community management and information sharing.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<strong>Legal frameworks and patents</strong>. How to make things reusable for everyone regarding regulatory and patent framework?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<strong>Reliability and safety</strong>. How can you ensure that the community with its contributions (the sum of all) are good quality and safe?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<strong>Economic model</strong>. We have no capital, no investors, no shares. We use other channels like foundation money, but this is not sustainable. How do you sustain a project?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>These have been the issues of many open.citizen science projects, including ones I am involved in. Even beyond citizen.open science this is true. On June 28th we had a community call to discuss common threads across the themes at the festival. Focus points will be funding and funding policies and coordination overhead.</p>\n\n<p>There is however another issue that many of us don\u2019t think of immediately. It takes a more long term perspective: funding policy. The DIY Science Network seeks to address this, as separate projects most often don\u2019t have the time, network or expertise to invest. Through conversations with <a href="/u/lucy">Lucy Patterson</a>, two questions emerged:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<strong>How do we encourage funders to support DIY science initiatives now?</strong><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<strong>And, longer term, how can we foster a funding culture that is supportive of non-institutional science?</strong><br>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The DIY Science Network will work on these questions over the summer, at the OpenVillage Festival and hopefully long after that.</p>\n\n<p>These are just some of the sessions that have taken shape in the last weeks. At the moment, the sessions in the theme look like <a href="/t/theme-open-science-and-citizen-science-for-more-inclusive-healthcare/6359">this</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Learning</h3>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, my learning path is gratifying. I\u2019m getting a better feel of the field by talking to a diverse set of people, getting out there at different events and synthesizing what I see and hear in posts like this. For my curation work, it has been important: I ask better questions. While buried in the daily tasks of keeping a project afloat, this would have been impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Another rich learning aspect is my involvement in the Open Insulin project. I experience the dynamics, obstacles and opportunities in a complex citizen science project firsthand, much more explicit than in any project I have done before. The lessons have not fully formed yet, but my initial assumptions have certainly been challenged. I hope to clear this out in the next months and report on it.</p>\n\n<p>Anthony pointed out one of the aspects in a preparation call for his session at OpenVillage. No one in the team has the time to put into organising or documenting information. So with people dropping in and out (especially experts), knowledge gets lost easily. Counter Culture Labs has made efforts in finding a solution, such as involving an organisational expert, yet without lasting effects.</p>\n\n<p>With global collaboration on Open Insulin taking off, this becomes a necessary improvement. Luckily for CCL, it does not cause much trouble within their team. It is a relatively minor obstacle they have at the moment.</p>\n\n<h3>Transition dynamics</h3>\n\n<p>The projects I am involved in (ReaGent, Ekoli &amp; Break it Down) are going through transition phases. This requires us to take a step back and deconstruct what we\u2019re doing. It comes at a good time when I\u2019m doing such in depth work with other, often similar projects for OpenVillage.</p>\n\n<p>We break down many of the processes that we have, eg. logistics for running the lab space as a community, with the purpose of building new ones. This process unearths dynamics that would otherwise be harder to spot for the community, such as the difference between being an open lab and being a shared lab. And then what that means for being an open, shared lab.</p>\n\n<p>Mid June we had a workshop with the ReaGent team to look closer at our strategy and implementation for the shared lab space. It was fruitful and is the first of several sessions this summer across our organisations to get everyone aligned. In our next location, the financial pressure from the rent will be higher. We need to prepare. Set up our business models and synergies between all organisations. Design the next iteration for resilience.</p>\n\n<p>In July I\u2019m attending a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/amsterdam-biohackathon-tickets-35167108769">Biohackathon</a> in Waag in Amsterdam, where I\u2019ll meet many protagonists in citizen.open science &amp; DIYbio. Over the next weeks, we\u2019re also moving into logistic planning for the sessions at the festival and picking up communication efforts.</p>\n\n<p><em>This blogpost has been realised as part of the OpenCare Community Fellowship Program with the support of SCImPULSE Foundation.</em></p>', u'post_id': 6459, u'user_id': 3362, u'timestamp': u'2017-06-30 15:45:52', u'title': u'Curating and learning by doing'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hi all,</p>\n\n<p>some info for the meeting tomorrow.\xa0<a class="mention" href="/u/ritavht">@ritavht</a> has received the plasmid samples (they\'re in her freezer!) + we got the vector maps and <a class="mention" href="/u/flinty">@flinty</a> did work on the protocols.

Given that this involves curating a theme in response to a challenge as huge as welfare system failure across Europe perhaps this was to be expected. It\u2019s a complex issue that demands new insights, new perspectives and where better to draw these from than the web of connections between grassroots engaged activity that is often taking place persistently and having to learn and adapt unendingly - just to sustain itself.</p>\n\n<p>My early encounters with the Edgreryders platform, I\u2019ll be honest, have been confusing. That said there is something in this that reflects the incredible diversity of the members and their contributions. Engaging with this complexity requires a new set of skills and senses. Absorb, stumble, unravel, gather. It is at times frustrating - it\u2019s at odds with standard linear project trajectories and ways of working. So perhaps I\u2019m simply experiencing the necessary pain we all encounter as we grow the inner muscles and capacities to cope with the complexity at the edge of wicked problems. It also feels necessarily a slow process of absorption before I can begin to synthesise and produce.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s unsettling and creates some vulnerability. But in being open to the confusion and discomfort - I\xa0sense I\u2019m creating space for something new. This is my learning. I\u2019m open to being challenged by as well as offering challenges to all I\u2019m encountering - I guess this is a process of\xa0peer validation.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/a9976271d9da5824728bf87f1bfe19a6afd3a40f" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a9976271d9da5824728bf87f1bfe19a6afd3a40f.jpg" class="lightbox" title="wood-rounds_0.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/a9976271d9da5824728bf87f1bfe19a6afd3a40f_1_690x458.jpg" width="690" height="458"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">wood-rounds_0.jpg</span><span class="informations">811x539 151 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>Conversations over the first month have helped to refine the theme from how I\u2019d <a href="/t/theme-session-proposal-architectures-of-love-policy-vs-culture-in-creating-the-conditions-for-opencare/6271">originally</a> outlined it. This <a href="/t/theme-architectures-of-love/6360">now</a> focuses in more on insights from citizen-led responses to illuminate the <strong>enabling factors</strong>\xa0that support our natural impulses as human beings to take care of ourselves and one another. These insights will shape how we understand the kind of conditions that grow and sustain grassroots\xa0care initiatives. They will help to define the \u2018microclimates\u2019 that animate or inhibit this kind of self organised activity. My intention is that this will start to inform how we understand the role of policy in the\xa0more disbursed ecology of care called for in response to\xa0growing health needs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enabling factors</strong></p>\n\n<p>Conversations started to pinpoint some of these\xa0<em>enabling factors</em>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Enspiral\u2019s <a href="https://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/stewarding.html">stewarding circle</a>;</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Network reciprocity, mutuality, shared values;</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Mental and spiritual well being such as that fostered by <a class="mention" href="/u/bernard">@Bernard</a> "<em>Creating situations for healthy experiences that facilitate collaborations\u201d;</em><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Experiences that create sense of self - being in relationship with others and the world - so beautifully captured in this quote from Abiba Birhane; \u201c<em>being happens in the space between the self and the world</em>\u201d in a <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/descartes-was-wrong-a-person-is-a-person-through-other-persons">link</a> shared by\xa0<a class="mention" href="/u/markomanka">@markomanka</a>;</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Simon (<a class="mention" href="/u/asimong">@asimong</a>) suggested a useful categorisation for <em>enabling factors\xa0</em>that I\u2019ve amended slightly using\xa0insights from others:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The skills, awarenesses, competences, knowledge and practices of individuals;</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The designed environment, including public spaces and communal spaces;</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Values and a culture of care;</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The designed opportunities for interaction, engagement, collaboration;</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Commons of all kinds, material sufficiency.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Coming across <a class="mention" href="/u/alex_levene">@Alex_Levene</a>\'s\xa0immense proposal <a href="/t/helping-refugees-an-openvillage-strand/6249">Helping Refugees</a> - the first category connects to one of the discussion points he outlines \u201cPractices for developing cohesion and integration.\u201d It strikes me that the notion of <em>practices</em> seems more useful than\xa0\u2018good practice\u2019, which appears\xa0prescriptive by comparison. Perhaps the idea that <em>p</em><em>ractices</em>\xa0create the conditions for collective action, while <em>good practice</em> is an instrument of policy would be worth further discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Simon makes another interesting point - that these kind of skills are \u201c<a href="/t/theme-session-proposal-architectures-of-love-policy-vs-culture-in-creating-the-conditions-for-opencare/6271/14">not</a> learned, [rather] picked up from living in a culture where they are norms, through a process you could call \u2018enculturation\u2019.\u201d\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The fourth category\xa0connects with what <a href="http://dark-mountain.net/mountaineers/dougie-strang/">Dougie Strang</a> of Dark Mountain referred to during our chat as \u2018deep encounters\u2019 and this is something that I\'m keen to\xa0explore further. How do we facilitate these kind of experiences?\xa0Might this be one mode of Simon\'s \'enculturation\'?\xa0\xa0(This might be worth a separate blog post...)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roles &amp; responsibilities</strong></p>\n\n<p>All interesting insights on which to build. Another\xa0area that is opening up through these conversations starts to re-evaluate\xa0the relationship between citizens and the State. State care responses are dependent on and delivered by institutions designed and built in a different era and on a different world view. Consideration of citizen-led care responses will take us into a process of renegotiating the roles and responsibilities of the citizen and the state.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>A number of threads of\xa0conversation\xa0touched on this issue of responsibility. <a class="mention" href="/u/alberto">@Alberto</a>\xa0referenced the Amish refusal of health insurance on the grounds that it \u2018de-responsibilises\u2019 people. Conversation with <a href="http://wendyball.org/">Wendy Ball</a> explored her recent intervention in a street fight and how \u2018externalising responsibility\u2019 for care creates dependency on state responses -\xa0turning us into passive subjects. This lack of agency can become crippling and is a symptom of how \'de-responsibilised\' we\'ve become.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Early considerations on role of policy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Where policy sits in relation to this also came up in conversation. Simon commented that \u201cmisguided policy can be worse than no policy\u201d\xa0and we agreed that this wasn\u2019t to dismiss the efforts of policymakers altogether. Policy is by its nature \u2018top-down\u2019 and in conversation with <a class="mention" href="/u/luke_devlin">@Luke_Devlin</a> we couldn\u2019t <em>not</em> notice the etymological connection between the words <em>Policy/Police/Politic</em> - <em>polites</em> is citizen, <em>polis</em> is city or state (as well as Glasweigan for police!). But the word policy itself means \u201cway of management\u201d and the discussion is perhaps - what ways of managing the health and social care of citizens are most appropriate given what we now know about how the world works has shifted considerably since the times of ancient Greece or 14th C France. The current mechanics of government need reform if they are to cope with the scale and complexity of current challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Over the coming months and through the Open Village program, more of these conversations and questions will refine an understanding of the enabling factors for OpenCare - drawing largely on the multitude of posts by the Edgeryders community that detail\xa0real life experience and precious lessons learned about what works and what doesn\'t work.\xa0In the process clues will be gathered that start to\xa0deconstruct policy and re-imagine new tools that are more generative in relation to the health and wellbeing of citizens. And beyond this perhaps how we reconfigure the role of the State to re-calibrate responsibility and the role of citizens in ways that create greater agency as a foundation to health.</p>', u'post_id': 6462, u'user_id': 3613, u'timestamp': u'2017-07-01 18:12:01', u'title': u'Fellowship Post #1 - weird conversations and early insights'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hello we are Monica and Nicoletta Allergo K\xec team project.</p>\n\n<p>Together with Alessandro and Costantino, from the WeMake - OpenCare MIR team, we explored the main steps of the Agile Planning, which made us able to focus more on our project.

empathy, a voice, to be listened to, to be believed in, somewhere to go where they will be given hope of a more meaningful life.\u2019</em></p>\n\n<p>Cos\xe1in Community Wellness is a recent\xa0initiative to develop a peer-led community-based support system for people with emotional distress and mental health issues, and to promote wellness for all. Cos\xe1in is the Irish word for \u2018pathways', reflecting our belief in different paths not single roads, and the guidance, wisdom and support that we can find in the stories of each others individual journeys. All quotes within this article are from research performed by Galway Mental Health Services Consumer Panel, the local representative body of mental health service users for the geographic region.</p>\n\n<p>GMHSCP advocates for supports and services which are fit for purpose from the perspective of service users, and the integration of users of services into the design, \xa0development and delivery of services, working in partnership with the Irish Health Services (HSE) based on the value of our lived experience of current systems of care, and the evidence of our own healing processes.</p>\n\n<p><em>\u2018The most effective help I have experienced over the years, having had years of medication, psychotherapy, hospitalisation, is the support of peers, where I am treated as normal, with kindness, not judged, and not expected to conform to the medical model of treatment.\u2019</em></p>\n\n<p>Where progress was slow or absent within the system, we took\xa0it upon ourselves to prototype and demonstrate how necessary supports could be delivered in partnership and collaboration between health providers, community groups, and local authorities based on a cooperative ethos of mutual support. We believe our approach will be of value and benefit because</p>\n\n<p>\u2018it's a community based project concerned with 'well-being' which is preparing fertile ground for the empowerment and transformation of people, individually and as a group. It's organic growth reflects the personalities and desires of the people involved, making it of and for the people.\u2019</p>\n\n<p>Our belief is that properly resourced and equipped communities can provide more effective intervention in cases of crisis,\xa0care in a more person-centred and human manner, and both at a lower cost than the dominant acute-oriented, clinical and biomedical approaches. We believe that only approaches that are grounded in local communities and emerge from their dreams and aspirations\xa0can meet the needs which we are presented with in the time that we have.</p>\n\n<p><em>\u2018My experience of large organisations is that the individual gets lost in the system and become just another number\u2026 I\u2019m sick and tired of waiting for the HSE to offer people the support they want\u2019</em></p>\n\n<p>We also believe that the act of mutual support is amongst the most therapeutic of acts, transforming relationships from ones of being a recipient and subject of care, to a space of\xa0autonomy, collective development, peer provision and mutual reliance that involves people in generating their own solutions.</p>\n\n<p><em>\u2018Being with people who are doing whatever we can to have our lives the way we want them, seeing the evidence that people can succeed, that we can make a difference \u2013 all this has a positive effect on my own mental health, self-esteem and my ability to shape my life the way I want it.\u2019</em></p>\n\n<p><b>We developed our initiative over the course of the Galway 2020 Bid process, using \xa0participatory design exercises that brought together a range of groups and individuals including\xa0independent therapists,\xa0health professionals, service users and patients,\xa0and other interested parties who are seeking to develop new models of community-based health promotion and care.\xa0</b>We then used the blank canvas of a disused city building, visioning and combining elements of artspace, green makerspace, and wellness supports that were brought together using the concept of an\xa0integrated cultural and community hub. During this time we came into contact with EdgeRyders and the Opencare research project, and welcomed the opportunity to form productive partnerships at European level with groups and initiatives with similar ethos.</p>\n\n<p><b>Our current operating model exists with the support of Galway City Museum, who have provided us with the use of a room one day a week for prototyping and co-design. </b>This is taking place as part of the Galway City Cultural Strategy, which seeks to use \xa0cultural resources and infrastructure for wellness supports and public health.\xa0These sessions were an extension of the earlier co-design process, deployed in a real-life environment for feedback from stakeholders and re-design. Our sessions to date have included artistic and creative process, peer support and educational sessions, based on the demand from service users.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Currently delivered on a volunteer basis for proof of concept, our intent is to progress towards a cultural space and \u2018crisis cafe\u2019 on a social enterprise model, with a welcoming cafe-type front-of-house drop-in space that can be used as an open studio and learning space, with a supportive backstage of more intensive interventions, therapies and supports for those people in emotional distress. Our model is grounded in the value and authenticity of provision of supports and services that are delivered by people with the direct personal experience of the situations in question, and the expressed need based on our research for appropriate creative outlets that support emotional wellbeing and generate meaning and community for the participants.</p>\n\n<p><em>\u2018in Irish culture mental health tends to be seen as a failing by an individual, of an individual, in an individual. This attitude views the natural processes of emotional distress and recovery through a lens of pathology, individualised blame, guilt and shame.\xa0In contrast, rather than attempt to seek what Zygmunt Bauman called \u2018individual solutions to collective problems\u2019, an impossible task, we felt the need for the sake of our collective sanity, to use an approach based on collective support and interdependence.</em></p>\n\n<p>Our story is just beginning.</p>", u'post_id': 757, u'user_id': 3067, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-20 15:54:04', u'title': u'Cosain Community Wellness'}, {u'content': u'<p>Makers in residence are supposed to deliver and publish on the web the output of their experience at WeMake.</p>\n\n<p>Finding the right way to record and develop a innovative and open experience seemed therefore a matter of concern in designing the opencare <a href="http://wemake.cc/opencare/maker-in-residence-en/" rel="nofollow noopener">MIR program</a>.</p>\n\n<p>During the last weeks <a href="https://github.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">GitHub</a>, a social network for developers, became a obliged point of passage for some people at WeMake.</p>\n\n<p>Github allows to create repositories, communities and webpages (gh_pages), among the main features.

The role of the Municipality of Milan in the project is fundamental in making all this possible.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISdhijO8RmM" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISdhijO8RmM</a></p>', u'post_id': 874, u'user_id': 3310, u'timestamp': u'2017-06-29 11:47:56', u'title': u'Openrampette full update at Consortium Meeting in Bordeaux'}, {u'content': u'<p>A couple of weeks ago after collecting all the data from the public event of may 11th, we also produced an online questionnaire to better understand the user experience of a Dioniso facing the temporary ramp.</p>\n\n<p>You can<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2SJ8fygbNJmRm12emZuWDhZUDQ/view" rel="nofollow noopener"> download a summary of the responses</a> to the questionnaire\xa0here or look at the raw data <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JGH8jUpBeWaSkAtEdtQix7u9UMl_7kupJYxNcMsEmVk/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></p>\n\n<p>I want to highlight here the most important insights collected:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<strong>How does </strong><strong>Dioniso</strong><strong> </strong><strong>recognise</strong><strong> an accessible shop?</strong><br>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Dioniso mainly focuses on the presence of ramp or the presence of the \u201caccessibility\u201d sticker to recognise an accessible shop.</p>\n\n<p>If none of those is present s/he doesn\u2019t even bother ringing the bell and goes to a different place.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI feel comfortable shopping at the mall, it has no barrier and I can move around freely\u201d Dioniso</p>\n\n<p><strong>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa02.

When ever an adolescent brings up a topic around \xa0reproductive health or sex \xa0education, they are usually severely punished \xa0and regarded as been disrespectful to their elders. Due to this absence of discussion on sex education, many adolescent young girls face lots of challenges and stigma at their puberty stage, especially during menstruation.Most parents in Cameroon especially in the rural and grassroots areas, don\'t know that they have to provide pads for their girl children during menstruation. They don\'t even give their girls advice when these children even summon a little courage to inform them that something abnormal is happening with them .According to many parents, these children are very immature and still very young to be able to handle understand and process issues on puberty , reproductive health and menstruation. Because of this lack of discussion between parents and children on sex education, many of these girls, during menstruation are forced to stay away from school because of stigma from boys who often notice blood stains on their uniforms and also the unpleasant odor which \xa0cames out of the bodies as a result. \xa0Their staying away from school, makes them not to be performant as they ought to be like the boys and this plays a key role for their poor performances. Some stay away for two weeks and others for a month, just to avoid this stigma. As a youth advocate to encourage parent children dialogue on sex education and advoacting for Access to reproductive health knowledge, i have had time to hold some trainings with a few groups of adolescent girls to tell me about their experiences. \xa0As a result of lack of menstrual hygiene, due to absence of \xa0dialogue between them and their parents, \xa0i was amazed by the stories i got. Some said, as they approached their parents \xa0when\xa0they noticed boold stains on their pants, they were thoroughly scolded and driven away and warned never to discuss any thing on menstruation. Some said, they were forced to carry dry dust and sand to\xa0insert into their vaginas in order to stop the bleeding as they knew not what was happening to them. Other stories came up like using \xa0dirty clothes to pad themselves, which was very in hygienic and gave them some genital infections. \xa0As a result of this lack of knowledge on reproductive health for adolescent girls, many have dropped out of school because of unintended pregnancies, some have contracted sexually transmissable infections and others have been forced into early marriages , to the boys that impregnated them. Many of these \xa0adolecents have lost hope for a better future, because they are now in condtions due to necglect and lack of reproductive health knowledge. \xa0so i am hoping to enlightened parents and the community about the importance of sex education and also advocating for this curriculum to be taught in primary and secondary schools in Cameroon. I am hoping, to equally train these adolescent girls on matters of gender equality, menstrual hygiene , family planning and reproductive health as a Whole. In Africa, there is an ardage which says "Charity begins at home" if \xa0discussions between parents and children are initiated at home on sex education, it will go an extra mile to enable parents understand their daughters and support them effectively , so that they will not be statistics of unwanted pregnancies , school drop outs and poor academic performance in school.

When testing the mixture with gelelectrophoresis, they have one band (indication of the presence of a protein) that is the right size (40kDA) for the desired insulin-gfp-protein molecule, which is encouraging. However, they also have a band that is a bit shorter (30kDA).</p>\n\n<p>They've been troubleshooting issues with the purification column. They want to research better ways for production now, so they will revise the construct for a better production process and higher yield. There are two new phd'ers on board who bring some fresh talent.</p>\n\n<p>We (Belgium group) should get good yields of the gfp-insulin molecule a few days after we receive the shipment.

That project outlined the history and present conditions of the Scajaquada River. The river was buried under the city of Buffalo in the 1800\u2019s as a way to keep from dealing with the smell and pollution found in the water. Parts of the river remain buried and it continues to be polluted even as it is monitored by state and federal organizations.\xa0 My research and installation took about three years to put together, and it presented the complexity of how economy, government policies, lack of planning, lack of accessible information and climate change can dramatically erode an environmental and cultural asset while creating insafe health issues to underserved populations.</p>\n\n<p>It was during this installation that I was approached to consider doing a similar project about the Bagmati River that flows though the middle of Kathmandu, Nepal. After initial discussions with professionals, museum staff and community members in Kathmandu, it was clear that there was a great deal of interest in starting a new project investigating the Bagmati River. I was granted a residency at the Kathmandu Contemporary Arts Center a few months later, and my research began in earnest. Jason Dilworth, a colleague at the State University of New York and a graphic designer, joined the venture early in 2016 and his work has been integral to the project\u2019s success. During Jason\u2019s and my first trip to Kathmandu in March of 2016, we were able to strengthen past connections to the project while building a larger network of individuals and groups committed to improving conditions in the Kathmandu Valley and the communities outside the valley who live along the river. Support for the <em>Bagmati River Arts Project</em> has grown steadily from the beginning through the assistance of Hatchfund donors, travel support through SUNY Fredonia and a Burchfield Penney Art Center grant. It has continued to grow through the sales of the project\u2019s publications and the sales of my artwork.</p>\n\n<p><span>The <i>Bagmati River Arts Project</i> (</span><a href="http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/</a>) <span>includes exhibitions, lectures and a website that houses a project\xa0 overview, daily of blog of research in Kathmandu, sketchbooks, data, videos and links to the project\'s publication and documentary:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>an exhibition at the Siddhartha Art Gallery at Barbar Mahal Revisited in Kathmandu opening on November 20th, 2016. My artwork, water data from the Bagmati River and the video documentary will be presented on the second floor. The first will include artwork by Nepalese artists whose attention focuses with issues related to the Bagmati River and related health concerns in the area. We are also working with the fine art faculty and students at Kathmandu University who will be creating work related to their cultural connections to the river.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<a href="http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/project-publication-2/" rel="nofollow noopener">\xa0a book</a> ,<em>Complexities of Water: Bagmati River, Nepal and Beyond</em>, is a publication that will examine how the holiest river in Nepal became spoiled by decades of pollution and policies that did not address issues related to climate change. It\u2019s present condition is a result of is the result of government mismanagement and oversight, lack of concern for underrepresented communities who live along its banks, and extreme flooding and droughts due to climate change. Recent reports have ranked Nepal as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change due to the high rate of urbanization, unchecked industrial development, severely low water supply, high pollution levels, increasingly frequent extreme floods and droughts, predictions of worsening conditions and lack of appropriate planning to mitigate or adapt to these conditions. Reports also list Nepal as an LDC (least developed country), which indicates its potential limitations to address these issues. This project hopes to bring international attention to this issue and hopefully some support to help provide finances to assist in addressing these issues.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 While examples of pollution and the effects of climate change can be found throughout Nepal, there is no better example of how bad the situation has become than what has happened to the Bagmati River. The river is the most sacred Hindu and Buddhist river in Nepal and its banks border the holiest Hindu temples and several UNESCO heritage sites. Yet, it is the most polluted river in Nepal. The Bagmati River is also a prime example of how adversely climate change can affect a community while, at the same time, highlighting the resiliency and commitment of the residents to continue the fight to mend their river. The importance of the river to the people of Nepal and residents of Kathmandu had resulted in inspiring city-wide community events that have tried to restore the sacred waters. While their efforts are admirable and have motivated government action, little has been done to mitigate climate change causes or to adapt communities to their present conditions or to future projections. The proposed book, documentary and related programming connects the science of water quality and climate change to effects of urban migration, social norms, economics, industrial development, and government policies. The book will also investigate how the river\u2019s condition has affected religious rituals and culture. The inclusion of interviews and artwork by professional artists whose work deals with the Bagmati River will provide a unique visual perspective on Kathmandu\u2019s cultural connection to the river. While the issues investigated are specific to Nepal and the Kathmandu Valley, the general causes of the pollution, degradation of the water and its connection to climate change is reflective of many rivers and communities throughout the world.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Through aesthetically-interesting and related imagery, maps, and graphs, we hope to provide a new perspective on the interconnectedness of science, economics, environmentalism, health issues and art as it relates to the complexities of clean accessible water and the related social issues. By understanding the interrelatedness of complicated issues in the specific local region, the audience can begin to appreciate the complexities and connectiveness of their own locality to the global community.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 The publication was made available in Kathmandu at no cost to the residents to assure wide dissemination of its data to a diverse communities.

The poster and brochures will be distributed to the communities that live along the entire length of the river in Nepal. Members of the Bagmati River Expedition 2015 team, who created a comprehensive report about the river\u2019s water quality, microinvertebrates, avian population and plastics data, have already established connections in these communities. We have worked with Sujan Chitrakar and his graphic design students in designing the posters and brochures. Sujan is the Academic Program Coordinator and an Assistant Professor for Kathmandu University\u2019s School of Art, Center for Art and Design. We will be collaborating with the students at SUNY Fredonia to finish the design of the brochure and poster.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>All elements of the project listed above were finished and presented at the opening of the exhibition on November 20, 2016 at the Siddhartha Gallery in Kathmandu, Nepal.</p>\n\n<p>An exciting extension to this project is to have the artwork, publication, documentary, brochures and posters tour the United States and internationally. The Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo, New York is very interested in the merits of the project and they have volunteered to promote and organize the touring exhibition.Water issues are a worldwide concern and the Bagmati\u2019s perils are not unique. Our hope is that, by touring the exhibition and by combining it with site-specific exhibitions, audiences can create connections between their region and other global communities. There is a good deal that can be learned from the history of the Bagmati as well as from the grass roots efforts that created the Saturday Bagmati River clean-up program and the successful community health initiatives supported by the non-government organizations. All of these efforts has unified the underserved residents of the Kathmandu Valley to address the basic needs in their communities while creating hope and motivating government involvement.</p>\n\n<p>For more information please contact <a href="mailto:alberto@albertorey.com">alberto@albertorey.com</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Project Leaders</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Alberto Rey</strong> \u2013 Distinguished Professor in the Department of Visual Arts and New Media at the State University of New York at Fredonia and for the past 18 years has been the Director and Founder of Children in the Stream Youth Fly fishing Program (<a href="https://albertorey.com/s-a-r-e-p-youth-fly-fishing-program/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://albertorey.com/s-a-r-e-p-youth-fly-fishing-program/</a>).

Is usually delegated to the patients the duty of providing the accurate information about their health condition every visit.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tThe missing digitalization of the gathered health data and the consequent discontinuity of the healing process.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tThe limited precision of the anamnestic research due to the high number of patients and the short time available.</li>\n\n</ol><ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<strong>Final User, individuals and\xa0community target</strong><br>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>ResQ is conceived to ease the communication among physicians (involved in critical context such as emergency hospitals and refugees reception centers) regarding the health state of foreigner patients who don\u2019t know the language of the hosting country. In this way, the tool is designed for physicians, but the main benefits will come for migrating patients whose this services is dedicated to.</p>\n\n<p>\xa0<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZSMi316E-Y" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZSMi316E-Y</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<strong>Solution, brief description of the project</strong><br>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>ResQ is a mobile management tool that improves the communication among healthcare workers (especially physicians, but also volunteers, nurses etc etc...), getting as a result the reduction of the language barrier that very often doesn\u2019t allow foreign patient to fully explain their symptoms or their own pathologies.</p>\n\n<p>The personal pathological condition besides being a psychological kind of weight, for instance when a patient has to explain multiple times his/her condition to a series of different medical specialists, it could also lead to misinterpretation and diagnosis issues when there might be a language barrier.</p>\n\n<p>ResQ is conceived to to be used mainly during the period in which the migrant still doesn\u2019t own a \u201cCodice Fiscale\u201d (personal unique fiscal code), but only a STP card (Straniero Temporaneamente Presente), that makes her/ him able to benefit from the main national healthcare services (for 12 months maximum).</p>\n\n<p>The reception centers that provide the STP card and give the first medical assistance, have to deal with a very high number of people in a stressful situation that often lead to a superficial treatment.</p>\n\n<p>In this way we designed an agile gathering data tool that saves time and in few minutes would be able to fulfill a complete health history of the patients.

How do we create the conditions for\xa0<a class="hashtag" href="/c/8-opencare">#<span>opencare</span></a> in our organisations and our communities? How do we design communities and organisations that are care-full, and promote health and flourishing? I\'m curious about the interplay between policy and culture (as in ways of doing things rather than music and art). Are policies simply\xa0agreements about what we think works and what is right at any given time? Moreover how are they implemented at government or\xa0regional levels and in organisations, if they are to be more than good intentions? Do they end up needing enforced or policed by someone? Are they a tool of old ways of doing things built on hierarchy and power over? What role can they play in\xa0creating the conditions for\xa0opencare or for that matter for love and acceptance and generating\xa0the sense of coherence that Antonovsky describes in <b>salutogenesis</b>\xa0and its approach to study what creates health and well being rather than researching dis-ease?</p>\n\n<p>My work through the GalGael Trust based in the Govan area of Glasgow has offered some hints that actively generating\xa0a healthy\xa0culture is perhaps more effective in achieving in an anchored way the \'good intentions\' of policy. Strong values guide actions, decisions and\xa0behaviour, influence language and how we treat one another. Our workshop sees people working, for the most, part side by side. We\u2019ve had people with violent histories, people who suffer agoraphobia, depression and addiction. Yet something about the space we\u2019ve created has meant that people largely get on, there\u2019ve been no violent incidents in our 20 year history and people describe their doctor taking them off medication, sometimes for the first time in many\xa0years.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not a silver bullet. People lapse. They fall back in to the darkness at times. But there is something undeniable about the environment we\u2019ve created and actively generate that has a therapeutic affect. While some of our participants and volunteers have said \u2018the work is the therapy\u2019 - this refers to the hands on purpose they find in their labours not the work we do with them. So is this as a result of policy or culture? What is it that creates the conditions for an environment of open care? How do we understand the architectures of love that are called for to create a more care-full society?</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve recently spent a year curating a collaborative process to explore what it means to \u2018be GalGael\u2019.

At least, functionality and results make spaces lived by people and changed time to time. Some machines are heavy, but I have seen the 3D printers and other stuff moved easily from one side of the place to the other, or more tables mounted for the newcomers in few minutes. There are also many classes and participants around; so many tables, activities, computers, cables and..of course, people. There is a heterogeneity at work that makes such peculiar activities possible;\xa0 half way instructional, half way productive. When it comes to prototyping, mocking-up, or discussing how to define something that is not standard, or mass produced, there is an involvement on different levels and by different actors. It reminds more of a home life than a factory; there are no written rules about how to deal with spaces and home rules as well, as far as I have understood. Anyway everything seems very well organised and scheduled: MIR guests arrived yesterday, but had already two classes: one about <a href="http://agilemethodology.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">AGILE</a> approach by <a class="mention" href="/u/alessandro_contini">@alessandro_contini</a> and one about Github by <a class="mention" href="/u/costantino">@Costantino</a> .</p>\n\n<p>It is important that everybody here uses and delivers contents using the same tools and integrating to others within the bigger tasks.

The goal was to understand more on how about enforcing the regulations about an access ramp before the shop that can be removed when is not needed. The participants committed nicely by discussing in couples.

A load of pictures was taken around to witness the session.

The paper sheets were layed on the floor and a feedback was given, while <span class="mention">@silviad.ambrosio</span> -another openrampette teamer- patched post-its on a frame poster. The most important part followed. Costantino showed some slides about the contradictions and unclear steps in the procedure, like that -for instance- the ramp \u201cbell\u201d to call who is inside the shop, is mentioned only once on the website of the Municipality and is an important part needed to communicate between the customer, that might be someone who needs to access by a wheelchair, or a mother with a baby buggy. </p>\n\n<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="NeNmf9v3p60" data-youtube-title="Notes from WeMake" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>\n\n<p>Now, some considerations..</p>\n\n<p>First of all, a kind of participatory assessment, based on a broad and heterogeneous participation was appreciated also by <a class="mention" href="/u/alessandro_contini">@alessandro_contini</a> -the designer in charge of the user research meant for shop owners only that will follow this event. What emerged are unexpected cases in-between and common and shared interests among stakeholders. The social dimension emerged as a shared need to construct a substantial and workable objectivity, by a keen and multidimensional analysis of the formal objectivity embedded in the procedure and the script articulated in the fields of the form. What citizens could make visible where aspects of the dimensions for access that usually remain invisible when filling a form or being counseled by a technical advisor. </p>\n\n<p>Makers have a peculiar perspective and bird\'s eye to hack technology and open it. There was great interest around such a technical procedure and bureaucratical details.</p>\n\n<p>A participant even talked about how power be embedded in institutions when it comes to filling forms to satisfy some requirements and how institutions make things difficult. </p>\n\n<p>Open care is certainly related to the dimensions of access to practices, but also to information not as end-users, but as editors and reviewers. The evening was a good example of viable and inspired assemblage of citizens, institutions, norms and devices for the public. </p>\n\n<p><a href="/t/register-for-openvillage-festival-communities-innovation-healthcare-oct-19-21-brussels/6303"></a></p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/ba6281be5dcd475a6b08d26ce01d2bc1920edb70" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/ba6281be5dcd475a6b08d26ce01d2bc1920edb70.png" class="lightbox" title="ACORN (1).png"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/ba6281be5dcd475a6b08d26ce01d2bc1920edb70_1_690x230.png" width="690" height="230"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">ACORN (1).png</span><span class="informations">1500x500 99.2 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p></p>', u'post_id': 850, u'user_id': 3310, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-24 10:09:07', u'title': u'Opening the dimensions of access by openrampette'}, {u'content': u'<p>For the past decade, Alberto Rey has been working on site-specific art installations, websites, books and videos that examine bodies of water around the world and their relationship to social conditions.

Attraverso un processo di ricerca abbiamo evidenziato come un approccio olistico, che a colpo d\u2019occhio fornisca un quadro clinico completo, comporterebbe indubbi vantaggi a medici e pazienti.</p>\n\n<p>1.2 Acquisizione di idee, spunti, intuizioni</p>\n\n<p>Lo spunto iniziale che ha dato l\u2019avvio al progetto \xe8 scaturito da una serie di interviste condotte tra medici e pazienti. Questi ultimi in particolare lamentavano la scarsa preparazione del medico rispetto al loro specifico caso clinico, delegando pertanto al paziente stesso, la responsabilit\xe0 nel fornire informazioni dettagliate circa la patologia da affrontare.</p>\n\n<p>1.3 Definizione del problema</p>\n\n<p>Il problema che abbiamo affrontato pu\xf2 essere definito come una carenza di comunicazione. I diversi professionisti della cura non possiedono, ad oggi, uno strumento semplice e veloce che possa tenerli aggiornati rispetto alla progressione clinica di ogni loro paziente. Le informazioni sanitarie sono disgregate e appartengono allo specialista che le ha prodotte attraverso la propria visita. Queste informazioni tendenzialmente non hanno altro modo di essere condivise, se non attraverso il paziente stesso, cui si delega il compito e la responsabilit\xe0 di fornire tali informazioni allo specialista successivo.</p>\n\n<p>Doc.doc si propone essenzialmente come un aggregatore di informazioni, un unico database medico nel quale possano essere convogliati e organizzati i dati dei pazienti che si hanno in cura. In questo modo il medico pu\xf2 affrontare ogni nuova visita avendo gi\xe0 chiara l\u2019anamnesi pregressa del paziente in questione. Doc.doc inoltre fornisce tutti i contatti degli specialisti che hanno condotto una determinata visita in precedenza, e rende estremamente semplice (un clic) la possibilit\xe0 di mettersi in contatto con un collega per richiedere un chiarimento o un parere rispetto ai dettagli di una certa una cartella clinica.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.0 Definizione</strong></p>\n\n<p>2.1 Analisi delle soluzioni</p>\n\n<p>In seguito ad una estesa sessione di una particolare forma di brainstorming, il brainwriting, sono stati vagliati diversi possibili approcci per affrontare il tema proposto dal bando OpenCare. Questi sono stati categorizzati in modo sistematico secondo la tecnica detta delle 4Cs (le quattro\u201dc\u201d: components, characteristics, challenges, characters) e quindi circoscritti in macro-aree che puntavano ad un certo specifico orientamento verso la risoluzione delle problematiche riscontrate in ambito sanitario.</p>\n\n<p>2.2 Ideazione del concept</p>\n\n<p>In seguito ai risultati scaturiti dalle tecniche di brainstorming, \xe8 stato realizzato un questionario da sottoporre ad un certo numero di pazienti, parenti dei pazienti e professionisti della cura (non solo medici, ma anche infermieri, farmacisti, fisioterapisti etc\u2026).</p>\n\n<p>Queste interviste si sono rivelate cruciali nel definire il percorso che doc.doc avrebbe intrapreso.</p>\n\n<p>Infatti, abbiamo riscontrato presso la maggior parte dei pazienti intervistati, una sostanziale insoddisfazione riguardo i processi di comunicazione con i propri medici. In particolare, nel caso di patologie particolarmente complesse, dove \xe8 necessario il coinvolgimento di molteplici specialisti, spesso i medici coinvolti sono parzialmente o totalmente all\u2019oscuro riguardo i progressi dei colleghi nei confronti di uno specifico aspetto nella cura della patologia. La comunicazione di queste informazioni, avviene, ma quasi esclusivamente per mezzo del paziente, il quale \xe8 costretto ad assumersi la piena responsabilit\xe0 dell\u2019accuratezza e completezza delle informazioni fornite.</p>\n\n<p>2.3 Proposta della soluzione</p>\n\n<p>In seguito alla ricerca svolta, \xe8 stato quindi logico cominciare a pensare alla progettazione di uno strumento gestionale che permettesse ai medici di avere immediatamente disponibili tutte le informazioni concernente un certo paziente, comprese le informazioni di contatto dei colleghi responsabili di una certa visita.</p>\n\n<p>Abbiamo cos\xec progettato uno strumento gestionale che facilita l\u2019organizzazione degli appuntamenti di un medico, ordina in maniera chiara le cartelle cliniche dei pazienti per tipologia e cronologia, permette in un clic di contattare un collega tramite telefono, chat o email, infine rende pi\xf9 efficiente la visita stessa poich\xe9 doc.doc consente al medico curante di aggiornarsi circa i progressi del proprio paziente nei minuti precedenti alla visita.</p>\n\n<p>Doc.doc infatti pu\xf2 essere programmato per concedere uno spazio di tempo (tendenzialmente 10 minuti) tra una visita e l\u2019altra, che permetta al medico di prendere visione della cartella clinica del paziente che sta per incontrare.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.0 Sviluppo</strong></p>\n\n<p>3.1 Progettazione e prova del prototipo</p>\n\n<p>Doc.doc allo stato attuale consiste in un prototipo interattivo realizzato attraverso la piattaforma proto.io.</p>\n\n<p>Prima di ottenere questo risultato abbiamo sostenuto una approfondita analisi UX che ci ha consentito di effettuare scelte precise circa lo sviluppo di certe funzionalit\xe0.\xa0In particolare, attraverso tecniche di Brainwriting e alcune empathy map abbiamo circoscritto l\u2019ambito di lavoro.</p>\n\n<p>A seguito di alcune interviste di orientamento con pazienti e professionisti sanitari abbiamo definito ulteriormente gli obiettivi del progetto, concentrandoci su una \u201cone primary task\u201d, che nel caso di doc.doc consiste nell\u2019aggregazione semplificata dei dati di ogni paziente. Considerando quindi alcuni ipotetici scenari di utilizzo del nostro servizio (presso specialisti\xa0o medici di base, in studio o in visita a domicilio etc\u2026) abbiamo sviluppato una prima logica di user flow e infine la sua realizzazione grafica interattiva, della quale si pu\xf2 avere una tangibile esperienza d\u2019uso qui: <a href="http://bit.ly/2oOXbmK" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://bit.ly/2oOXbmK" rel="nofollow noopener">http://bit.ly/2oOXbmK</a> (una volta scaricata l\'intera\xa0cartella \xe8 sufficiente aprire il file index.html con il proprio browser, meglio se Chrome).</p>\n\n<p>Inoltre in seguito allo sviluppo del prototipo \xe8 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing\xa0che ha evidenziato piccole problematiche, immediatamente risolte con il rilascio della versione successiva, di cui si pu\xf2 prendere visione al link sopracitato.</p>\n\n<p>3.2\xa0Prova della fruibilit\xe0</p>\n\n<p>E\u2019 stato condotto un piccolo usability testing, parzialmente moderato, che ha sostanzialmente confermato tutti gli obiettivi di usabilit\xe0 stabiliti a monte. In particolare i nostri utenti test sono stati, per la maggior parte, in grado di portare a termine le operazioni richieste, quali: 1. Consultare una cartella clinica, 2. Consultare la rubrica pazienti e professionisti, 3. Aggiungere un nuovo appuntamento, 4. Contattare un collega. In questa fase abbiamo ritenuto prematuro considerare ulteriore metriche di controllo oggettive quali tempi e statistiche di errore, concentrandoci piuttosto su misurazioni di gradimento soggettive e mantenendo come unico conteggio obiettivo il numero di operazioni portate a buon fine.</p>\n\n<p>Sono stati riscontrati alcuni problemi nella fruibilit\xe0 dei dati della cartella clinica e delle funzionalit\xe0 ad essa collegate (\xe8 infatti possibile anche iniziare una conversazione\xa0con un collega). L\u2019organizzazione dei contenuti di quella determinata schermata \xe8 stata quindi modificata sulla base dei feedback ricevuti, cos\xec come l\u2019intero look&amp;feel dell\u2019applicazione \xe8 stato rivisto coerentemente rispetto alle modifiche apportate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4.0 Rilascio</strong></p>\n\n<p>4.1 Completamento del prodotto/servizio</p>\n\n<p>Il prototipo \xe8 gi\xe0 stato testato, ma andrebbe ulteriormente verificato su un campione pi\xf9 esteso di utenti, seguito eventualmente da un A/B testing.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusa la fase di usability testing sul prototipo, si proceder\xe0 quindi con lo sviluppo di programmazione vero e proprio, la\xa0cui funzionalit\xe0\xa0verr\xe0\xa0verificata\xa0ad ogni milestone raggiunta.</p>\n\n<p>Infine, verranno concepite strategie di distribuzione, idealmente con il coinvolgimento delle ASL locali, per permettere un capillare ed effettivo utilizzo del servizio.</p>\n\n<p>4.2 Rilascio finale</p>\n\n<p>E\u2019 in fase di definizione una timeline di sviluppo che presenti le milestone necessarie al completamento del prodotto, secondo specifiche tempistiche.</p>\n\n<p>4.3 Produzione</p>\n\n<p>Il team di sviluppo tecnico \xe8 ancora da definirsi, ma stiamo valutando una collaborazione con I-SEE\xa0(<a href="http://www.i-seecomputing.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.i-seecomputing.com</a>), specialisti nell produzione di software in ambito medico/ sanitario.</p>', u'post_id': 33729, u'user_id': 3596, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-03 14:39:04', u'title': u'MIR application - doc.doc (now ResQ)'}, {u'content': u'<p>Our next meeting is on <strong>June 7th, 8 pm @ ReaGent</strong>.

A collision of honest and upfront conversations about existential experiences and a research of numerous solutions that had yet to be exploited in a certain context, rethinking their business models.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, SoundSight was a completely new initiative. A virtual gym to train echolocation, and while the idea of features and UX design accumulated quickly, the team pursued a proof-of-concept and something that others could think of as a minimum viable product.</p>\n\n<p>The first prototype was a mess. To the users invited to a test, it must have seemed unbelievable how a software engineer could have thought that a piece of software reverberating in a fixed environment and artificial sound would have been enough to suggest how the platform would work. Not to mention, a command line interface, and a rather lengthy procedure to change the position within the simulated environment. But thanks to the outgoing and always positive outlook of Irene, they never thought of disinvesting: SoundSight was an experience for them.</p>\n\n<p>The team worked hectically on Irene\u2019s feedbacks, and a really workable proof-of-concept finally became available around Spring 2015.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s leave it again to Irene\u2019s recollection:</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cHello Mario<a name="&lt;/em&gt;ftnref1" title>[1]</a>, we are here again\u2026 this time I promise you will be impressed\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cHi Irene, it\u2019s a pleasure\u2026 and rest assured, last time I was already impressed, although maybe not as you hoped for\u2026 with my friends we have been laughing a lot about your engineer\u2019s idea of a prototype!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cOh no, Mario\u2026 don\u2019t abuse him, or who knows when we will find another person with the same talent and will to do something meaningful even with no immediate profit in sight! I am counting on you to keep certain things\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cDon\u2019t worry Irene, I have only told the story to one or two\u2026 hundreds of people\u2026 ahahah!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cDoh! \u2026ok Mario, then to pay you back, today\u2019s text will be extra tough!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cI am ready for the challenge!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene sets up the simulation</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cOK Mario, it\u2019s ready. I would like to ask you to try the first round without me sharing with you any information\u2026 I want you to focus on your impressions only, tell me how it feels\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201clet\u2019s start\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The simulation is run, Mario is moved to several places in a cathedral in this virtual world, and listens to the echoes of a tongue click</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cIndeed there have been a lot of improvements, it is smooth now\u2026 last time it was a bit of an annoyance to have to wait for so long every time you wanted to move the position. However, listening to a prerecorded tongue click\u2026 are you sure these are simulations?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cYes Mario\u2026 we know it still requires a bit of imagination, but I assure you this is a real time simulation. Later during the tests, I will offer you the possibility to move the position arbitrarily, and you should notice it. It is definitely on our list of priorities to introduce real-time input of user generated tongue clicks\u2026 we are just not there yet\u2026 you are one of our very early testers, and I cannot thank you enough for that\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cDon\u2019t, I enjoy this experience, and I really like the concept. Somehow contributing to its realization makes me proud. However, you need my honest opinions, and I think the ability to exploit the user\u2019s own tongue click will improve the experience terrifically. I have realized that you have made me move through wide and small environments\u2026 but I haven\u2019t been able to identify where I was.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cThat\u2019s already quite good Mario! I have only given you one point for each environment, and you have already been able to tell something about them\u2026 you are the best! We will focus on learning curves and performances later again, can you tell me anything else about your general impressions at the moment?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell you more from just this\u2026 maybe we can move to the next exercise?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cYes, here we go. Get ready, and now I will let you walk through the environment of today, and you will hear repeated clicks\u2026 try to guess what it would be\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Just a quick run of the new scenario on the simulator</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201chmmm\u2026 the smoothness has improved a lot\u2026 but I really could not tell you what it is. It seems a large environment, I have been getting away from a wall and after getting closer to another?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cI had told you would not have an easy life, after those jokes about our engineer Mario! But you did quite well. It was a cathedral\u2026 now that I have told you, could you confirm it or would you still be doubtful?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cLet me try to listen again\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u2026the simulator runs again shortly</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cYes Irene, now that I know, it could well be\u2026 I had some doubts, with no context it could have been a theater or a large gym, \u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cIndeed\u2026 now I would like you to do a few exercises\u2026 I will tell you this time what you are going to listen to, precisely, and you will have to focus on the features\u2026 later there will be a test\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cFor me or for the software?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cFor both, Mario, don\u2019t try to escape your responsibilities\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cAhahah\u201d</p>\n\n<p>They run the training set</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cWell Irene, we will see how I perform later\u2026 but you should consider developing an interface to feed information about structures, volumes, and positions, directly to your users\u2026 it is nice to chat with you, but if you really think of this as a tool for making echolocation training accessible to anyone, the fact that you need to have by your side another person as your interface to the system doesn\u2019t add up\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cYou are right. Together with the real-time acquisition of users\u2019 clicks, this interface is at the top of our list of priorities. We are thinking of using a simple tablet of mechanically executed needles to offer a map of the space being tested and a natural interface\u2026 or some haptic 3D interface, but that may be more expensive and complicated. We have not yet looked into that enough\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cYou would need a lot of needles to offer a useful interface\u2026 you can try prototyping something quick maybe with Arduino\u2026 but I would be a lot more curious about the haptic interface. I have seen some applications with holograms and they looked impressive.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cWe will keep this in mind. Of course, we need to make it as simple and cheap as possible, but still functional\u2026 and we hope the prices of that hardware will be democratized soon. Now that we have taken a small break\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cWhat break? Are you not letting me off yet?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cMario, let\u2019s just take the test before the coffee\u2026 I will let you off then, for today\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cOk, ok\u2026 a no is not possible anyway, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cIt\u2019s always possible, but I will insist with a smile\u201d</p>\n\n<p>They run the tests</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201dif we compare today\u2019s performances to those from the last tests, both with the software and in the lab with the moving panels, you have really gotten better Mario!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cBut Irene, how can I be sure if I have truly learned? I mean\u2026 we should arrange tests where there are coupled with some sort of benchmark\u2026 maybe similar tests in real world, you could imagine a mobile lab to do so\u2026 or even just arrange competitions among users\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cThat\u2019s a really good idea, Mario! We will seriously reflect on how to arrange this, but for the time being\u2026 do you think your partner would like to try it out against you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mario: \u201cBut she sees\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Irene: \u201cit should not be an advantage, and I promise you I will not show her the screen\u201d</p>\n\n<p>This is now a different story\u2026 but after being initially baffled, Mario\u2019s partner took it to her heart to seriously compete with him, and in the end, she won one of the tests, confirming <strong>anyone can learn this skill</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><a name="&lt;/em&gt;ftnref1" title>1</a>\xa0Please be reminded that Mario is a blind guy. However, the language of sight is so ingrained in our culture\u2026</p>', u'post_id': 578, u'user_id': 3279, u'timestamp': u'2017-06-11 17:55:07', u'title': u'Collision of Conversations Part 2-Soundsight'}, {u'content': u'<p>With modern day communication technology sharing through email, social media and Skype it rarely encourages people to share the evolution of their project. We often list, number, bullet point, but seldom do we engage in informal discussions where we share knowledge and reflect. It\u2019s in the reflection that we witness human capital being the driving force behind our projects. It\u2019s worth taking a look at SoundSight, whose story has sparked curiosity in co-creating care solutions. \xa0There are many factors that determine the direction of our projects. For\xa0<a href="http://www.soundsight.ch/" rel="nofollow noopener">SoundSight</a>\xa0it has been an ongoing commitment of the human capital to bring forward this project.Experiencing co-creation is a method to bring value to patients in a personalized way with the intention to benefit patients in coping with their health and enhance their quality of life. Looks as though co-creating is the road where the community is defining the destination, planning the journey and sharing the drive. \xa0Let\u2019s hear from Irene\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI can never thank the Reggio Emilia blind people union enough for accepting me in their community and interacting with me so sincerely and proactively. Let me say that 2 years ago I started spending some time with them, to enquire about their daily challenges, and to shadow some of them (who kindly volunteered) during their daily routines, I had conceived this as any other didactic activity of my university education, excitingly on the field, but not more special\u2026 how wrong could I have been!</p>\n\n<p>Long story short, I had reached out as part of a design thinking exercise, after brainstorming with my colleagues over social and technical literature to find solutions to the challenge of blind people navigation through living environments, \u201csimply\u201d to extract narratives about what we thought their problem to be and, thus, tune our solutions\u2026 We had succeeded obtaining the information we wanted, we had lists of the defeating features of currently existing solutions, descriptions of use cases, but while working on the desired features, something started to emerge for some of us in the team: another narrative had been seeping through our conversations with the blind volunteers, that we did not consider in advance. Most of the blind people we had talked to, despite agreeing to the obstacles imposed by visual impairment, did not consider that a defining condition and were rather cold to any assistive technology they tested or we described. Instead, narratives of empowerment, education, disintermediation, were flowing through most of their replies, even when our conversations were explicitly biased towards solutions\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Let this sink for a moment. And remember that the number one challenge of helping another person is falling in love with the solution one wants to offer, losing sight of the\xa0<strong>person</strong>\xa0in exchange for the\xa0<strong>problem</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So we asked Irene to recollect her most significant conversation for us:</p>\n\n<p>IL (<strong><em>Irene Lanza</em></strong>): \u201c<em>Good morning Maria<a href="/en/opencare-research/human-capital-is-what-drives-a-project-forward-part#&lt;em&gt;ftn1" name="&lt;/em&gt;ftnref1" title rel="nofollow noopener">[</a>\xa0I would like to thank you already for your time\u2026 it is truly precious to me to be able to talk with you\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p>MBC (<strong><em>Mother of an 11years old blind child</em></strong>): \u201cGood morning Irene. I have heard about you from my friends and fellows from the blind union\u2026 they say you are a very polite and smart girl\u201d</p>\n\n<p>IL: \u201cAww\u2026 how much will they ask me to pay, now? \u2026haha\u201d</p>\n\n<p>MBC: \u201chaha\u201d</p>\n\n<p>IL: \u201cDid they also already tell you about what I would like to talk today?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>MBC: \u201cvaguely\u2026 apparently, you are working on a new technology to assist blind people in their daily life\u2026?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>IL: \u201cThat is fairly accurate, but luckily they did not spoil our fun by letting you in too many details. In facts, we are working at the proof-of-concept of a wearable device that could analyze the surroundings in real time and feed information about objects, their velocities, and positions to a visually impaired user, to allow him/her moving naturally through a living environment\u2026 our challenge is to allow a blind person to play a football game competitively against people with normal vision\u2026 well, we would still not provide talent though\u201d</p>\n\n<p>MBC: \u201cSo, are you thinking of something like those apps on the smartphones?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>IL: \u201cWell, not really\u2026 we would have dedicated hardware, and we would like to collect your opinions about how to design the user interface\u2026 a smartphone app would be a proof-of-concept compared to the kind of product design we are pursuing\u201d</p>\n\n<p>MBC: \u201cI don\u2019t like this kind of assistive technology much\u2026 you never know it will let you down. So many factors: the signal may be lost, the battery may go down, the app could crash\u2026 what should I do then?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>IL: \u201cThis is exactly what I am here to listen to\u2026 you see, we will collect all these opinions, and try to prioritize features in our design concept\u2026 so, have you already tried some of those?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>MBC: \u201cI am constantly exploring and searching for new tricks and tools that could help Mario, so I often talk about this topic with my friends at the union, and I try some them after reading their reviews or hearing their presentations. Most of them are quite far away from real life, for they are very specialized on single use cases, and they rely on infrastructural investments that in our Country are stagnating for too long already. Mario\u2019s problems extend well beyond walking through an airport or a shopping mall or reading the label on a tomato can. The only tool I really find useful is the reader with vocal synthesis on the smartphone: it works pretty well and it\u2019s so precious to be able to listen to any book when audiobooks are still not the norm\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>IL: \u201cSo could you tell me more about Mario\u2019s experience? What do you think are the most commonplace barriers he experiences when going to school? How does he roam around?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>MBC: \u201cHe is training with the stick. Many people dislike it, but it is rather dependable and attracts sufficient attention to ensure that other people will be more cooperative and safely behaved. However everyday life can become very problematic. Architectures are often hiding traps that would surprise for the naivety of those who designed the spaces: you would never imagine the feeling of dread when you have just seen your son missing an unprotected element from a window, protruding out of a wall with its sharp corners\u2026 and the use of the spaces themselves can be even more challenging! Hanging wires, doors opening directly on stairs, elements built in non-shock-resistant glass. Many of these, if you ask me, would be dangerous to any child, but if you factor in the inability to forecast what you are going to meet next\u2026 The risk of bad practices escalates quickly!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>IL: \u201cSo school is not a safe haven for Mario\u2026?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>MBC: \u201cNot just that\u2026 most activities are not structured to include children like Mario. Schoolbooks are more difficult to find as eBooks for the vocal synthesizer than others. Even then, many graphics, whether didactic or there for testing purposes, remain inaccessible\u2026 and even the teachers, despite being adorable with Mario, are not informed about methods for inclusive teaching\u2026 For example, my husband is a musician, and he has always tried to exploit musical theory to organize our family games (she mocks for me a couple of games based on recognizing the tones, or what an object at home could be based on analogies of noises). We constantly try to use acoustics as a tool to explain concepts, and risks to our child\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>IL: \u201c\u2026and this, of course, doesn\u2019t happen at school\u201d</p>\n\n<p>MBC: \u201cNot even closely. School sometimes becomes a very frustrating experience\u2026 a place of isolation to remind Mario of his diversity. Irene, you are young, you must remember your lectures of geometry, for example\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>IL: \u201cyes, indeed\u2026 mostly graphics are drawn on the blackboard\u2026 I see what you mean\u201d</p>\n\n<p>MBC: \u201ceven our language is geared for the idea that\xa0<em>seeing is believing</em>. Mario often tells me that he has seen a schoolmate with a certain outfit or some event that he is going to tell me about\u2026 he does enormously to find his place in society. And my husband and I do our maximum to help him surpass the social barriers: we teach him games that he can play with his friends, we accompany him to familiarize with the places where he will have to interact with his mates, and we drill into him, constantly, how to react to the unexpected, hoping that panic will never prevail. Technology, instead of these half-baked attempts at substituting vision for simple tasks, should take on education\u2026 there is so much more that is lost in our societies when one cannot see than just reading on a can whether it is tomato or green peas, and nurturing those skills that we all have as fellow humans, rather than focusing on what we lack, would be so much more empowering.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>IL: \u201cwhat you say is very inspirational\u2026 so you believe education is the true mean of supporting Mario\u2026 and what is the place of technology in your vision?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>MBC: \u201cwe live in a time obsessed with technology, and we forget that it is just a tool. I have not hidden from you, I am not a big supporter of the idea. For example, we use the e-reader with voice synthesizer\u2026 the problem is extremely important, but not mission critical, and so the technical solution makes sense\u2026 I am not sure I would delegate to technology, or to other humans for what is worth it, many other things on a regular base\u2026 what would be the meaning of life, if you give up on the very experiences that make it worth sharing and living? We are social animals, someone more important than me said once\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>IL: \u201cMaria, thank you really for letting me peer into your family life\u2026 and thank you for your kind guidance. I hope that we will be able to live to your expectations, but I can already promise you that we will at least try our best!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>MBC: \u201cIt has been my pleasure Irene, it is so nice to meet a young person trying with enthusiasm to tackle a problem we have to deal and cope with every day. I wish you the best of luck, and I look forward to hearing about your progress!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When Irene went back to the team after this conversation, she was confused, for having just experienced the most confrontational conversation about their project. Irene was moved emotionally by the passion and interest expressed by the mother. An experience that would leave her forever changed and stretched.</p>\n\n<p>With Irene insisting, a small group of three people from the original team started diverging from the original path of designing a wearable \u201csmall world\u201d navigation system. They started brainstorming wildly about educational concepts.</p>\n\n<p>Independently from the rest of the team, which opposed the need to bring to completion the academic assignment, they sought a new agreement with their mentor and started optimal\xa0thinking at 360\xba. Using 3D ultrasound-based haptic interfaces to offer interactive geometry education or simulators for practical tasks that would completely substitute visualization for acoustic and tactile feedbacks? Most of the early ideas were dropped when their mentor, or people not involved in the team that he suggested to talk to, would object other low-tech solutions (e.g.: wooden models for 3D geometry) could deliver almost the same experience, significantly undercutting the complexities of the projects.</p>\n\n<p>It was during this na\xefve and intense search, that their mentor showed them a video of a blind person using tongue clicks to echolocate while biking (!!!).

We also must know and understand the characteristics of the population and problems. Gender Equality is an issue that increasingly attracting attention and I'm glad that it is so, because we have to face with problems in intention to solve. Especially in the Balkans because of the tradition, male dominance and patriarchy dogma, we can`t even speak about gender equality. Violence against women is a common phenomenon, discrimination in employment, obtaining dismissal due to pregnancy, sexual harassment at work, on the street, not to mention the Roma communities, where women have almost no rights, the situation is bad, and even alarming.</p>\n\n<p>Women are treated as less valuable, challenging their basic human rights. The right to education, freedom of movement, the right to vote, the right to decide about their marriage, not to be forced, mutilated or rejected by family, society if they do not abide by traditional rules and norms, teen marriage, teen pregnancy, violence against a woman, more often situation.</p>\n\n<p>The violence being perpetrated against girls and women it takes on epidemic proportions.</p>\n\n<p>And instead of every day a woman to be given more heed, honored, a pillar of society and the family, it is at the margin, not only neglected but also abused, physically and mentally exhausted,, without the right to fight for themselves ,their \xa0life, their well-being.</p>\n\n<p>Women who are the most oppressed are precisely those without education, personal income . How many women and girls were sexually exploited, raped ...</p>\n\n<p>What are the primary tasks?</p>\n\n<p>\xa0To be primarily pledge any form of violence and abuse, to provide education, training. Selection of partners is free will, the right to contraception, the right to health care, the right to equal pay, the right to be employed, not to be discriminated just because it's a woman, it does not get fired when she went on maternity leave, to receive compensation while pregnant, the right to social protection, in health insurance and care.</p>\n\n<p>The right to engage in politics of his country, to participate in the economy, not only as a worker, but also as an entrepreneur, manager, trustee</p>\n\n<p>To be more women in science, the arts, that were not created just to take care of home, children, family, that are free to read, write, engage in teachings, scientific research\u2026.</p>\n\n<p>Many seem that women seek the impossible, seek the same thing does not belong to them.

The glove designed for proprioceptive rehabilitation and to recover movement fluidity after an injury.\xa0 It allows the patient to record and report exercises, data- such as hand position and fingertips pressure.</p>\n\n<p>In 2014 Sara\xa0Savian\xa0and Mauro Alfieri started their journey with a \u201ctest on sensors \u201cand they had presented their first prototype at the Arduino User Group &amp; Wearables community at WeMake. The purpose for this to share projects, knowledge and create discussions on Arduino and Wearables and smart textiles.\xa0 The intent was to explore how it can be used? How can it add value and be of use socially?\xa0 What could be built on this foundation? These discussions could change the course for many participants.</p>\n\n<p>Sara and Mauro not only had many questions answered, but they left with the idea of going back to the drawing board and creating something that would be beneficial to society.</p>\n\n<p>A conversation between a physiotherapist and someone suffering from hand disability created inquiry for Sara and Mauro. They exchanged and shared thoughts on their project, how could it be of use and that led to further discussion. It was the trigger point for them and a stepping stone for their project. We can\u2019t capture every discussion that took place as dialogue is woven into many discussions. But this one interaction planted the seed for what is now reHub.</p>\n\n<p>\xa0We asked Sara to recollect this conversation:</p>\n\n<p><em>John: "I suffer from a hand disability that limits my activities of daily life. Self-sufficiency is greatly reduced and hinders the quality of life for me. Constant monitoring of my movements and joints must be done frequently to evaluate my progress by and going back and forth as an outpatient for evaluations. This interferes with my daily activities\u201d*</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Physiotherapist: \u201cThere has been an advancement in technologies in the rehabilitation to help patients achieve maximum recovery outcomes. In Italy, physiotherapists have no access to digital tools to evaluate rehabilitative progress for hand movements. Having instant access to this therapy anytime would be greatly beneficial.*</em></p>\n\n<p><em>We asked Sara and Mauro how this conversation altered the course for reHub.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Sara: \u201cThis made us re-evaluate our project in a variety of ways and prompted us to think in broader terms and combine the "test on sensors" with solving a problem. We know that there is a lot of learning that needs to be done when you put the device in the hands of people that are just things you would not expect".\xa0</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Mauro: From this discussion, Sara and I saw the opportunity offer a solution and an experience of an emerging area of wearable technology together with the sensing technology and decided to create a device that could be delivered in a rehabilitation approach to support patients\u2019 and to monitor hand rehabilitation. From listening to challenges that are faced on a daily basis, and realizing how painful it is for the patient and family. We need to work with them to help co-create with us\u201d.</em></p>\n\n<p>With the project in its early stage, Sara wanted to share this:</p>\n\n<p>Sara: \u201cThere is much work to do including working with actual users and receiving their feedback. With the goal of making it open source, fully customizable and adaptable, a community of user is required. We are solving the problem of monitoring the progress of rehabilitation therapy and the people directly impacted must be included.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We asked what\u2019s next for reHub.</p>\n\n<p><em>Sara: "We know that rehabilitation is time-consuming and demotivating and we plan to change that with a reHub device to empower patients through their therapy. Rehabilitation is often costly, by making it open source, it\u2019s affordable and accessible for people who are living with limitation and this could drastically improve their mental well-being during the road of recovery\u201d. This will allow the vast majority of patients to be sent home with a rehabilitation program to practice on their smartphone or tablet."</em></p>\n\n<p>The reHub team is taking a broad approach in this area and looking for users and a community that will benefit and help develop different options: sport, gaming, educational, medical.</p>\n\n<p>Why is it important to work with the community to further develop reHub?</p>\n\n<p><em>Sara: "Spending time with a community, or patients that will benefit from what you\u2019re creating is looking at the problem in a human-centered way and it highlight\u2019s what\u2019s needed instead of just relying on responses to questions. Spending time with people in the area of use is a really important step in the design process. So we\u2019re back to the drawing board. We need to know what from the user\'s perspective so we can design with them in mind."</em></p>\n\n<p>Co-creation, it matters. There is the emotional and functional connection that people have to a medical device. As far as functional, understanding how people use things, what they need to get done daily. \xa0When we think of medical devices we initially think of accuracy, consistency, making sure it delivers the expected results. These are crucial reasons why design should be human oriented.</p>\n\n<p>Mauro Alfieri: \u201cWe thank all the physiotherapists we have had a chance to meet with \xa0which could effectively confront the future of this project, orienting it to a continuous use in proprioceptive physiotherapy."</p>\n\n<p>If people can\u2019t achieve expected results due to a design issue or flaw, then that\u2019s obviously going to have a clinical impact. From a functional aspect, understanding how people use things does matter. This is where engineering, design and the community will benefit and need to work hand in hand to understand these components. It\u2019s crucial to consider human emotions when designing medical products. Often, it\u2019s the emotional connections that people have with respect to the design. Is it flexible? The weight, how it feels, is it aesthetically appealing?</p>\n\n<p>Then, of course, cost and accessibility that make people gravitate toward certain devices as opposed to others. With the joined forces of diverse backgrounds of Sara and Mauro, reHub will be addressing all these concerns.</p>\n\n<p>reHub-goal-oriented effective rehabilitative treatment and experience that will help patients return to family, job, community and resume regular daily activities.</p>\n\n<p>More updates to follow.</p>\n\n<p>*The name of John and Physiotherapist have been used to maintain privacy.</p>', u'post_id': 861, u'user_id': 3279, u'timestamp': u'2017-06-06 11:19:24', u'title': u'Community Conversations -reHub'}, {u'content': u'<p>This week the opencare team of WeMake welcomed a new member.</p>\n\n<p>Lorenzo Romagnoli (<a href="http://lorenzoromagnoli.me/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://lorenzoromagnoli.me/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://lorenzoromagnoli.me/</a>) is an interaction designer that will be in charge of developing the mock-up and co-designing with users and other makers the needed prototypes for the projects openrampette and MIR.</p>\n\n<p>As first mission Lorenzo will be in charge of the \u201ccall\u201d part of openrampette; i.e. the device, or the solution meant to call the shop attendants.

Noel is studying how to design the construct for insulin such that a the two parts can reliably find each other.</p>\n\n<p>His design is based on the strong affinity between barnase and barstar. Barnase (resp. barstar) are connected to one of the insulin chains using a linker. When the barnase-barstar complex is formed, insulin should form by proximity. This also circumvents the risk of the formation of two chains of the same kind bonding (A-A or B-B).</p>\n\n<p>Such insuline-barnase-barnstar complexes should aggregate into a large complex of many such molecules, from which pure, functional insulin can easily be cleaved. Admittedly, I did not follow this 100%.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The challenge here is to design such linker as such the complex can be formed. To this end, Noel writes his own software to do mechanistic molecular modelling. He computes all the molecular (polar, Vanderwaals, \u2026) interactions between amino acids to finally obtain the stability of a complex. For a given linker, this is represented by a set of (sparse) matrixes quantifying the strength of the interactions between the amino acids.</p>\n\n<p>This is the point where machine learning comes into play:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Using a set of example matrices, predict the matrices for new AA chains</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Perhaps use the information to directly build a model to predict stability of a given linker?

By scanning the QR code with a smartphone, users are led to an interactive website where they may upload images and text of well wishes to the deceased and their family, or contribute to building their family heritage through stories or family trees. Users are also able to re-share their post on more mainstream social media.</p>\n\n<p>As an anthropologist and ethnographer of digital culture, I have a comprehensive understanding of such practices. But when my younger sister passed away earlier this year, the ways in which her friends expressed and managed their grief in digital spaces led me to discover a rich repertoire of coping mechanisms, exchange of affect, and mutual aftercare in a vernacular created by young people who grew up with the internet - these really moved my heart and encouraged me to examine young people and grief in digital spaces.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But\xa0just what is mutual aftercare? </strong>Often after a global grieving event such as large-scale natural disasters or spates of violence, strangers would gather in public spaces that transform into transient sites of solidarity. With candles, flowers, and written tributes in tow, strangers come together to process their grief, share their grief, and lend support to those in grief. Bodies who are not familiar with each other are motivated by the immediate, tangible, and tactile presence of other bodies in an enclosed space to disperse emotions they would usually restraint, and dispense care they would usually withhold when the group\u2019s motivations are briefly aligned. Sociologist Emile Durkheim refers to this as \u201ccollective effervescence\u201d. <strong>This is \u2018aftercare\u2019, or the care one offers to others after a hurtful experience. When people come together to publicly acknowledge their pain and simultaneously offer care and concern to fellow others in pain, this becomes a network of \u2018mutual aftercare\u2019. </strong>Young people seem to be doing similar things in digital spaces, and I wanted to find out how.</p>\n\n<p><b>*</b></p>\n\n<p>Being a young person in my mid-twenties for whom the internet and social media is second nature, I seamlessly took to my blog to make sense of my grief and loss. I wrote about my experiences of <a href="https://wishcrys.com/2016/05/25/what-holding-space-really-looks-like/" rel="nofollow noopener">\u201cholding space\u201d for my sister</a><b> </b>in her final days (see also<b> </b><a href="http://heatherplett.com/2015/03/hold-space/" rel="nofollow noopener">Heather Plett</a>), and about learning to<b> </b><a href="https://wishcrys.com/2016/07/25/grief-and-the-distance-of-decluttering/" rel="nofollow noopener">declutter physical artifacts</a> despite my abstract emotional attachment to these things. I also wrote about how I felt when<b> </b>Facebook friends began<b> </b><a href="https://wishcrys.com/2016/08/31/grief-and-deep-liking-on-facebook/" rel="nofollow noopener">\u201cdeep-liking\u201d my old posts on grief</a> and how it impeded my progress and recovery. As much as I felt hurt and disappointed by these peers, I could not justify my anger knowing that <strong>digital etiquette is not universal \u2013 knowing how to approach someone in grief on social media or how to express grief on social media is not actually \u201ccommon sense\u201d. </strong>Digital etiquette varies across personal beliefs and cultural norms, and is highly dependent on the context of interpersonal relationships and the norms of a social media platform. In other words, <strong>digital etiquette surrounding grief has to be taught, learnt, and practiced.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I was both a young person managing grief in digital spaces and an ethnographer invested in understanding everyday practices through intimate anthropological inquiry. To do this, I conducted personal interviews with young people who self-reported using digital media (i.e. the internet, social media, devices and artifacts, non-analogue spaces) to manage their grief. I started with friends in my sister\u2019s social groups, made open calls to undergraduates in local universities, and amassed informants via snowball sampling.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to understand what young people did on the internet to recover and how this differed from analogue coping mechanisms pre-social media. I wanted to learn how they constructed solidarity, conveyed empathy, and maintained networks of mutual aftercare. Some also showed me their smartphone apps so that I could study how they crafted content, ranging from emotive Instagram captions of meaningful photographs to extensive digital catalogues of every tactile item the deceased has ever touched.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I learnt that a vocabulary of grief was quietly emerging among young people. </strong>For instance, emoji and emoticons were especially significant as a paralanguage. Some reported that \u201cwhen words fail\u201d, or when they \u201chad no strength\u201d to craft responses back to friends who had sent them condolences, they would mobilize emoji or emoticons to acknowledge receipt, demonstrate reciprocity, or express gratitude. One person who had lost his father to a critical illness said that while \u201cthe adults\u201d in his family did not seem to articulate their grief and loss to each other (\u201cthey strictly never said anything about it in the house\u201d), those in his generation such as his cousins took to Facebook to comfort each other via status updates and follow-up comments. Another young person began a groupchat on the messaging app WhatsApp and recruited friends of the deceased from all walks of life into the chat. They used the groupchat as a semi-private outlet to share their thoughts without having to worry about self-censorship \u2013 many of them felt Facebook was \u201ctoo public\u201d, that email was \u201ctoo impersonal\u201d, and that meeting in person was \u201ctoo soon\u201d, \u201ctoo painful\u201d, or \u201ctoo awkward\u201d. As such, the space of a groupchat accorded them the freedom to process grief more transparently among empathetic others in a safe space; the groupchat became a space of mutual aftercare.</p>\n\n<p><b>*</b></p>\n\n<p>The need to understand young people\u2019s grief in digital spaces became clearer to me as I began consulting and conversing with healthcare professionals in palliative care. One hospice nurse expressed that as a patient approaches their end of life, most family members would single-heartedly focus all their effort and affect on that one person. <strong>Upon the death of their loved one, many people are suddenly hit with grief all at once and are unable to transit into care for each other, or \u201ccare for the living\u201d. </strong>In other words, despite social workers and counsellors preaching the value of \u201ccare chains\u201d, many people who are deep in grief simply do not have the mental capacity and physical resources to plan for self-care or mutual aftercare.</p>\n\n<p>Another doctor reported seeing an increasing number of young patients in their late teens or early-to-mid twenties. Sorrowfully recounting a memorable incident in which her young patient instructed her to post a specifically-worded status update on his Facebook after death, she came to realize that young people deeply valued their digital estates as platforms to communicate gratitude and farewells even on their deathbed. In a handful of other instances, young patients requested for their doctors and counsellors to add them on Facebook or to read their blog in order to access sentiment they felt incapable of articulating in person, in physical spaces, via traditional media</p>\n\n<p>Despite the very crucial work that such palliative staff engage in, much of this work is negotiated ad hoc on-the-go as they \u201cplay by ear\u201d. Most staff do \u201cwhat feels right\u201d based on their individual relationships with their patients, or on their personal concepts of etiquette and ethics. In other words, <strong>once we have a better understanding of how young people grief in digital spaces, palliative healthcare workers can be equipped to guide their young patients and clients using their preferred coping mechanisms, devices, and vocabulary.</strong> To a generation for whom death and grief are increasingly public spectacles, such care will be crucial to preserving the mental well being of cohorts to come.</p>\n\n<p><b>*</b></p>\n\n<p>Have you ever commemorated the death of a loved one in digital spaces?

Turbulent past, dynamic present and an uncertain future, burdensome by intolerance and conflicts in the region, which I personally found not only unnecessary but also totally crazy, because we all have the same desires and dreams, to live freely, love unconditionally, have fun, learn, be independent, travel, have amazing adventures, the best parties \u2026. without regard to national and religious affiliation, skin color, eye color\u2026 there are too many prejudice, inequality, unprotected and vulnerable people, there is gender inequality, intolerance, social injustice, poverty, hunger, disease, non-existent or inadequate health care, problems of refugees, racism\u2026. I do not know why and I`m trying to understand. Injustice affects me terribly. We learn history in order to avoid the mistakes which were made and were pretty catastrophic, and to me it seems like we constantly repeat the same errors. I have learned not to judge in advance, that all deserve respect, a smile, a kind word, that the mind is like a parachute works only if it is open, that in the period of globalization, IT progress, revolutionary discoveries, scientific achievements, robotics, nanotechnology \u2026 we must not think about limits, all barriers and borders exists\xa0 only in our heads., I perfectly understand what it means conflict, and detest it, I hate arguing, hate conflicts. I watch the news, read a newspaper and follow social networks and\xa0 I can say there is too much violence, too much suffering, too much of everything negative, the constant threat of war, terrorism\u2026just too much. I want a better world, a better society, a better life for all, it is important to take care of others, to be open-minded. I want more, I need more, no one should be afraid for ones lives, children must not be hungry, barefoot, on the streets, women must not be abused, people should not be expelled from their homes, the world gone crazy and we desperately need all people of good will who want and have the knowledge and strength to fight, not only to philosophize and criticize, but also commit to work, to improve our society, day after day, devotedly\u2026</p>\n\n<p>They tell us that as individuals we can<code>t do anything, at least anything important, that we are still small, young and inexperienced, but adults forget, and sometimes reduces our value, ignored it, forget it under the weight of today circumstances. We are thirsty for knowledge and education, we might be weak, but snowflakes are gentle and weak until they connect, then they become strong. We need to connect, as snowflakes, the youth of the region and the world, only united we can be strong, important, perhaps adults hear us and listen. When children quarrel, they quickly reconcile because it</code>s not important to be right, but to be happy. We should accept that we do not have to agree on everything, sometimes can agree to disagree, but we have to respects others' way of life, other people's opinion, that we can discuss about everything, not argue, talking in order to generate ideas, information, positive energy.. To find the solution for all problems and dilemmas, make projects, succeed.</p>\n\n<p>Somehow it feels despair and uncertainty it should not be so, we are young, we have desire and we can change everything that we do not like.</p>\n\n<p>It is essential to connect, and I read that nothing brings people together as well as living a happy accident, if it is true, We, all\xa0 in this region, the Balkans, we have more opportunities to be close, strong and organized than anyone else in the world, everything we've been through good and bad, sometimes on opposite sides, unfortunately, but we survived, war and killing, and we must never repeat it, we also\xa0 sang and celebrated and rejoice together, it was perhaps more sadness and unhappiness, but if there is justice in life, in future we should have only lucky days, happiness. Good neighborly relations like friendship and trust builds, slowly and gradually, all that is good and valuable in life, takes time. First we need to forgive. Forgiveness is possible only with understanding, that is why this camp is super idea, to understand together what had happened, impartial, draw lessons from history, in order to continue, this time better, smarter.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is to make the world a better and more humane place, sustainable, use space in the best possible way, with full respect of nature and population needs, because that's the point of studying, find the best way to reconcile nature and society to meet human needs, give vision of the future, the objectives of the future development.</p>\n\n<p>Everything is connected and the problems must be considered as a system, If one part of the system does not work properly, it reflects on other parts of the system.</p>", u'post_id': 854, u'user_id': 3680, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-30 18:17:44', u'title': u'Other aspects of behavior patterns of humans'}, {u'content': u'<p>Reagent is a term\xa0used in chemistry to describe a process in which one determines a presence of a substance by sparking a chemical reaction with it.</p>\n\n<p>In Ghent, ReaGent is a space opened by enthusiasts of bioengineering in order to spark interest and passion for natural sciences among the citizens of the city.

Biology education is becoming outdated and we need students able to design the sustainable solutions of the future.\xa0The situation has been changing in the past years across Europe - many graduates, biology enthusiasts, opened biolabs equipped with instruments that they built themselves or that companies were giving away. Surprisingly, it\u2019s a rather common situation - for many of the businesses the costs of maintenance or even disposal of these sophisticated machines is higher than just giving them away to whomever would be interested to use it.</p>\n\n<p>I have been involved in ReaGent since over a year. The space offers both paid and unpaid access and program - the privileged ones fund this way free classes for poorer children. Part of the funding comes also from the memberships, which guarantee access to the lab 2 days a week.</p>\n\n<p>Places like ReaGent spark creativity in sciences by working in an accessible, open and flexible manner. Their mission now is to give access to this type of education to the whole of Flanders, and extend their network by inviting for example designers to come and create biodegradable materials.</p>\n\n<p>As OPENandchange allied, ReaGent would bring about the same qualities to the application: they would bring scientific education, which in turn would be used in innovation and hacking applicable in care.</p>\n\n<p>If you have advice or\xa0another project which is relevant, let\'s discuss it here. A question to get the discussion going: what is the fairest way in the long term to\xa0fund\xa0education outside of, but\xa0as an addition to, the traditional state-funded system\xa0- from who\xa0and how?</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://reagentlab.org/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://reagentlab.org/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="/t/openvillage/788"></a></p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284.png" class="lightbox" title="banner_0.png"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284_1_690x85.png" width="690" height="85"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">banner_0.png</span><span class="informations">728x90 28.5 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p></p>', u'post_id': 715, u'user_id': 3362, u'timestamp': u'2016-08-09 21:14:46', u'title': u'ReaGent: Bringing quality biology education to every child equally'}, {u'content': u'<h2>\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0#PlantAtreeChallengeBD \u2013 Iffat-E-Faria</h2><div>\xa0</div>\n\n<p>On September 8<sup>th</sup> 2016, I have initiated an online campaign called \xa0<span class="hashtag">#PlantAtreeChallengeBD</span>\u201d The reason behind this was very simple. A country like Bangladesh, which is constantly facing threats of so many kinds of natural disaster, is being increasingly ignorant about its natural conservation. This country has only 17% of forests within. This by the way is getting narrower. Even the largest mangrove forest Sundarbans, which is an internationally recognized world heritage site, is also facing terrible manmade disasters and constant environmental pollutions. It has reached such a zenith, that the global-ecosystem is threatened with the loss of a majority of all species, by the end of this century. Everyone knows, but some chose to ignore it, some choose to remain silent about it. But I thought the simplest solution to address this problem is just plant more trees. It\u2019s a simple yet most productive solution to involve the youth, who first of all should be concerned about it; secondly should take initiatives to mitigate this problem. The idea to run an online campaign came to me due to the massive participation of youth in social media. My goals were very simple, engaging the youth to talk about the problem or at least make them realize how important it is to address the issue. Secondly, mobilize my community to take an initiative in real space so that they feel the necessity to do something about this particular problem.</p>\n\n<p>Along with few friends, I started inviting people over facebook to join the event. All they had to do is plant 5 trees and nominate 5 other friends on facebook to replicate the same. This way it will work like a chain reaction and we will be able to see a huge number of trees getting planted in a short period of time. The campaign is still going on and more people are joining. I know it has not gone viral and the number is not that high. Because in reality if you want to mobilize your community for a good cause, you have to ensure some motivations for them. Social norms are something that people tend to follow. Online campaign is there to help create a buzz, to create an objective. Which means if someone can bring out the movement from online space to offline, it moves faster and better. This is exactly why I have planned to run this campaign both online and offline.</p>\n\n<p>Primarily I even offered few things extra to carry on with the campaign. Since I am an online based entrepreneur and I have a client tale which is 3 years old, we kind of have a personal trust relationship with each \xa0other. So I personally offered my clients, I\'ll plant trees on behalf of them for every sell worth $10.</p>\n\n<p>To bring the campaign to reality, a part of that plan involves talking to the civil society and involving them. Therefore, we are in touch with mayor\u2019s office to propose an idea to tell the citizens, if they plants 5 trees, they\'ll get a discount on their TAX. The CEO\u2019s of top notch companies to take part in this initiative where we want them to initiate a tree plantation program as a part of their CSR activities. Encourage their employees to plant trees so that they can get a better record at the end of the year in the ACR. We\'ve asked the Headmasters of local schools to run the campaign along with the students, whoever plants more trees and takes care of them properly, will get an excellence award &amp; certificate from the school. Recently our PM received the award of CHAMPION of the Earth for her outstanding initiative on\xa0increasing forests and going green. I am simply trying to follow her path to make a change. Because I believe, OXYGEN is the most needed thing on earth and one can not simply buy a healthy environment with money. It takes proper plan and interest to create a land full of trees and a lot of patient. I got inspired by watching BHUTAN be the very first carbon negative country. </p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/187a482ab6f00199e06702f93d59eb7ded464999" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/187a482ab6f00199e06702f93d59eb7ded464999.jpg" class="lightbox" title="tree.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/187a482ab6f00199e06702f93d59eb7ded464999_1_666x500.jpg" width="666" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">tree.jpg</span><span class="informations">960x720 87.5 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>There is a chinese proverb saying \' The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is now. \' So, I believe in trying for a good cause.

As a Belgian citizen, I can get the best care for next to zero financial cost for myself. Though, what is mainly just a nuisance for me, can be dramatic for those in more precarious situations. Those here outside the healthcare system and those in areas with weaker or no social security.</p>\n\n<p><a href="/t/call-for-open-science-and-citizen-science-protagonists-how-do-we-build-ourselves-fairer-and-more-inclusive-healthcare/6248">The track I curate</a>\xa0at the festival investigates the role\xa0science and research can play in a more resilient care system. Specifically we will zoom in on open science and citizen science in all their forms, and learn from real-life projects.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exploring the ecosystem</strong></p>\n\n<p>The past weeks have been an exploration of what is out there, which you don\'t get to do nearly enough when buried deep in your own project. It was a period of trying to spot connections, common issues and creative solutions. Talking to people and connecting them to each other. Outreach has been difficult at times. Being too busy truly is a sign of our times, all the more so for people exploring new ways. Things take time at the edge.</p>\n\n<p>The people that I did have the pleasure to speak with, however, proved that there is a plethora of possible solutions, and challenges. Among them are an interdisciplinary researcher stewarding data on <a href="http://futurefootwear.org/">walking mechanics for indigenous communities</a>\xa0and an activist developing a way for individuals to\xa0<a href="https://fourthievesvinegar.org/our-mission">manufacture their own medications</a>. They have issues with legal battles and attracting talent, respectively.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Biohacking Valhalla</strong></p>\n\n<p>In mid May I attended the <a href="/t/learning-about-sustainable-biohackerspaces-at-biofabbing-convergence-2017/6287">BioFabbing Convergence</a>. Many European biohackers, citizen scientists and experts gathered in CERN, Geneva at Ideasquare. The conversations I had and the presentations I attended offered insight into running community science spaces, education and science activism on the edges.</p>\n\n<p>Among participants, plans were made to take concrete action towards improving citizen science practices, one of which is the\xa0<a href="https://github.com/DIYScience/DIYScience">DIY Science Network</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>\n\n<p>Challenges I\u2019ve faced have been time related. Between being ill, crisis management for own projects and working with people scarce on time, getting concrete things done is difficult. It goes to show that being active in the fields that we are, does also mean being more vulnerable to factors outside of your control.</p>\n\n<p>Going from interesting conversations in real life to stories on the platform, has also proven difficult. The Edgeryders platform is, quote, \u201chard to navigate or have an overview\u201d. We have noticed the same with people participating in the <a href="/t/open-insulin-research-group/787">Open Insulin research</a>. Part of the solution is getting a hang of it, another part are improvements to how people navigate the site, which the Edgeryders team is constantly doing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Next up</strong></p>\n\n<p>There have been inspiring stories on the platform already for a while, some of which I have reached out to and will assist in drafting a session proposal over the next weeks. The community calls are a nice way to connect with everyone and discuss new ideas.</p>\n\n<p>After the community call of earlier today, the first sessions should be ready for scheduling over the next week. Additionally, I\u2019ll be getting more external people into the existing discussions, and inviting more people to share stories and session proposals.</p>\n\n<p>Any help with the latter is welcome: if you know of any inspiring people active in the field, let\u2019s get in touch!</p>\n\n<p><em><b>This blogpost has been realised as part of the OpenCare Community Fellowship Program with the support of SCImPULSE Foundation.</b></em></p>', u'post_id': 6371, u'user_id': 3362, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-31 18:51:52', u'title': u'My first month as an OpenCare Community Fellow'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 856, u'user_id': 3681, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-30 22:25:12', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p>Food Security for All .......</p>\n\n<p>1- Training\xa0</p>\n\n<p>2- Capacity Building\xa0</p>\n\n<p>3- Open Discussion\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 6369, u'user_id': 3682, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-30 23:10:26', u'title': u'Sustainable Food Production'}, {u'content': u'<p>I grew up in Thessaloniki but always had a deep want to travel, see and live in other places. Which I did. My sporadic encounters with my native Greece always brought to mind the lyrics from a\xa0<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQxpBseJINY" rel="nofollow noopener">famous Greek song</a>\xa0which I shall badly try to translate here:</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cOh Hellas I love you,</em></p>\n\n<p>and I thank you deeply,</p>\n\n<p>for you taught me and I know</p>\n\n<p>how to breathe wherever I find myself,</p>\n\n<p>how to die with every step I take</p>\n\n<p>and how to just not be able to stand you\u201d</p>\n\n<p>These words are the preface for my MBA thesis for which I had to interact with Greek officials -and hence got a first hand experience of the stagnant and chaotic ways of its bureaucracy.</p>\n\n<p>Greece is a place of extreme and diverse beauty, almost 1/3 is under Natura protection. Within such a small geographical place there is a dose of everything (apart maybe from glaciers): snowy mountaintops for skiing, desert-like dunes, volcanic islands, prehistoric forests and countless hot springs! It feeds your soul with joy, light and clarity and you see why the term philosophy was coined up here. On the other hand, interaction with the system and the people can drive you mad in nanoseconds.</p>\n\n<p>In late 2010, I had been on the road for the best part of a year, not keeping track of politics and news and had missed the handing over of the country to the IMF and the banksters. One day I heard someone say: \u2018Oh you\u2019re Greek! My condolences: your country has gone bankrupt and is in tatters\u2019..(!).. So, I thought I\u2019d check back a bit and see what goes on.</p>\n\n<p>Especially after the 2004 Olympics every time I was back I felt \u2018like a fly in a glass of milk\u2019 as we say in Greek, like I do not fit in. It was as if they\u2019d all undergone mass hypnosis; everything was new, shiny, posh and expensive; credit cards arriving in the mail without having applied for one; people, euphoric and dull-eyed, going on constant shopping sprees. I felt like I was in a twilight zone surrounded by consumerist zombies!</p>\n\n<p>When I went back \xa0a few weeks later, two things happened: a. the country was not in ruins as I was led to believe: people were out shopping and had food on their table, public transport was regular, water and electricity were still there, as were public hospitals (none of which is the same nowadays). But something was brewing, brooding even. Which leads us to b. something was different\u2026 I couldn\u2019t exactly put my finger on it, but something was a-changing.</p>\n\n<p>The proof came in May 2011 and the infamous \u2018indignation\u2019 or \u2018occupy the squares\u2019 movement. I was there from the very first day, and although it was very amateuristic and problematic in various levels (and has been widely exploited for political gain) still, it was a strong, life-changing experience for most of us involved. I had never before (except from history books) seen Greeks come together in such ways and with such plurality and diversity. God-fearing pensioners working alongside young budding anarchists; apolitical housewives and disillusioned political-party members, all stepping out and taking initiative, organising, sharing openly their feelings and their food, showing solidarity, standing hand-in-hand to face the teargas and police brutality... The zombies had a heart!</p>\n\n<p>The next cornerstone came in August 2011 when I was fortunate enough to be part of the Greek delegation for the\xa0<a href="https://vimeo.com/37734507" rel="nofollow noopener">first Nyeleni Forum on European Food Sovereignty</a>. That was it for me. I decided to stay. And help. With all my strength. Since then, I dedicated myself and all my resources to bringing about change -and what a ride it\u2019s been! I can honestly say that I have never before worked as hard and with such persistence -even when I was working for a paycheck! Of course that meant many sacrifices on my part and a complete change of lifestyle as I immersed myself in the gift economy and found out how it is to have your needs met without money being the first resort.</p>\n\n<p>Since then I got involved with and instigated the creation of various groups, collectives, anti-privatisation initiatives etc. In October 2011 I co-organised the first Greek meeting on Food Sovereignty. In 2014 I organised the Permaculture Caravan -roaming the country for six weeks with Permaculturist <a href="http://www.livingincircles.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Peter Cow</a> spreading the ideas of autonomy and self sustainability and creating a new hype for Permaculture around the country. I joined \u2018Neighbourhoods In Action\u2019 -a group of eco-activists that managed to get elected in local government council of Thessaloniki -and played an important role in our municipality signing the\xa0<a href="http://www.milanurbanfoodpolicypact.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Milan Urban Food Policy Pact</a>\xa0for the creation of Food Policy Councils. I am currently trying to put our municipality in the\xa0<a href="http://www.agroecocities.eu/" rel="nofollow noopener">European Network for Cities for Agroecology</a>, and I am the focal point for Greece -ie contact person, for the\xa0<a href="http://nyelenieurope.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">European Food Sovereignty Movement</a>\xa0and\xa0<a href="http://urgenci.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">URGENCI -the Community Supported Agriculture Movemen</a>t.</p>\n\n<p>I am interested in creating a new agricultural production model, focusing on agroecology and self-sufficiency and I believe we need to pursue the transition to a new way of thinking and living. We live in a time of confluence where the old and the new are still co-existing and that creates a very challenging atmosphere, so people need support, tools and skills to make it through.</p>\n\n<p>We need to get involved with things like Community Supported Agriculture (CSA); sharing risks, responsibilities and rewards between growers and eaters of food, creating a new concept of human relationships, and new kinds of communities. Out of the ten million inhabitants of Greece almost half live in the area around Athens and one in Thessaloniki. There are whole regions -especially in the mountainous parts of the country, filled with ghost towns. The cities are dying due to the continuous austerity packs that suffocate entrepreneurship and chances of finding work. We need to revive rural areas by promoting small-scale agriculture, empowering farmers and inspiring rural lifestyle, by combining traditions and technology, and promote an economy based on social solidarity and alternative currencies. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>This is also, in its heart, a political issue: we need to emancipate ourselves as political beings, as citizens and as consumers and we need to create a new way for governing and caring for our societies and be responsible custodians of the abundance of nature for ourselves and all other species and for the generations to come. \xa0\xa0</p>\n\n<p>*For my take on the crisis as a \u201cvirtual crisis\u201d and what it means for our food, please watch my\xa0<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NzDEBOeSWQ" rel="nofollow noopener">short speech</a>\xa0during\xa0<a href="http://solikon2015.org/en" rel="nofollow noopener">Solikon Berlin</a>\xa0(The Solidarity Economy European Congress 2015) last year.</p>\n\n<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="8NzDEBOeSWQ" data-youtube-title="Food in an economy in crisis - the Greek paradigm Solikon Berlin \'15 English/Greek" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>\n\n<p>If you are unaware of what Food Sovereignty is all about you can watch\xa0<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7k2wnkt1sw" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>.</p>\n\n<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="R7k2wnkt1sw" data-youtube-title="European Food Sovereignty Movement at AlterSummit2013" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>\n\n<p>So if all of this sounds interesting, if you feel the urge to get involved, or if you have information and contacts that can help, please contact me to join forces <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>To see what I am currently involved in and all the exciting things we are creating at present in Greece and around Europe, please follow <a href="/t/from-eco-activism-to-food-sovereignty-and-beyond/527">this link</a></p>\n\n<p><em>The production of this article was supported by\xa0<a href="/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296">Op3n Fellowships</a>\xa0- an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.</em></p>', u'post_id': 559, u'user_id': 3417, u'timestamp': u'2016-12-14 12:52:14', u'title': u'Crisis?

A guided digital diary can be very helpful in a case like histamine intolerance where the combination of foods, cooking and food preservation, as well as lifestyle, and environmental conditions, all play a great role, in an intricate and complex combination. Histamine intolerance has been chosen as a concrete case to work with because it\'s a health condition I suffer from myself and for which I would like to have a tool that helps me deal with it.

Back there I found a guy that told me about this movement: the biohacking. Basically, a bunch of tinkerers started to use their garages as biotechnology laboratories with the aim to make those biological technologies available to everyone.</p>\n\n<p>From that moment I started a path that led me to follow many movements and initiatives that are trying to create alternatives to existing power infrastructures.</p>\n\n<p>My name is Damiano Avellino, I\'m 24 years old. I\u2019m one of the founders of Fairbnb and of other non-profit initiatives that seek to create a more inclusive and fair society.</p>\n\n<p>During my years at the University, where I studied biotechnology, my curiosity was fed by great Professors during the day and by biohackers geeks on the internet during the night.</p>\n\n<p>My first attempt to create a biohacker space dates at my freshman year, as you can imagine the excitement of my colleagues vanished due to the pressure of our studies and the difficulty of the journey.</p>\n\n<p>The problem wasn\u2019t related to the goodness of the project, both other colleagues and professors seemed thrilled by the idea of having an open source lab for biotechnology. What stopped the initiative was the lack of support and guidance from existing organizations incapable of grasping and helping to fund new ideas.</p>\n\n<p>In general, there\u2019s a tendency for new initiatives to struggle in the initial fundraising. It\u2019s easier to get funded if you are already big or active enough.</p>\n\n<p>If you have applied for any grant, you know how competitive these things can be, and</p>\n\n<p>probably you understand how the abundances of projects and the lack of funding</p>\n\n<p>tend to lower the diversity of the ecosystems and sometimes discourage innovative ideas - This doesn\u2019t apply to for-profit start-ups that can rely on other types of financial support (VC, Business angels, etc) -.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, this part of my story is not what I\u2019m here to write about.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m here to write about emerging opportunities we have to finance bottom up initiatives, that are not exploiting, related to a viable strategy to transform existing sharing economy platforms in a mechanism to perpetually fund non-profit projects and grassroots initiatives.</p>\n\n<p>This story is about an ongoing project that could pilot a new model of sharing economy that by succeeding could lead to the flourish of a new collaborative economy.</p>\n\n<p>Fairbnb is in an early stage, we didn\u2019t launch the beta yet, but I\u2019m convinced for some reasons that I will briefly explain at the end, that it represents a huge opportunity to change the digital economy.</p>\n\n<p>Why should we attempt to change the digital economy?</p>\n\n<p>Well, during the last ten years our economy has\xa0been completely \u201cplatformed\u201d: the largest taxi company doesn\u2019t own any cars\xa0(Uber), the world\u2019s biggest media owner creates no content (Facebook) and so on. In almost every sectors a single player with a \u201cplatform business model\u201d dominates.</p>\n\n<p>There are two main problems with this:</p>\n\n<p>1) Platforms that succeed are the best for investors not for users\xa0 (the growth is achieved thanks to massive investments), therefore are extractive, so Amazon takes % on the little bookstore sales, Airbnb takes % on your house, etc.</p>\n\n<p>2) Platforms tend to become a natural monopoly due to the network effect.</p>\n\n<p>(I\u2019m not mentioning how we lost our privacy and the possibility to have control over\xa0the data that we generate because it could lead us too far)</p>\n\n<p>My intention to create an alternative to this model grew with time and thanks to some precise experiences.</p>\n\n<p>I firstly became interested in platforms thanks to Eugenio Battaglia (Platform Design Toolkit) with whom I share the passion for biohacking.</p>\n\n<p>He gave me the Pentagrowth report and fulfilled my head with other absorbing materials and thoughtful conversations that shaped my platform thinking.</p>\n\n<p>The second crucial event happened last year when I was selected to participate in the Global Changemakers summit.</p>\n\n<p>The rough idea that was floating in my mind, since probably a couple of years, had the chance to become a real project.</p>\n\n<p>The idea to use part of the money generated by our online activities to redistribute wealth to local projects as an opposite model to the present one, that uses part of the wealth generated by our online activities to enrich billionaires, was simple and not probably not even that original.</p>\n\n<p>But the fact that I had to attend a summit with 60 young activists all very influential in their communities and from all over the world gave me the chance to think concretely about a model for a particular platform that relies on crowdsourcing, and that could work.</p>\n\n<p>The event took place in June 2016; there I brought the rough idea of a project called Solbnb (Solidaritybnb).</p>\n\n<p>Since then the project merged with two other initiatives, which were also trying to create an alternative to Airbnb in Amsterdam and Barcelona, under the name of Fairbnb. Nine co-founders from five different countries and with an age range that goes from 24 to 50 are working together to build the platform along with a growing community.</p>\n\n<p>The platform with shared ownership and control will be non-extractive, inclusive and cooperative.</p>\n\n<p>The peer2peer accommodation market produces every year more than 1.5 billion dollars of revenues (the extracted part).</p>\n\n<p>If Fairbnb will be able to take even a little share of the market, an incredible number of non-profit initiatives could be funded.</p>\n\n<p>We want to use as little as possible of the revenues to keep up the platform and give back the majority of this money to communities through local projects thanks to a crowdfunding-like mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>If we succeed thousands biohackers spaces, social streets, art exhibitions, solidarity initiatives, refugees projects, etc. could be funded.</p>\n\n<p>As Janella Orsi highlight in this article <a href="https://goo.gl/0XK6Nu" rel="nofollow noopener">https://goo.gl/0XK6Nu</a>\xa0 \u201cThat rumored $20 billion company valuation relies largely on the loyalty of users. Like I said, thin air.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Yes.. a non-extractive P2P accommodation platform most likely is the best opportunity that we have to pilot a new model of sharing economy that could produce positive externalities at an unprecedented scale.</p>', u'post_id': 829, u'user_id': 3605, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-05 20:40:47', u'title': u'How sharing economy platforms could power a new collaborative economy'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hi everyone!</p>\n\n<p>This Wednesday I will be hosting the meeting for the OpenInsuline project and I myself would like to\xa0focus on the outreach, as started in <a href="/t/open-insulin-educational-outreach/6201">this post</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I\'d like to think with you\xa0about three things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>An educational\xa0<strong>activity</strong><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>An awareness\xa0<strong>artwork</strong>, as proposed by Maria during the <a href="/t/insulin-diabetes-situation-in-belgium-team-meeting-notes-26-04-2017/6245">26.04 meeting</a><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Visualisation as <a href="/t/infographics-for-the-open-insulin-project/6244">proposed </a>by <a class="mention" href="/u/scigrades">@Scigrades</a>, which should tie in with what we want to accomplish with the previous two</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>A couple of people made the case for prevention, with <a class="mention" href="/u/gls9000">@GLS9000</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/alberto">@Alberto</a> making some great points, which I think is important as well and very relevant for this topic.

When I hear myself describe to them what we do in our courses (like dressing up and dancing around cardboard sculptures of alien Christmas trees), I sometimes find it difficult to take myself seriously. However, as most people that work in a creative field would probably tell you, it really is stressful. Being creative is intense. Apart from the financial uncertainty and competitiveness that tend to run in these professions, the work itself is very demanding, mentally and emotionally. It is very easy to become personally invested in a project, some might even call this is a necessity. Because they are so closely intertwined, it is often difficult to separate between the professional and the personal. How does this affect the way we deal with issues of mental and emotional wellbeing in this context?</p>\n\n<p>In Product Design, we are constantly brought to question our surroundings, our decisions, and most importantly, ourselves. There has been a crisis point in almost any project where this turned into seriously doubting myself and hating all the work I had done. Sometimes, it led to absolute public meltdowns. To me it is a strange and uncomfortable feeling to share such intimate moments with people I work with.</p>\n\n<p>Many of my friends that study creative subjects have told me about similar experiences in their lives, particularly about struggles with insecurity and stress of varying degrees. Are these emotional strains simply an occupational hazard that we as creatives have to accept? Are they something we should embrace, something we actually need to produce meaningful work? There seems to be a romanticized idea of the tragically ailed, mad genius, based on the stories of countless artists like van Gogh or Beethoven that produced some of their best work during periods of Depression or Hypomania. Joshua Walters proposes in his Ted Talk \u2018On being just crazy enough\u2019, that those suffering from mental conditions might just be more sensitive to the world than others and that we can use our \u2018skillness\u2019 to our advantage. Many scientific studies suggest in fact, that there is a link between creativity and mental illness. One theory is that those with strong creative inclination perceive the world with a heightened awareness and tend to be more reflective and ruminate in their thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>For me, a host of questions and problematics arise out of this. How do these factors influence people in creative fields in reaching out when in distress? At what point does these different pressures stop aiding creativity and start impeding it?

The few studies that have been conducted reflect a medical rather than a social model of disability, and they are also limited in geographical coverage. While no reliable national data exist, anecdotal information and a number of micro studies generally suggest a disability prevalence rate of between 5 to 12 per cent. This is close to the WHO estimate, which states that 10 per cent of any given population can be considered to have some or other form of disability.</p>\n\n<p>Ignorance and wrong beliefs surrounding disability, compounded with a negative and derogatory attitude of the community (including family members) have contributed to the marginal development in the disability sector in Bangladesh.</p>\n\n<p>As Bangladesh makes progress in implementing its health policies on infant mortality rate, immunization coverage, and general health care, there is likely a lowering of incidence of disabilities. However, the gains due to improved health care can be outweighed by the triple effects of increased number of surviving children with disabilities, increased number of people incurring disabilities due to old age (e.g., cataracts and arthritis), and widespread malnutrition. Disabilities due to natural calamities and road traffic accidents imply that the prevalence of people having disabilities in Bangladesh is likely to continually rise over-time, although the nature and distribution of disabilities are also likely to change considerably.</p>", u'post_id': 840, u'user_id': 3617, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-17 17:25:00', u'title': u'Persons with Disabilities Health Care System in Bangladesh'}, {u'content': u'<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/7f174772e103442c0c234aaac3de3aeb6954836e" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7f174772e103442c0c234aaac3de3aeb6954836e.jpg" class="lightbox" title="gael_3.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/7f174772e103442c0c234aaac3de3aeb6954836e_1_690x355.jpg" width="690" height="355"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">gael_3.jpg</span><span class="informations">812x418 138 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Tell us what you are doing to get #openvillage tickets, fellowships and more!</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>What is it that creates the conditions for an environment of open care?\xa0Gehan Macleod proposes a session at OpenVillage to tackle an important question\xa0that goes beyond the field of preventative\xa0or wellness\xa0care by asking<strong>\xa0</strong>"how do we understand the architectures of love that are called for to create a more care-full society?"</p>\n\n<p>Gehan is the co-founder of\xa0<a href="http://www.galgael.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the GalGael Trust</a>,\xa0an organisation of social solidarity based in Glasgow, Scotland.

The aim is to focus on reducing\xa0the number of inpatients over fifty years of age with entering the hospital with preventable ailments such as heart disease, high cholesterol, dementia, and lung cancer.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The hospital is based\xa0in The Liberties in Dublin, which got its name in the 12th century due to its location just outside Dublin City\'s walls \u2013 lands united with the city, but still keeping their own jurisdiction (hence "liberties"). The area\'s history is still very relevant to the health of its residents.</p>\n\n<p>Being outside the city walls, the Liberties became a hub for trade and craftsmen. The 19th century saw the Liberties become dominated by large brewing and distilling families, most notably Guinness who built the world\'s largest brewery there. With this industrial wealth, however, came dire poverty and slum living conditions. Today the Liberties\xa0is a city neighbourhood of opportunities and innovation, but its history -\xa0positive and negative -\xa0pervades. Although having undergone much urban regeneration as well as gentrification,\xa0the Liberties still embodies that juncture between being a centre for enterprise and commercial life as well as being home to large blocks of inner city social housing. Homelessness, drug use, and lower than average life expectancy are some of the problems facing\xa0in the Liberties today.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>On researching in the area first-hand, it was observed that there was a distinct lack of male presence in local community centres, as well as a high number of men drinking alone in pubs. The Liberties Local Health project draws on this observation to engage those lone drinkers to become members of a local brewing club, where beer is brewed by locals, for locals.</p>\n\n<p>The\xa0project takes its inspiration from the highly successful Men\u2019s Sheds mental health initiative whose\xa0motto is, \u201cmen don\u2019t talk face to face, they talk shoulder to shoulder.\u201d</p>\n\n<h2>HOW?</h2>\n\n<p>The\xa0brewing club for men over fifty\xa0in the locality \u2013 where they create a low percentage beer brewed by locals,\xa0for locals \u2013\xa0harnesses existing local\xa0skill sets of the hundreds of Guinness factory retirees.</p>\n\n<p>The brewing club, "Sl\xe1inte", takes it name from the Irish word for "cheers", also meaning "health". The aim of the club is to\xa0encourage\xa0more responsible drinking through\xa0appreciation of the brewing process\xa0as well as forming a sense of pride and comradery among members. The project was commended by health industry professionals after its presentation at Dublin\u2019s Active Age Conference 2012.</p>\n\n<p>With Ireland\'s craft beer market having hit\xa0\u20ac59 million in 2016 (up form \u20ac40 million in 2015) and volumes of beer from Irish microbreweries having increased by 415% between 2011 and 2015, the brewing club "Sl\xe1inte" has high viability potential to run itself as a social enterprise overseen by members, bringing with it a sense of pride, achievement, and overall better health.</p>\n\n<h2>USER JOURNEY</h2>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dd361a63824dc6e19fe7d83dc61f46d515f79c50.jpg" width="359" height="359"></p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/9b74a859e676a3e65e6e7afa003b2a6b44ff054f" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9b74a859e676a3e65e6e7afa003b2a6b44ff054f.png" class="lightbox" title="beere mat transparent background.png"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/9b74a859e676a3e65e6e7afa003b2a6b44ff054f_1_326x500.png" width="326" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">beere mat transparent background.png</span><span class="informations">676x1035 626 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/9/94f2187eedd5d9a35e15813d26a8ec5c45166096.jpg" width="359" height="359"></p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ece33b3009554b15663978f6e3cc49df1b609f96.jpg" width="359" height="359"></p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/3/329625617090118f77695ae38b28b669755dae36.jpg" width="359" height="359"></p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dd18f4dd2a0e694571e4450578dd303694181075.jpg" width="359" height="359"></p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f45f64516c04c5332ccb37de51c76cf2f341cbe9.jpg" width="359" height="359"></p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/6/663d2845f71ead42f85d647d11f962cac9955f32.png" width="500" height="500"></p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8a1d10494efc3fc1b05fe1adf5fe56369adc7171.jpg" width="516" height="346"></p>', u'post_id': 841, u'user_id': 3649, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-16 11:40:16', u'title': u'Liberties Local Health Project'}, {u'content': u'<p>Access to potable water is a severe and increasingly pressing health issue for many countries.

Due to a confluence of factors including overuse, population growth and climate change, an estimated two-thirds of the world\u2019s population will be living in water-stressed areas by 2025. One recent innovation that could potentially revolutionize water purification in poor, rural communities is the MadiDrop.</p>\n\n<p>The MadiDrop is a porous ceramic disc that has been infused with silver or copper. When dropped in water, the tablet releases ionic silver or copper that strips away bacteria and pathogens to produce clean, drinkable water. Each tablet is capable of treating 10 to 20 litres of water for up to six months. The result is an affordable, easily distributable and long-lasting alternative for families who lack access to a safe, potable water source.</p>\n\n<p>The MadiDrop is the second water treatment technology developed by PureMadi, an organization formed by a group of interdisciplinary students from the University of Virginia. Their first project was the creation of a ceramic water filter factory in South Africa. The filters use local labour, readily available materials (clay, sawdust and water) and are treated with a dilute solution of silver nano-particles that effectively filter out common waterborne pathogens. The PureMadi ceramic filters were designed to create a cheap and sustainable point-of-use water purification solution for low-income households. To date, they have been well-received and highly effective among families in Limpopo province, South Africa.</p>\n\n<p>The impetus for the MadiDrop was to apply this successful model to create an even cheaper point-of-use water treatment technology. The MadiDrop can be used in a variety of water storage containers, and at only a few dollars per drop, can provide families with purified water for an extended period of time. Lab results look promising but extensive field testing is still required to determine whether the MadiDrop is a sustainable and culturally appropriate solution. With any luck, the MadiDrop will eventually be widely used to improve clean water access and curb the spread of waterborne diseases in low-income communities.</p>', u'post_id': 710, u'user_id': 3279, u'timestamp': u'2016-07-31 22:10:07', u'title': u'An Affordable, Easy-to-Use Water Purification Tablet'}, {u'content': u'<p>Welcome!</p>\n\n<p>This is the team for you If you want to discover great people and promising projects, help get their message out into the world, and help draw support to their work.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>We are mainly interested in people, projects and places that help us to reimagine how we care for one another in the 21st century.

The Malagasy people seem to have lost the desire to resist standing up to defend their rights, even though they are being trampled on a daily basis. According to statistics, 92% of Malagasy lived below the poverty threshold but no one rose up. When social pressure is too much, the point of rupture is not far, and the accumulation of frustration and deprivation often results in bloody explosions. However, this can be avoided. Just put yourself to nonviolent civil resistance! Nowadays, the Malagasy people are tired of going down to the streets to claim their rights as citizens. Why make the strike if it is to have each time the same scenario: Teaser bombs, lost bullets and blood flowing, as was the case in 1972, 2002, or in 2009? Why manifesting because it is the politicians who benefit in the end? Today, people prefer to stay at home and rant about the social network instead of expressing their frustration in public and questioning their leaders. And yet, it is not the subjects of contestation which are wanting. Traffics of all kinds, corruption, bad governance, lack of accountability of elected officials, non-respect of laws, hamper development of the country. It is now essential that the Malagasy rediscover that power belongs to them and that they learn how to fight against injustice, without dilatory maneuvering of the politicians, and without violence. As Martin Luther King Jr pointed out, active nonviolence is not a method for cowards. On the contrary, it is a real resistance. It is the art of using non-violent power to achieve sociopolitical objectives, especially through symbolic protests. This practice was popularized from 1921 by exemplary personalities like Gandhi in India, by Nelson Mandela and Steve Biko in South Africa, or Martin Luther King Jr in his fight against segregation. The Malagasy also experimented with nonviolent civil resistance, for example through publications in satirical journals under colonization, but the practice gradually lost face to the rise of the military and police repression, but Also facing the weariness of the main concerned - the citizens. Contemporary movements such as Wake-up Madagascar are now trying to awaken citizens\' consciences and to revive non-violent civil resistance. Short-lived symbolic actions that do not create crowds and are therefore not illegal are regularly organized to denounce the fact of society that make jasper. Expose empty plates to say that the Malagasy are hungry, to walk in the streets of Antananarivo to demand the ratification of a charter on democracy or to make the dead on the place of independence in the city center of the capital to denounce the words which undermine the country are for example, part of the non-violent civil resistance. It is precisely to spread this philosophy on the desire for change through non-violent actions that many projects such as LIANA or Learning Initiative Aiming at Non Violent Action which was initiated by Wake Up Madagascar, Liberty 32 and the WYLD program Women and Youth\'s League for Democracy with the support of the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict. Since the 70\'s during the 1st Republic in Madagascar, Malagasy people have been manipulate and influenced by politicians who wants a place on government by force.

And then match them another member, so that they can videochat in the weeks leading up to the OpenVillage. This way there is at least one familar face when they arrive!</p>\n\n<p>Are things like these already in the works? Or maybe there are contraints I don\'t know about?

How can we explore more of our loving and creative potential as well as create a world that reflects this inner beauty and love?\xa0</p>\n\n<p>These are two vital questions for me and why I\'m\xa0"Creating new realities". There\'s this beautiful play between the physical world and the non-physical (spiritual), which goes beyond words and at the same time can be very simple in heart. In my experience we are learning to trust and act upon our hearts\' desires and letting go of the certainties of the known. Learning to be fully into life and at the same time peacefully creating the life that\'s feels really good, often being unpredictable, confronting with new challenges along the way of growth. Yet, totally clear from another perspective, which is often only afterwards understood.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>To me there\'s roughly two aspects to creation, finding love and expressing it. In whatever way feels most relevant. So creating new realities is about this expression. Expressions of love, expressions of fascination, of being intrigued by a question. This passion, like life can often only be looked upon afterwards. Yet is highly stimulating during the process. At the same time, we can experience a deep peace from within. Growing and integrating. Expressing and being silent. Creating new realities requires both in my experience. Going into something, almost blindly. Being into the question, into life, almost unconsciously. Letting go of what I already know. And at the same time being fully aware of what\'s happening, even when I don\'t know where I\'m going. I\'m fully aware of what I\'m experiencing, all of the feelings and sensations, getting to know myself. To me, creating is about holding space and love, it\'s also about exploring new states of being. More expansive versions of myself. Going into the unknown. Creating new realities, riding the edges, exploring new perspectives, and at the same time, taking care of each other, holding space, accepting all of yourself and everyone around you. Knowing the lows to accept the others and overcoming doubt, finding highs to thrive and create a more amazing life.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>So can we\xa0do that?</p>\n\n<p>Create new realities and find deeper love within and for each other? Can we create and hold space? Can we set up a world that\'s a reflection of the love and creative potential? Can we shine light on some of the systems that enslave us (like the way money is used to control us) and create new systems that support the dynamics of our potential? Can we let go of heavy concepts and perceptions such as ownership? Can we create a world that\'s natural and harmonious, yet inspiring and unknown? Can we co-create out of passion rather than looking for security? Can we step into the unknown and create with love? So how do we deepen the understanding of ourselves and our behaviours? And more importantly, how can we let go of everything that doesn\'t serve us. Can we accelerate into loving ourselves? Which techniques can we use? Which perspectives can we take? And physically how can we create lifes that actually feel inspiring and authentic?</p>\n\n<p>Over the last years I\'ve been organizing several series of meetings about personal transformation and\xa0living from the heart\xa0(for instance;\xa0<a href="http://www.inderuimte.org/vrijmetgeld/" rel="nofollow noopener">Vrij met Geld</a>/ Free with Money). Also I\'ve worked and lived with changemakers communities, for instance at the <a href="http://synergyhub.nl/" rel="nofollow noopener">Synergyhub</a> in Rotterdam and several ecovillages/ ecocenter\'s, as well as intensely researched the topic of enlightenment and spiritual growth and the physical world. Over the last months I\'ve started writing a book: <a href="https://vimeo.com/213665086" rel="nofollow noopener">Step into creation - guidebook for a co-creative universe</a>. Recently I\'ve started a platform "<a href="http://creatingnewrealities.co/" rel="nofollow noopener">Creating new realities</a>". One of the important lessons I learned is: "you can\'t co-create if you don\'t resonate" and "a little shift in perspective" is often all you need to get back into flow. When I stop resisting, things happen. "<em>When I let go, I know</em>". Behind the known is a infinite field of potential. There lies true excitement. There is infinite inspiration at our disposal. And at the same time, it\'s nice to play with the physical. So to make the world a reflection of our spiritual growth. To let both go hand in hand. To grow and deepen the quality of relationships and communities. To develop the society and create things that represent our love for the world and the mystery of creation. These are some of my most important reflections over my experiences. That\'s what I\'d love to inspire and catalyze! To create realities that are infinitely inspiring and joyful.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Looking forward to co-create with you!</p>\n\n<p>Ewoud</p>', u'post_id': 846, u'user_id': 3643, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-19 10:27:39', u'title': u'Creating new realities'}, {u'content': u'<p>A new issue I could deal with, during these last weeks, has been the additive manufacturing (known by the most of us as 3D print).</p>\n\n<p>Part of the work at WeMake is done thanks to the 3d printers, machines that materialize objects from digital projects and templates. There are different types of 3D printers according to the type of material, process and size of manufacturing. The additive manufacturing is one of the most commons; the material i\'ve seen so far is a kind of plastic wire warmed and turned into layers added on a base on which in few hours any object can take shape. There are prototypes and test objects all over the scaffolds and tables. After a while you get used to such unusual presence and start to think of materializing by print whatever. Really.</p>\n\n<p>In the past week Costantino and I went to Fondazione Bassetti in Milan to listen to Professor Jos Malda from Utrecht University about <a href="http://www.fondazionebassetti.org/en/focus/2017/04/professor_jos_malda_in_milan_f.html" rel="nofollow noopener">3D printing in the biomedica sector</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, I could discuss with some of the makers about possibile uses of printing cells and what are the scenarios about it. We talked also about the possibility to print food.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to 3D printing everybody is open to discussion here.</p>\n\n<p>A meeting with Rune and other collaborators turned in a interesting discussion about including patients in the process of manufacturing hands, or prothesis to grab forks and spoons to make people who miss some fingers, the hand or an arm, autonomous with eating. There are so many different applications and by 3D print it seems a viable way to save costs and have a just in time do it yourself scalable production of whatever the patient needs.</p>\n\n<p>Of course there are many issues about copyright, legal implications, safety, patenting and certification.

I studied physics at university 8 years ago, but dropped out after the first year. The awe for physics and the mythical status of CERN did outlive\xa0my short-lived career as a physicst.</p>\n\n<p>Together with <a class="mention" href="/u/massimiliano">@Massimiliano</a> I went to the <a href="http://citizensciences.net/biofabbing/">Biofabbing Convergence</a> (tagline Fabrications &amp; Fabulations) . He was asked to give a presentation about his quest to understand DIYbio and brought me along to co-present some real life observations (and as his \'species\' <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ). A\xa0philospher doing a phd on synthetic biology, studying a phenomenon mainly studied by sociologists, Massimiliano is\xa0a bit out of place in many ways, making his perspective all the more interesting.</p>\n\n<p>The venue, <a href="http://ideasquare.web.cern.ch/">Ideasquare</a>, is the perfect setting for an event\xa0that\'s part\xa0academic conference, part unconference, part hackathon. I was happy to discover the latter two parts had the upper hand and that everyone that I met had an interesting story to tell as to why they were there.</p>\n\n<p>After arriving later than expected (we have much to learn about Swiss buses), we could join the first\xa0few short plenary sessions. Quickly though, everyone was invited to propose their own sessions or to join the hacking in one of the meeting rooms-turned-hacklabs.</p>\n\n<p>No time for that in my case, as over the short two days, I went from one interesting conversation to another. To be expected with such a high\xa0concentration of the most active biohackers in Europe and beyond. Discussing more inclusive education with Bethan from <a href="https://www.bento.bio/">Bento Lab</a> and open source, DIY medicine with Michael from <a href="https://fourthievesvinegar.org/">Four Thieves Vinegar</a>\xa0among others who are doing amazing things. It is certain: there is much to be learned from each other, and we should encourage this more.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href="/t/call-for-open-science-and-citizen-science-protagonists-how-do-we-build-ourselves-fairer-and-more-inclusive-healthcare/6248">OpenVillage Festival theme on citizen science</a>\xa0aims to do exactly that: learn from each other. On day 2 I presented the questions I had raised initially and our ways of tackling them with <a href="http://reagentlab.org/">ReaGent</a>, <a href="http://www.ekoli.be/">Ekoli</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.breakitdown.eu/">Break it Down</a>. The need to find answers was\xa0further confirmed by reactions, other presentations and conversations offline and online. Many communities have\xa0the same issues:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>How to sustain your lab space?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>How to sustain people?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>How to professionalize in a way that does not compromise values?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>How to work with institutions?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>How to distribute value in a fair way?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>It was not all seriousness and\xa0we ended exploring weird ideas like what to do with tonsils after they are removed (<a href="http://emutagen.com/index.html">Adam Zaretsky</a> gave me a detailed protocol after I asked him about how to make\xa0tonsil burgers; this was not even that far out there compared to the ideas\xa0he presented the next day) and laughing at the fact that someone is actually getting paid for\xa0<a href="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--rovqFOTm--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/1375900978169133965.jpg">jamming minced meat in lab glassware</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As I\'m writing this back in Belgium, the discussion is still going on at the event and on the online forum.

In the context of "Hacking Utopia", a human centered design project at the University of Arts Berlin, we are investigating mental health. This article explains our approach of boosting mental resilience and give you the chance to get involved in our project.</p>\n\n<p>In our previous contributions on Edgeryders we described how we started off with the question of making sadness, unproductivity and inefficiency less shameful. We discovered two TED talks that influenced us greatly: <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability" rel="nofollow noopener">The power of vulnerability</a> by Brene Brown and <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_solomon_depression_the_secret_we_share/transcript" rel="nofollow noopener">Depression, the secret we share</a> by Andrew Solomon. As later confirmed by the psychologists we interviewed, these talks made us understand that sharing our feelings is a key step towards mental resilience. Establishing a sustainable, personal connection this is necessary for recovery and growth. When we hide our condition, we ignore it, it becomes worse.</p>\n\n<p><strong>USER INTERVIEWS</strong></p>\n\n<p>The issue of mental health is especially important in the context of youth. Young adults are increasingly affected by issues like anxiety or depression. Their circumstances make them particularly susceptible to psychological stress. As many leave the familiar framework of home and school and move into an uncertain future, the newly independents have to find alternative support structures. New living situations, potentially in a new city or even country, starting university or a job, all these developments entail a multitude of mental pressures. In a time where social media is so influential, standards of self-representation are an added factor. According to one of the psychological guidance counsellors at Studentenwerk Berlin; stress, loneliness and self-image issues are very common results among many students.</p>\n\n<p>As part of our research, we interviewed several university students from different backgrounds about negative emotions like these. One question was how they handle situations of feeling sad, stressed or lonely. The main insight was that everyone experienced this shit, but no one liked to deal with it. A prominent theme in the conversations was the difficulty to talk about emotional problems \u2013 be it a missed project deadline, a loss in the family or an eating disorder. It was mentioned\xa0that it was easier for them to open up to someone who had similar problems and could empathize. However, it is difficult to identify the people that can offer support\xa0when everyone tries to hide their struggles.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, most people\xa0don\u2019t decide to seek help until they had been in increasing pain for a prolonged amount of time. Yet at this point of outreach, recovery is still far. As we learned from our interviews, it can take months to find care that is suitable to the individual and more months to see any progress. While there is a great spectrum of available options, the general idea of psychological treatment is still stigmatized. It is often not even perceived as a possible solution. The psychologists we interviewed mentioned that many of their patients came to them only after being referred by a general practitioner or friends who had tried therapy themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, we cannot force people to seek help. Keeping quiet about insecurities is a justified mental defence mechanism. When we share our feelings, we are vulnerable, exposed. Oftentimes, the recipient is simply not equipped to offer a good, empathic response. This could almost be described as a societal incompetence,\xa0stemming from a general lack of awareness.</p>\n\n<p><strong>OUR GOAL</strong></p>\n\n<p>We want\xa0to challenge the current attitude towards psychological care. Our project tries to de-stigmatize psychological pain and make the sensitive, \'taboo\' issue of mental health more present and approachable to the public. We believe that udnerstanding and empathy is vital to provide good care for people that are suffering from emotional distress. We want to make it clear\xa0that feeling shitty is nothing to be ashamed of, but actually a very common thing. Also, we want the impact of these feelings to be understandable, so that more people can offer informed, helpful responses. When this happens, the threshold of reaching out is lowered, which in return allows problems to be addressed before they develop into serious mental conditions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>INSPIRATION</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are a number of inspiring projects who deal with exactly this issue of awareness. One clever way artists are spreading awareness is over the internet. Tumblr users like <a href="http://rubyetc.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Rubyetc</a>, <a href="http://butthorn.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Beth Evans</a> or <a href="http://sarahcandersen.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Sarah\u2019s Scribbles</a> have gained quite a following with their funny, relatable comics about everyday struggles. Seeing that you are not alone in your suffering can be very comforting. Recently, illustrator Gemma Correll created a series of drawings as part of an online awareness campaign for Mental Health America to visualize what <a href="http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/feelslike" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="hashtag">#mentalillnessfeelslike</span></a>. Their campaign encourages people to open up about their conditions and harvest the power of sharing.</p>\n\n<p>A related approach can be found in the various devices that exist to simulate old age. Suits like <a href="http://www.age-simulation-suit.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">\u2018GERT\u2019</a> are designed to make the wearer feel the impairments that come with aging: stiffness and limited mobility, decreasing strength, blurred sight, muffled hearing. The concept was originally developed to enable caretakers of elderly people to better understand the needs and fears of their patients. Now, gadgets with similar effects, designed by students at Weimar University, are being exhibited at the Hygiene Museum in Dresden, allowing the public to gain the same understanding.\xa0\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In general, public exhibitions are a valuable source of inspiration when it comes to reaching people and conveying information. A prime example is the \'Happy Show\', set up by design firm Sagmeister &amp; Walsh. Verging somewhere between art and education, the show throughly explores the theme of happiness in a graphic, creative and interactive manner. Another show that encourages people to actively engage with the exhibit is Erwin Wurms \'Bei Mutti\'. Visitors are isntructed to interact the artefacts on display, effectively becoming a piece of the art themselves.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/c9da2d09617995e27fe23a6530e481a716fe9cae" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c9da2d09617995e27fe23a6530e481a716fe9cae.jpg" class="lightbox" title="f9e1fc54827667adbc6d98f8ac208de7_1.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c9da2d09617995e27fe23a6530e481a716fe9cae_1_690x388.jpg" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">f9e1fc54827667adbc6d98f8ac208de7_1.jpg</span><span class="informations">1920x1080 577 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>PROJECT PROPOSAL</strong></p>\n\n<p>In order to achieve our goal we propose a combination of an interactive exhibition and an information booth. This pop-up stall can easily be set up at universities events like open days and conferences.</p>\n\n<p>We will exhibit various sadness simulators, wearable objects for the crowd to try which simulate the effects of being depressed, stressed or anxious. These objects have been inspired by an online survey we have conducted in order to find out how people physically feel when they are in emotional distress. Out of dozens of responses we have extracted the most common themes: weight on the shoulders, head pulling down, brain fog and a general discomfort in one\'s body feeling: hot, sticky and itchy. With these results we have designed various objects: A neck bender, a very heavy device to carry on his back being forced to lean forward. A helmet made of tinted transparent acrylic that simulates looking through a veil and muffles the sound of the surroundings and a really uncomfortable ill-fitting coat made of a super itchy and stiff fabric. We have more ideas but for now we have realized these three.</p>\n\n<p>Those who are\xa0brave enough to test our simulators will receive a positive feedback. They will get to choose between 3 gifts: Stickers that encourage everyday task such as: "got out of bad", "took a shower" and "washed my laundry" in order to demonstrate how difficult these tasks can be to certain people. They could also choose comforting cynical tea bags that they can grant a friend in need on a rainy day or shit shaped chocolate pralines to compensate for the horrors they have just been through. The exhibition will also include an interactive board in which participants can share their feelings caused by the simulators or just generally and a second board presenting useful information regarding mental issues: how to identify, approachable treatments, support groups and other solutions. The first exhibition will take place during Berlin University of the Arts Semester end\'s exhibition and we hope it will continue to other universities around berlin and even in other cities in Europe.</p>\n\n<p>If you hope so as well you are welcome to join us in a number of ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Support our Startnext campaign going online July 20<sup>th</sup>!

In the words of one of the professor at Politecnico \u201cit\u2019s like if a massive alien spacecraft has unexpectedly landed\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>This is considered a general upgrading of the district but no doubt resulted in a subsequent change in the social life.</p>\n\n<p>The newly established School of Design attracted some 4,000 students which increased the demand for daily, standard, low cost services. That is what today Bovisa offers for the most, since the majority of the students live somewhere else. When students are off the district it changes its face: bookshops, fast food, bars, copy centres are closed and leave the district lifeless.</p>\n\n<p>There are good practices for people aggregation like the local weekly street market, the cultural association Scighera, the social initiative Coltivando or the multiservice caf\xe8 Mamusca, but students show little interactions with it. It seems a missed opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>The aforementioned pushed the Politecnico University to challange itself asking \u201chow can our student transitional community and residents develop positive interactions and give new life to the district?\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>This is what the course \u2013 <em>PSSD 2017 Networks of Care Collaborative encounters in/around the Bovisa campus</em> \u2013 is about.</p>\n\n<p>Ezio Manzini and Liat Rogel, with Susanna De Besi wanted this to be the focus of their students\u2019 work for this year. And they suggested the students to interact with the edgeryders community as their works progress.</p>\n\n<p>Today introduction ended with the following questions to students:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Referring to your everyday interactions with Bovisa, when are you in need for care? \xa0And when are you willing to provide care to somebody else?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" href="/u/ezio_manzini">@Ezio_Manzini</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/social_open_campus">@Social_Open_Campus</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/rossana_torri">@Rossana_Torri</a> <span class="mention">@Liat</span> <a class="mention" href="/u/social_open_campus">@Social_Open_Campus</a>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 832, u'user_id': 3520, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-08 15:35:01', u'title': u'How can transitional communities take care of their host neighborhood?'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 834, u'user_id': 3625, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-09 20:50:19', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p><a href="https://fair.coop/" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>FairCoop</span></a><span> is, in fact, a lot of projects with a unifying mission behind all of them: to build alternative, grassroots-driven economy, which will be participatory, fair and belong to the people. All of the members of our global collective want to see that happen. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>The FairCoop Thessaloniki is a local group linked to the global movement. We\u2019re all dealing in different ways with the establishment of tools and processes that would bring about alternative, cooperative economies. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>In the case of our city, to some extent, it\u2019s done by implementation of alternative cryptocurrency, faircoin, developed by the FairCoop. We try to understand ways in which this currency, and a local currency introduced after the crisis, can coexist and supplement each other. In any case, the goal is to free ourselves from proprietary technologies and capitalist banking systems - by creating a parallel circular model, ideally connecting and supporting a whole ecosystem of projects locally and globally. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>There is also the ambition to create a health care system within the communities by implementing the same solutions and building autonomous, community managed and driven scheme, highly independent from the existing one. For example, it could be done by using the percentage of community\u2019s income to fund health care. It could even in the future take shape of an autonomous security system. Considering the increasingly ubiquitous 3D technology, many of the medical tools can be soon printed cheaply by anyone. Small ethical pharmaceuticals will be able to produce their own medicine. And all the wealth that is sucked up from the communities will stay there, making them stronger and independent. It is already the case in Spain, where after 6 years of experiments in the communities of all kinds a lot of generated income has been fed back and used to build, support projects, create systems of all kinds. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>We also plan to replace the public system with a cooperative one. For now, it\u2019s a hurdle - but in the future, it will be possible. The condition? The strong community behind it. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>FairCoop exists since 2 years, and in Thessaloniki, it started a few months ago. We have links with dozens of cooperatives, organizations, initiatives and communities - such as Bitcoin community, P2P foundation, Catalonia Cooperative, etc. We\u2019ve brought on board more than 1000 people so far. Yet, there\u2019s still a lot to be done. We need to connect and build stronger alliances even in the cities - in Thessaloniki, many existing initiatives remain disconnected from each other. We need to develop models of integral cooperation on different levels. Bring decentralized technologies to local communities to make them more resilient. And seed the idea of cooperation, which will replace competition. </span></p>', u'post_id': 741, u'user_id': 3404, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-12 16:26:33', u'title': u'FairCoop - Spreading the seed of cooperation to replace competition'}, {u'content': u'<p>I made a quick network sketch of the OpenInsulin conversation and how it fits in OpenCare as a whole.

These contributions can take the form of directly supporting people and communities through giving them access to education, healthy food, social support, nature, informations about political and administrative procedures. Indirectly they also allow the development of a culture of mutual help, sharing and empowerment. This post is a description of what we have learned about care structures in communities during our years as community activists building Prinzessinengarten an urban garden in Berlin.</p>\n\n<p>But let\u2019s start from the beginning\u2026.</p>\n\n<h2>Prinzessinnengarten: Making gardens from wasteland</h2>\n\n<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/16450772" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" title="Prinzessinnengarten, Berl\xedn \xa9 2010 Monocle" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe>\n\n<p>At Moritzplatz, a busy roundabout in the center of bustling Berlin-Kreuzberg, well over a thousand supporters have helped the site to grow, turning a lot that was vacant for 60 years into a flourishing garden. Without specific expertise, with little money and motivated by the idea of a communally used garden in the center of the city, we began in summer 2009 to put down the first roots of a flourishing garden between cement and rubble. By now, a huge diversity of plants is growing here as well as a diversity of social relations. People of different origins and of different ages meet and exchange their knowledge and their experience.</p>\n\n<p>The Prinzessinnengarten is a communal project; our vegetable beds are shared without anyone claiming individual ownership. Over the course of four years, supporters from the local community have dirtied their hands in order to. This takes place in a neighborhood that is one of the most densely developed and socially most vulnerable in the city. Here a garden evolved that can sustain itself financially and that grew into a locus of social exchange and mutual learning.</p>\n\n<p>Prinzessinnengarten, as well as other urban gardens in Germany, have been able to develop small economies around its activities. Prinzessinnengarten has been able to support 15 full-time jobs during it seasons, being financially independent through its economic activities such as horticulture, the tending of a small caf\xe9, selling its products, as well as giving training in gardening, ecology or the planning of further gardens. At the same time, it has been able to offer high quality, healthy and ecological food at affordable prices.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In cooperation with local institutions, with universities and international partners, the Prinzessinnengarten became a laboratory for resilient forms of urban development. In a pragmatic manner, we have been asking questions on how to deal with urgent issues such as climate change, dwindling resources, food sovereignty and the loss of biodiversity. The answers being experienced and experimented on all strive toward the creation of a resilient city, not only taking global challenges such as climate change into consideration\xa0but also incorporating local actors in the building of practical and local solutions. \xa0\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The success of the garden has been vividly mirrored in vast press coverage: Since 2009, well over a thousand supporters have helped the site to grow \u201efrom an ugly vacant lot to a paradise\u201c (Die Zeit). 60,000 visitors come to Moritzplatz each year to see this \u201ebiotope and sociotope with a model character\u201c (Tagesspiegel), this \u201eutopia in miniature\u201c (Berliner Zeitung)\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Despite the garden being a celebrated pioneer project and undisputed value even by official sources, in 2012 the Berlin Property Fund was commissioned to sell the plot of land on which the garden stands. We only had an annually renewable lease, leaving no prospects for long-term planning. Through the immense support of our public and an increasingly motivated government, the Berlin government decided to return the property the Borough of Kreuzberg-Friedrichshain. The Prinzessinnengarten has been able to establish its model character as a locus of social, ecological and urban change.</p>\n\n<p>To discuss questions arising from this kind of community engagement, Elizabeth Calderon-L\xfcning, Marco Clausen, and Asa Sonjasdotter initiated the Neighbourhood Academy in 2015:a self-organized open platform for urban and rural knowledge sharing, cultural practice and activism. This bottom-up academy combines different knowledge- and experienced-based formats: non-standardized knowledge, hands-on know-how, sensuous narratives and research methods. People, organizations, and projects from different neighborhoods come together. Participants can come from Berlin-Kreuzberg or the region around Berlin just as likely as from Detroit or rural areas in Greece to find common ground for learning and teaching.\xa0</p>\n\n<h2>So what have we learned about care structures in communities?</h2>\n\n<p>In taking over responsibilities in issues that affect the whole society - refugees, climate change, social and ecological justice, to name just a few - community-based and grassroots initiatives play an increasing role in tackling these challenges and their effects on the local level. They are breeding grounds for social innovations and new bottom-up-strategies. Often people take initiative when traditional or institutional forms of care and support decline or do not meet people\u2019s needs. Community gardens and urban agriculture- the field in which I am personally engaged- can serve as a good example. Without being part of planning, or political programs, these places are mostly created by local, self-organized initiatives. Based on local engagement and alternative forms of economy and often without public or financial support, community gardens contribute to the well-being, social inclusion, healthy and sustainable lifestyles, biodiversity, the physical- as well as the social climate. Not only they contribute to the physical health of their participants, but also to their sense of dignity and self-esteem.</p>\n\n<p>There is also a downside to community engagement. While community organizations have to promote themselves with success stories to get recognition, political- and financial support, the negative aspects are often less visible. You hear a lot about precarious funding, internal or outside conflicts, political and economic pressure, multitasking, impossible workloads, competition between projects. At the same time, dealing with complex and often rigid political and social institutions, community activists have to become self-trained experts in finances, public relations, lobbying, community-organizing etc. But these fights are long and complex and the institutions and their procedures require a patience that easily outlive the time, the physical and mental resources individuals and grassroots initiatives are able to mobilize.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, this situation can result in what you might call an \u201eactivism-burnout\u201c. When this happens, physical, mental, and social damages are far too often just seen as a personal or biographical drama. These individual burn-outs are likely to be accompanied by a weakening or even a collapse of the organizations and initiatives that are often carried by the engagement of single individuals. The disintegration can lead to a situation where an organization loses knowledge, expertise, networks, and spirit.</p>\n\n<p>For the reasons mentioned above, community care should also include structures to support the people that are directly invested in it. It should create securing and supporting networks. Instead of competing, it should allow people from different initiatives in different fields of engagement to share their knowledge of failure. There should be at once structures of collective learning and consultancy, which at the same time help the individuals to find spaces of trust and recreation. With the Neighborhood Academy, we started informal meetings with members of different groups and initiatives, not only to exchange experience and knowledge and to broaden networks and alliances, but also to deal with stress, conflict, fear, doubt, and failure on a more personal level. Even though this is just a tentative beginning, we experience a need for this kind of care and support structures, which was previously not expressed. Often issues related to the stressful conditions of organizations and community initiatives are externalized into the private and infuse personal relations . Therefore on a structural level, we see these caring structures also as a\xa0form to win even when you lose.</p>\n\n<p>Community groups often focus on single questions, spaces, conflicts. They often react under economic and time pressure to immediate problems. They act within marginalized or weak political and economical communities. They deal with institutions and stakeholders with more time, much power, and resources whereas they rely on limited personal resources or precarious funding. Simultaneously there are a lot of joy, learning and personal empowerment involved as well as a sense of a meaningful life and community relations. However, the risk of failing is high, which can lead to frustration and disintegration.</p>\n\n<p>Community care structures can help to ease this stress not only in giving support but also in a form of what we call \u201ecollective learning\u201c. They can work as an archive for the knowledge, the experiences and know-how being created in grassroots and community initiatives. Thus, they allow activists to see themselves not only as part of a\xa0singular local fight that you might win or lose\xa0but as contributors to a collective living memory.</p>', u'post_id': 507, u'user_id': 3326, u'timestamp': u'2016-06-13 21:01:09', u'title': u'Community Care and Care Structures for Community Activists'}, {u'content': u'<p>Notes from the gathering on 26.04.2017.

Belgium is 14<sup>th</sup>\xa0(out of 30) in the European index. The medicine doesn\u2019t cost much here. Pumps, sensors etc. come with the package patients get from convention centers. The Diabetes Liga\xa0sells some stuff like glucometers, sensors, strips. It doesn\'t make sense to sell other stuff, since they get it cheaply from convention centers. The convention centers are an intermediary between hospitals and the government health services.</p>\n\n<p>Maria (<a class="mention" href="/u/mboto">@mboto</a> ): it\'s the same in Spain, it\'s almost free.</p>\n\n<p>Guido: The problem is clearly different in the US vs. here. In the US the price is a problem. Here the problem is more type 2 diabetes, specifically the\xa0prevention, as it\'s a lifestyle diseases. Many organizations work on that. Diabetes still costs the government way too much money because of it: checkups, dietary stuff, ... Type 2 diabetes here is also tied to poverty. The best way to reach these poorer people is the doctor, but they usually have no time.</p>\n\n<p>Maria: it would be best to focus on this type, because it\u2019s an actual problem here. It\u2019s hard to reach these poor groups, we could help there. An art project would be a good medium in general to spread awareness to the public.</p>\n\n<p>Through the non-profit Ekoli, we do come into contact with poorer and vulnerable groups of children in Belgium. This ties in with the idea of <a class="mention" href="/u/niekd">@NiekD</a> \xa0for <a href="/t/open-insulin-educational-outreach/6201">educational outreach</a>. It would be a way to assist with the pressing matters here.</p>\n\n<p>Vincent: <em>someone</em> is paying for the insulin here. Probably tax payers. Guido: yes, there are intermediaries that gain a lot from the government. In the US that is much more. There was a scandal not too long ago: big companies were making deals. Walmart is now also bringing back an old version of insulin to sell it cheaper. People here are spoiled though:\xa0they are always asking for faster, better insulin. They wouldn\u2019t settle anymore for older types.</p>\n\n<p>Other info around the Diabetes Liga. They have about 80.000 patient members and 2.000 professionals. The members determine what the organisation does, and cheaper insulin simply isn\'t a policy point here. Guido mentioned the Open Insulin project at the office, but it was not a priority at all.</p>\n\n<p>Pieter will design some infographics that can be used for communicating about the issues surrounding diabetes/insulin. The International Diabetes Foundation has some good ones already, these can be used as well or serve as\xa0a starting point.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thanks a lot\xa0Guido for the interesting input! I\'m\xa0interested to hear what others think. How can we shape the project so that it also meets the needs of the Belgium situation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The next gathering is in two weeks: Wednesday 10 May at 8pm @ ReaGent</p>\n\n<p><a href="/t/openvillage/788"></a></p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284.png" class="lightbox" title="banner_0.png"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284_1_690x85.png" width="690" height="85"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">banner_0.png</span><span class="informations">728x90 28.5 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p></p>', u'post_id': 6278, u'user_id': 3362, u'timestamp': u'2017-04-28 07:43:21', u'title': u'Insulin/diabetes situation in Belgium (Team meeting notes 26.04.2017)'}, {u'content': u'<p>Description:</p>\n\n<p>Stress is inevitable.

Alkasem, a doctorstudent and Syrian Refugee started a really important conversation about collaboration: how can we collaborate if there is no trust? Lets go back to this conversation and look at what came out of it</p>\n\n<p>Citation from the workshop:\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>SIDENOTE 2: Alkasem was again the most disruptive thinker in the group and gave us a lot to think. For him, everything moves around friendship. He has the feeling that a lot of people in western society start of with mistrust. If you start with mistrust it is difficult to create trust.\xa0And without trust no skill can be shared. This intervention of him started a discussion about the meaning of trust and how we can build that.</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2018Trust is an enabler to use the resources.\xa0How can that be created inside an eclectic group like this?\u2019,asked Yannick.\xa0 For Claire it is a text and rules of engagement and a clear path of conflict resolution, and a way to learn to treat each other better.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Winnie reacted that your own people\'s trust is a constant, but gaining the network\'s trust is more difficult.</p>\n\n<p>With the help of Nadia we\xa0made a synthesis of the discussion</p>\n\n<p>1) Working trust is very different from social trust; and there needs to be a boundary.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>2) What also worked for her is deciding to work on even a small project.</p>\n\n<p>3) A story that binds us together - understanding how our different activities are related</p>\n\n<p>4) Documentation: what does it mean? for us it has been in writing.</p>\n\n<p>Finding each other strengths and weaknesses by organizing small events with each other, and beginning with things that don\'t have something big at stake. Because then we can learn about each other. The importance of documentation in building trust: Leaving a story behind that people can follow.</p>\n\n<p>When the discussion was coming to an end we all felt we had got a lot of information and the workshop was going to close. So Nadia came up with a good idea to end the workshop with something concrete. We all felt that one of the biggest issues in care is that we live to much on our own island and that if we want to make care better we need to share and collaborate. But to collaborate we need to create trust. So this exercise was given to every participant and will hopefully end up in solidifying the care network in Belgium. The following question was asked:</p>\n\n<p>What can i bring to another organization, that also better myself as a person and is easily realizable?</p>\n\n<p>This question will be asked again at the next meeting we are organizing.

I just couldn't understand what she was referring to. Did she really enjoy this? Immediately I \u2013 as teens do \u2013 started to question myself: Why wasn't I that self-organized structure-loving girl that always got everything right, made reasonable decisions and planned her life 5 months beforehand?</p>\n\n<p>As the years went by, I began to understand that it was not the fact that Tina loved ticking off to-do-lists that\xa0 seemed so strange to me. It was the logic of efficiency, that I began to see everywhere. Peers trying to \u201eget it all right\u201c, to \u201eavoid failing\u201c. To master their own life as it was some kind of stress test. And to always be ready for the next job interview, a smooth and pleasing CV at hand.</p>\n\n<p>I was and I am a part of that. And it strikes me that this kind of neoliberal thinking of \u201eyour life (and your success/failure) is your responsibility\u201c leads us sometimes to very harsh assumptions about ourselves and our peers.</p>\n\n<p>I can now see all of that in a broader socio-economic context of destabilized markets and societies. We are all, in a way, facing much more uncertain futures than our parents did (while it is extremely difficult to get a full understanding of how this is just a perceived thing or really the case).</p>\n\n<p>Against this backdrop, the topic of mental and emotional resilience seems really a thing we should put our minds to. What does \u201ereal\u201c self-care mean when we are all trained to function? When spiritual practices like yoga and meditation are already a part of improving ourselves, being a good self-entrepreneur who, after a good yoga-session, can function even better, work even longer hours?\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I think sharing our vulerabilities and insecurities around failing, missing out and not wanting anymore is crucial at this point. Although there are already some great projects bringing these issues into awareness it seems that for a majority of people the stigma around for example mental illness, burnout etc. is still too big to cope with on their own.</p>\n\n<p>How can we turn sadness, unproductivity and inefficiency into an accepted part of life and how can we help people to cope with expectations they can't and don't want to meet?</p>", u'post_id': 666, u'user_id': 3255, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-15 15:22:56', u'title': u'On being a self-entrepreneur'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 657, u'user_id': 3246, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-09 16:57:48', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 751, u'user_id': 3418, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-18 18:27:57', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p>Asnada is an association born in 2010 inspired from the strong desire of investigating the role of the language in integration processes. Through our social and educational work, we try to answer a question: how can we live together taking care of our specific differences?\xa0 Far from the identity concept, we make the most of our similarity, using the new language (Italian) as a common ground. We have opened a first school for refugees and asylum seekers and, some years later, a school for unaccompanied minors. We are now nine (eight women and a man) coming from different backgrounds (Journalism, Pedagogy, Classical Studies, Education, Psychology, Cultural mediation, Languages) and ages (from 25 to 55).\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Our schools are the places where we try to build up familiar relationships and a sense of community, but also the place where we try to understand, together, the contradictions of the world we live in. The learning group has here an essential role because it\u2019s the context in which every single student find his place, support and the courage to express himself. The variety of writing and speaking levels we look for in the student group is meant to lead to a free and informal circulation of knowledge and language skills, creating a context where the directory of teaching is also transversal, not only vertical.</p>\n\n<p>The language we teach is not only the language of the daily routine, but an intimate language which allows people to reshape and rename their past and present experience, together with their aspirations and future projects. In order to allow everybody to have the opportunity to express himself or herself, we don\u2019t only use the spoken and written language: theatre exercises, songs, handcraft workshops, games, silent books, pictures and images, silk-screen printing, short films are the means through which explore the new language and ourselves.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Montessori\u2019s instruments give an important support to the learning process, as they help reading and writing but also studying grammatical and syntactical structures. We both use original instruments (for example, sandpaper letters, movable alphabet, set analysis and grammar symbols) and readapted tools we calibrated on purpose for the whole group.</p>\n\n<p>During these years we\u2019ve been meeting more than six hundred people coming from all over the world. This exchange of unconscious knowledge constantly creating new ways of schooling and in these years made us organize specific projects based on students real needs or passions:\xa0</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The discover of the importance - especially for illiterate students - of learning at a slow rhythm, also thanks to practical activities, is the reason why, three years ago, we started to organize \u201cThe ground language\u201d (La lingua della terra), a class around the growing of a vegetable garden and the study of the organic agriculture principles.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The comprehension of the role of the mother tongue in our life, as the skeleton of our soul, press us to find a way to support and promote all the mother tongues. So, we hold up a group of story-tellers named \u201cRoots and Branches\u201d (Radici e Rami) sharing traditional and fairy tales, poems and myths in the first languages and in Italian.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Due to the need to use as soon as possible the new language also in order to better understand the world where we are living, with its contradictions, injustices and opportunities, we started to explore the city not only as tourists but as researchers: recorder, camera and a set of questions are the equipment with which we walk through the city asking people we meet to share their ideas, their point of view and experience about an issue which is meaningful for all the group.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The importance to look at the students as men and women having resources, abilities and strength enhance equal relationships.\xa0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>From 2016, Asnada collaborates with the groups Nuovo Armenia and Gina Films. The City of Milano has assigned to us a farmstead (Cascina) situated in the centre of Dergano, a neighbors in the north of the city, in order to build up a place where migration issues could be faced through a cultural production, developed with the foreign communities themselves.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Our goal is to reshape the collective perception of the migration issue with the direct experience of a possibile living together, in order to avoid the usual relationships based on charity or humanitarian help. The \u201cCascina\u201d will be the place where, besides our schools, will be held a multilingual cinema where foreign and Italian people will watch movies in original languages, but also a cafeteria (with controlled prices) and a coworking area. The collaboration of schools and cinema\xa0wants\xa0to start a process of thought consciousness by crossing these two situations: italians dealing with foreign languages, and foreign people dealing with Italian and other foreign languages.</p>\n\n<p>The \u201cCascina\u201d will be also a place for permanent education in intercultural field, where we will set meeting, readings, conferences and workshops open to all citizen, with a particular regard to the foreign communities of the neighbors.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 828, u'user_id': 3550, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-03 17:14:19', u'title': u'Language, culture and cinema for an alternative imagery of immigration and integration'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 810, u'user_id': 3533, u'timestamp': u'2017-01-18 21:18:53', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p>Public places have to be accessible to all regardless their mobility capacity. The City Administration regulated the matter for new buildings as well as existing ones. The latter faced a variety of unforeseen problems that resulted into a 10% compliance rate in 15 months since the law passed. In the common understanding, this means a public effort not hitting the target, a cracked relationship between the City Administration and private businesses and ultimately disadvantaged people still vulnerable.</p>\n\n<p>The story begins in 2015 with the City of Milan to pass the Building Regulation article 77 that required all bars, shops, restaurants and craft activities bordering the road, to provide easy access to people with limited mobility or disabilities (the National Institute of Statistic in 2007 assessed <a href="http://www.cittametropolitana.mi.it/export/sites/default/affari_sociali/Allegati/ops_approfondimento_disabili.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">13.189</a> people with mobility disabilities in Milan).

An article on <a href="http://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2017/01/05/news/milano_negozi_barriere_architettoniche-155417926/?ref=search" rel="nofollow noopener">la Repubblica</a>, the second most read Italian newspaper, by the 5 January 2017, published these data and opened a public discussion on the subject.</p>\n\n<p>Lisa Noja (delegate of the Major for accessibility policies) said: <i>We have to make sure that very quickly all businesses comply. This year we want to get to the full application of a rule of civilization and to do that you cannot only use repressive strategies.</i></p>\n\n<p>It was a beginning of a twist in the Municipal strategy and the start of a speculation about the most effective way to enforce a regulation. The new thinking included working with trade associations, like Confcommercio, as well as promoting campaigns to engage business holders.</p>\n\n<p>Cristina Tajani (City Councillor for labour policies, businesses, trade and human resources) said: <i>places that show attention to the disabled are also easily accessible to children, parents with strollers and the elderly. This does not mean that they will not be submitted to controls, but we want help the business understand that the adjustment should not only be seen as an obligation. It is also a business opportunity.</i></p>\n\n<p>This is when OpenCare approach came handy. Local staff including WeMake was involved and started talking to as many people as possible, to understand what was not working and tentatively get it streight.</p>\n\n<p><b>Listening\xa0</b>it was vital to start from the pieces of the City Administration that were involved from the beginning like the Major Cabinet, the Urbanistic Department, the Public Soil Occupation Office and lately Urban Economy and Work department. We have understood that the building legislation was conceived in a department and the implementing regulation was written in a different one (and of course published through another one). That gave a lot of room to officers for interpretations and tightening the instructions for businesses to prevent opportunistic behaviors. \xa0\xa0</p>\n\n<p><b>Including</b> as the collaboration with the trade association got closed we\u2019ve understood more of the problems that businesses are facing to comply with the regulation, such as: high costs, complex red tape, lack of understanding of the most suitable solution and existing solutions too standardized. Since red tape is partially due to complex <a href="http://www.comune.milano.it/wps/portal/ist/it/servizi/tributi/occupazione_suolo_pubblico/abbattimento_barriere_ingressi_accessibili" rel="nofollow noopener">implementing regulations</a> and the unclear communication follows, we started facilitating a mutual dialogue between pieces of public administration, businesses and associations. Regarding costs and production related problems, we can take it into the arena of manufacturing 4.0 by including also designers, makers, social innovators, businesses and utilizers.</p>\n\n<p><b>Going where innovation beats</b>\xa0we have started organizing an experimentation called Open Rampe (Rampe means Ramps/Slides) in a limited area of the city that has everything it takes. The <em>Quartiere Isola</em> in fact has a functioning District for Urban Commerce, a civic center devoted to urban regeneration, art and crafts workshops (<a href="http://www.lastecca.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">ADA stecca</a>), active businesses and a long tradition of civic participation. Our idea is to engage business individually and through a public event by 11th April. Involving them into\xa0co-design sessions pivoting around their necessities may generate unexpected outcomes.</p>\n\n<p><b>Dealing with collective intelligence\xa0</b>is what we have just started doing by sharing this story here. Any input from the community could be brought into our experimentation and add value to it. It would be interesting to study this collaboration as it happens and share it.</p>\n\n<p>This is where we stand now and the next steps are:</p>\n\n<p><b>Co-designing / mobilizing resources\xa0</b>of course we will not predefine outputs, but rather keep the sessions open to any outcomes.</p>\n\n<p><b>Prototyping policies\xa0</b>by monitoring and evaluating this experimentation.</p>\n\n<p>We are aware that talking about \u201cenforcing\u201d a policy collaboratively may sounds an oxymoron. Since article 77 of the building regulation fits in the EU and the National legal frameworks, it is certainly a top down process.\xa0Nevertheless, the Open care approach might help policy makers, (non)compliant businesses, users and citizens to achieve simpler, cheaper and faster solutions.</p>\n\n<p>It would be interesting to know who else has been involved in a similar process and managed it collaboratively.

I\u2019m a keen cyclist for transport and leisure, but my profession is also research in devices enhancing the mobility for people with physical limitations. Therefore I feel an obligation to spread the news about recent advancements in cycling for physically challenged. Have you heard about FES cycling?</p>\n\n<p>FES -<a href="/t/fes-for-foot-drop/667"> short for functional electrical stimulation</a> - can be used to activate paralyzed muscles by impulses imitating the nervous system in the most natural way possible. We have come a long way with our research and it is possible to use this technique to let people with paralyzed legs cycle again. For some reason there are very few people who know about this so I\u2019d like to share this knowledge with you.</p>\n\n<p>We cycle to move, but also to maintain fit. It can be both fun and functional. But, if your legs don\'t obey you anymore, you will probably not consider it a possibility. Paralyzed legs can result from an accident breaking your back, a stroke or a sneaking disease like the multiple sclerosis. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>People caring for and curing you need to be very pragmatic, and you with them. Mobility then becomes reduced to passive transport, a dietetic approach to avoiding getting fat and medication of pressure sores and other side effects from lack of physical exercise. That\u2019s where the <a href="/t/doctor-could-you-hack-me-a-neuroprosthesis-please/483">publicly unknown FES research comes into play</a>. Years of clinical research have consolidated the benefits, but we need to spread the news and understand more about it. Some people may already have heard of handbikes. They allow you to cover greater distances than manual wheelchairs. They are special tricycles where you use the hands for pedaling.</p>\n\n<p>FES, on the other side, is applied via adhesive electrodes or incorporated in bicycle shorts. The stimulus activates the muscles of the buttocks and thighs in sync with the ride. \xa0However only the leg muscles can challenge the cardiovascular system to get physically fit. Some people with for example spinal cord injury (paraplegia) may be able to use FES for activating these large muscles. \xa0With FES cycling they can cover greater distances with greater speed and due to activation of large muscles they get (bene-)fit and feel physical well-being. The research community has tried to promote a more widespread use of FES cycling by arranging <a href="http://www.cybathlon.ethz.ch/en/the-disciplines/fes-race/fes-teams.html" rel="nofollow noopener">races</a> (see <a href="https://youtu.be/Rx9I_hYqQcM?t=64" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>) and publications with the user\'s statements of the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aor.2002.26.issue-3/issuetoc" rel="nofollow noopener">pros and cons</a>\xa0(see <a href="http://www.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/research/impdev/fits/fes-cycling.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/aa450aa4854da962804fe9788f12fe8b5b20e452" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aa450aa4854da962804fe9788f12fe8b5b20e452.jpg" class="lightbox" title="bb.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/aa450aa4854da962804fe9788f12fe8b5b20e452_1_690x319.jpg" width="690" height="319"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">bb.jpg</span><span class="informations">1122x520 409 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>How can we build research into practice or at least make options much more accessible?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The question is how to help people who have become paraplegic or their families know about the existence of such possibilities. FES bikes are quite expensive so <a href="http://www.berkelbike.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">where to go to try them</a>? Many places and cycle lanes are missing so it requires some changes to infrastructure as well. But as long as nobody uses them it\'s a vicious circle. Therefore we need more awareness to reduce cost, change infrastructure and increase inclusion in the cycle community</p>\n\n<p>Even handbikes which are more popular can\u2019t be bought in a normal bicycle shop, but rather directly from a few specialized companies. The lack of marketing incurs high costs to manufacturers and hence to clients.</p>\n\n<p>My own group\u2019s response as research and practitioners is to <a href="http://wehandu.it/" rel="nofollow noopener">create a culture to promote this change</a>, a project in the making. How can we promote actual experience based dialogue between users (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1525-1594.2002.06936.x/epdf" rel="nofollow noopener">who are maybe hackers</a>) and researchers?

Operating as a nonprofit technology company, we develop free and open-source tools that can be adapted for specific uses, backed by evidence. Health workers currently use Medic Mobile to register every pregnancy, immunize infants against illnesses, track disease outbreaks faster, keep stock of essential medicines, and communicate about emergencies. Our platform is built for the last mile of healthcare, supporting over 12,000 community health workers in 23 countries.</p>\n\n<p>We currently have 52 staff and three hubs: San Francisco, USA; Kathmandu, Nepal; Nairobi, Kenya. Not all of our staff works out of these hubs - about \u2153 of the team is remote. We spend a lot of time on Slack!</p>\n\n<p>Our approach has its roots in service and human-centered design. A lot of people are using these ideas now. Seven years ago, when we started, they were not so well known. We have a whole team of designers, including regional designers who use a participatory, ethnographic, HCD approach. They do in-depth site visits and investigate the context in which the apps will be used, and use a variety of techniques to do so: system mapping, role playing, in-depth interviewing. Some questions they might ask: \u201cWhat is the current workflow? Ideal workflow?\u201d, \u201cWhat is the day-to-day like for end users?\u201d It\u2019s an intensive and essential process.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019re inspired by a whole host of organizations in this space, including IDEO, Acumen, etc. 100% of our staff do a HCD crash course. Specifically for our designers, we have our own design curriculum, and many of them come from an HCD or anthropology background.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the services that Medic Mobile provides?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Medic believes that health is a human right. We know that global health disparities around the world are vast, and it\u2019s estimated that one billion people will never see a doctor in their lifetime. In many places around the world - especially low and middle income countries - community health workers (CHWs) are closing that gap. CHWs are community members - sometimes volunteers, but ideally paid - who provide basic AND complex health care for their neighbors. Our vision is to equip these CHWs with mobile technology and the right tools to increase their impact.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a community health worker can support in the following ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tIdentifying and supporting pregnant women;</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tHelping ensure the pregnant woman gets four antenatal care checkups, and identify any danger signs. (Having frequent checkups increases the chance the mother will give birth in a facility and survive child birth.)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tEnsure that children are vaccinated fully;</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tScreen children and adults for common diseases (diarrhea, malaria), malnutrition, mental health, etc.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>In many of these scenarios, community health workers serve as first responders, so that patients can start getting treatment quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Medic Mobile\u2019s tools are oriented around <a href="https://www.medicmobile.org/usecases" rel="nofollow noopener">specific evidence-based use cases that have a clear impact logic</a>. For example, we know that if we support a pregnant woman receiving a full course of antenatal care, she is more likely to deliver in a facility and survive child birth. Our use cases currently are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tAntenatal care</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tChildhood immunizations</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tUnder 5 child health</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tStock monitoring</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tDisease surveillance</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>What the means is that in above areas, we have a ton of evidence and experience that our tools work. For a new use case - say, an area of health services or protocol that we\u2019re not as familiar with - we have to do a lot of design. The design and product development teams are very tightly integrated.</p>\n\n<p>As far as tools, we have tools for basic phones and smartphones (Android exclusively). We work with implementing partners and/or governments to equip health workers with these tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I was interested that you mentioned delivering advanced/complex care this way?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Broadly, when you\u2019re dealing with delivering care for complex health conditions in resource-poor settings, there\u2019s two issues:</p>\n\n<p>1) Practically, you need what Paul Farmer calls \u201cstaff, stuff, space, systems.\u201d You need expert knowledge. For example, to treat cancer, you need a professionalized cadre, you need certain goods like chemotherapy drugs, etc. All of that won\u2019t be delivered solely through community health workers.</p>\n\n<p>2) Where community health workers can come in for complex health conditions is in coordinating access, screening, and adherence to treatment. For example, with HIV. Thirty years ago, the World Health Organization suggested that delivering HIV care to the ultra poor was \u201ctoo difficult, that there wasn\u2019t enough money, it was too difficult to get people to adhere to medications out in the community.\u201d Partners In Health (whose work is very influential for us) showed that community health workers can support people in adhering to HIV medication.</p>\n\n<p>Same for TB. They proved that if you make the drugs available, you can even support the treatment of Multi-Drug Resistant TB through CHWs\u2013 where you have to take drugs daily for almost two years (and they have terrible side effects). Again, this is through trained community health workers in a process they call \u201caccompaniment,\u201d where CHWs are following up every day, providing support and guidance and ensuring that people are taking meds. In India, there\u2019s been a lot of success with the Home Based Newborn Care protocol which provides guidance to community health workers around the first 45 days of life and navigating the major risks to a child\u2019s life during that period.</p>\n\n<p>Community health workers are starting to be used in the US, too \u2013 in Harlem, First Nation communities, and the rural South. So CHWs can definitely support health issues that are complex and difficult, and in fact, can probably do so more effectively and with more touch points than a physician could.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do health workers have to be literate to use Medic tools?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ideally, yes, but we\u2019ve worked with many CHWs\xa0that have mixed or low literacy. For example, the Female Community Health Volunteer (FCHV) network in Nepal has mixed literacy. We\u2019ve equipped them with basic phones where the FCHV can text something very basic like \u201cP 12 Jill\u201d to mean \u201cJill is pregnant, her last menstrual period (LMP) was 12 weeks ago.\u201d Then, Medic Mobile will send the health worker SMS messages, reminding her to remind Jill about her antenatal care checkups. Someone with a low level of literacy can still use these messages, and we provide booklets/guides to make sure they can remember how. We also have a thorough training process, where we start with teaching these health workers (if needed) how to turn on their phones, how to enter characters, everything from soup to nuts. In Nepal specifically, many FCHVs have reported feeling more empowered and motivated after being trained to use these mobile tools for their work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are your tools evolving?</strong></p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s a very timely question. We are combining what we\u2019ve learned over the last 6-7 years and developing apps that support <a href="https://www.medicmobile.org/blog/a-new-version-of-medic-mobiles-software-supporting-big-shifts-in-global-health-care-delivery" rel="nofollow noopener">key shifts that we\u2019re seeing in global health care delivery</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We are moving beyond data collection to decision support. Previously, our tool was often a substitute for form filling (ie. registering a pregnancy), but more and more, we are helping community health workers make decisions \u2013 around complex protocols for under 5 child health, for example. We\u2019re moving towards supporting integrated performance management of CHWs, managing CHW targets and providing support for supervisory meetings between community health workers and their managers. Also, integrated health systems require integrated technology tools that will support families over time and across a variety of health issues. If we simply organize health information by specific conditions or by form, we could miss opportunities to provide longitudinal support, leave out important social and historical context, and create unintuitive workflows.</p>\n\n<p>In general, we know that reactive systems that rely on sick patients showing up at facilities don\'t achieve equitable health outcomes. Health systems should be proactive and timely by design: mobile tools have an important role to play in bringing health workers to families\' doorsteps often and early.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you coordinate with local government and politicians?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are usually working with long term community-based partners. Ideally, organizations who already work\xa0with the local government. At some point, we want the local government to take over our mobile tools; the goal is always for the ministry to take over. We also sit on advisory committees and advise national eHealth and mHealth strategy in many of the countries where we work. We are committed to sustainable use of our tools. For that, we have to work hand in hand with local and national governments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is it open source? Can I deploy my own?</strong></p>\n\n<p>All our software is open source. You can certainly deploy our tools yourself, <a href="https://www.medicmobile.org/diy" rel="nofollow noopener">especially our DIY toolkit</a>.

Collected data can be applied to a various range of fields.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>reHub is an interface of interaction man-machine. It can be used in various areas for example the evaluation of dexterity, sport, music &amp; gaming.</p>\n\n<p>Our beneficiaries are all those people who needs to have an experience feedback concerning the hand movements.</p>\n\n<p>reHub glove is a tool designed for proprioceptive rehabilitation, to recover movement fluidity after an injury: provided by the physiotherapist, it allows the patient to record and report exercises data such as hand position, finger flexion and fingertips pressure. Recorded data are displayed through a software that reproduces a 3D hand, its movements and detected values. Through the software a physiotherapist is able to evaluate the therapeutic process and possibly change it. Thanks to reHub exercises can be done in physiotherapist presence or at a distance.</p>\n\n<p>ReHub acquires informations about fingers movements from flex and pressure sensors. It uses a 6DOF sensor to define the position of the hand in space.</p>\n\n<p>reHub glove is the result of a meeting between electronics enthusiasts, a physical therapist and a hand rehabilitation patient to find a way to solve the problem of monitoring the progress during rehabilitation therapy. During this meeting we found out there are no digital devices to monitor the hand rehabilitation and we decided to develop one.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>To define our project we didn\u2019t started from a theoretical concept. We started to make the prototype and to test it.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The development of reHub working prototype has been at the heart of our design process.</p>\n\n<p>As described on <a></a><a href="http://www.rehub.pro" rel="nofollow noopener">www.rehub.pro</a>, the definition of the prototype is subdivided into 4 time frames of research and development. The first steps of the team have moved in electronics and design.</p>\n\n<p>After testing the very first glove we decided to create an integrated system with a self-produced/maker pcb. Our design has always been oriented, and always will be, to integrate all electronics on the top of the glove. Another aspect of our prototype is that the glove itself must be comfortable for the patient. At a later time, once we knew that the glove was able to transmit data to the computer, we focused on the development of a software allowing patients and physiotherapists to evaluate the glove\u2019s collected data through a graphical interface and cartesian charts.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking for our final user(s), who will try our product and help us develop different options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Sport</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Gaming</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Educational</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Medical \xa0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>We want to built a community and start a business strategy.</p>\n\n<p>We will publish tutorials, kits and software to make your glove.</p>\n\n<p>Everything to improve the glove solution.</p>\n\n<p>We want to develop 4 different kits to sell:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>with single sensors\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>only the electronics</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>glove tailored</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>complete of all\n\n<p>components</p>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Websites &amp; Social</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.rehub.pro" rel="nofollow noopener">www.rehub.pro</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/rehubglove" rel="nofollow noopener">www.facebook.com/rehubglove</a></p>', u'post_id': 33751, u'user_id': 3516, u'timestamp': u'2017-05-03 09:12:09', u'title': u'reHub - rehabilitation glove'}, {u'content': u'<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/f6848044d110e2a900b01bf8d651ff08d9a1f2bb" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f6848044d110e2a900b01bf8d651ff08d9a1f2bb.jpg" class="lightbox" title="rsz_img_4039_kleiner.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f6848044d110e2a900b01bf8d651ff08d9a1f2bb_1_690x462.jpg" width="690" height="462"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">rsz_img_4039_kleiner.jpg</span><span class="informations">2500x1674 450 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>I am actively involved in alternative ways of doing research as one of the initiators behind <a href="/t/reagent-bringing-quality-biology-education-to-every-child-equally/682">ReaGent</a>, a publicly accessible biolab that allows citizens to do research independent of institutions. I facilitate and participate in open research projects and teach children and adults alike about biosciences.</p>\n\n<p>Research is an important driver for progress in healthcare. It brings us cheaper medicine, cures to seemingly incurable diseases and better therapies.</p>\n\n<p>Yet research methods have not evolved much at all to better reflect the needs of patients and citizens. The people whom the research is essentially meant for, are largely left out of the process. Moreover, the outcomes are often shielded behind intellectual property law or unaffordable prices. Citizen science and open science are research philosophies that offer an alternative.</p>\n\n<p>Citizen science as an approach is overwhelmingly commonly reduced to an alternative method for collecting data. I was at a conference dedicated to citizen science a few months ago; a full programme, even quite diverse for most standards, and data collection and data quality were all anyone wanted to talk about.</p>\n\n<p><b>Insight only progresses if\xa0we ask the right questions.</b></p>\n\n<p>At the conference not a word was spoken about better ways of actively <strong>listening to citizens</strong> every step of the way. <strong>Closely involving patients</strong> was missing from virtually every research agenda.</p>\n\n<p>In OpenCare I saw plenty of initiatives that are successful at taking citizen-led and open research to the next level. Biohackers are producing <a href="/t/how-open-insulin-works-to-open-source-science-and-medicine/519">open source insulin</a>, researchers in Greece are <a href="/t/openandchange-sc-fy-aplies-and-offers-scientific-knowledge-for-free/495">putting almost-forgotten research to use for everyone</a> and people with motor impairment are coming together with researchers to develop <a href="/t/wehandu-maker-space-for-developing-solutions-for-cases-of-motor-impairment/687">open source neuroprosthetics</a> in maker spaces.</p>\n\n<p>In the grand scheme of things however, these examples are few and far between. But we need more of them. For this, we need to share best practices, learn from each other and ultimately implement real life solutions.

It is called openrampette and is being developed with the Comune di Milano, another opencare partner.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>The group has a discussion about best ideas on the prototype and how to involve citizens of Milan in the design phase. There\xa0 are also needs to develop an app for openrampette.</p>\n\n<p>The discussion goes deep in understanding whether the job consisted in reviewing (advanced prototyping) or development. The problem is that there are not enough indoor skills to develop for mobile. Even IoT (Internet of Things) would have been interesting, but there were no news from the groups.There is a proposal about creating a course for app developers and an internship, but it doesn\'t seem feasible. The UX (User eXperience) approach is a main issue, but a simple \u201cnice, try, next\u201d way cannot work. There is agreement on the fact that the ramp should stay light and not, for instance, 40 kgs heavy.</p>\n\n<p>In a presentation of the project there is a interesting discussion about understanding what is not included in the procedures (the rules enforced by the Municipality), and in the advantage of accessing the database mapping the ramps in the city.</p>\n\n<p>Some hypothetical cases are discussed.</p>\n\n<p>The idea to work on is about a \u201cramp on call\u201d that occupies the ground for a very little time, the one needed for the disabled to access the shop and buy stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise there is the average ramp, already available where big shops, or post offices are.</p>\n\n<p>The results from the questionnaires about the absence of the ramps before many shops in Milan are considered.</p>\n\n<p>There is need to talk with two type of publics; on one side the shop retailers, on the other the customers on wheelchairs. There is the proposal of a survey before and after the meetings.</p>\n\n<p>Some last work is put on schedule for the end of august, as prototyping, the website, documents, the wiki, the video, etc..</p>\n\n<p>All the effort is designed for the local side of the city and then it might be replayed in further city contexts.</p>\n\n<p>A solution for \u201ccalling\u201d the ramp would be to create a button to push.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openrampette&amp;src=tyah" rel="nofollow noopener"></a></p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a02f65bd6a5061c4878e93cf13cd31ab0f50e5d0.jpg" width="682" height="500"></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Communication and promotion issues in co-designing engagement of citizens (disabled and retailers mostly) are a priority.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of a call is being discussed; a container in order to face by degrees what is to be included.

On openrampette many questions are raised about how dealing with the processes.

I mostly remember him for knowing probably all brand new, absurd Twitter accounts, and being able to quote quite a lot of their content.</p>\n\n<p>Then I have learned a bit more - and the more unveiled, the more impressive it got. There is a great reason for us to team up and work on the challenge together: Hacking, internet security, and medical devices. He knows a lot about that stuff.</p>\n\n<p>\xc9ireann with his friend, Dr. Marie Moe started investigating the security of pacemakers - as Marie\'s life actually depends on a little instrument that generates each of her heartbeats. And runs\xa0on a proprietary code. This means she has to implicitly trust the programmers, and despite her and Eireann\u2019s years of assessing devices for security holes, they wouldn\u2019t normally be \u201callowed\u201d to investigate the security of such devices.</p>\n\n<p>This implies how little a regular customer of similar devices is informed about the ways they work, what protocols and tools they use, where their data is stored, etc. It has everything to do with person\'s safety - and still, companies keep most of the key information secret from the users, making them more vulnerable.</p>\n\n<p>I suggest you watch this <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7273-unpatchable#video&amp;amp;t=68" rel="nofollow noopener">great video</a> from 32C3, where Marie and \xc9ireann tell about their journey.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, the issue of safety transcends this case and applies to a whole range of tools that increasingly improve our quality of life and longevity. The security flaws are potentially causing exactly the opposite, making for a health/life hazard. There are concerns about privacy too, where your medical data flows around the world to companies that may or may not be taking measures to protect it.</p>\n\n<p>But that\'s not all - \xc9ireann works also as an advisor for European Network for Cyber Security (ENISA), has founded <a href="http://www.concinnity-risks.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.concinnity-risks.com/</a>, and works as a Senior Risk Researcher at Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies. He is loosely affiliated with <a href="https://www.iamthecavalry.org" rel="nofollow noopener">I Am The Cavalry</a>, a cyber security movement, whose motto is \u201cSafer. Sooner. Together.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He contributes to our <a href="/en/openandchangecare">OPENandChange</a> application vast expertise in the security of medical devices, and embedded devices. He will be helping DIY makers, programmers, and engineers with training on how to build safer code, and what standards they will want to comply with to produce products for different markets. He\'s also offering insight into vulnerability research and standards-based research, contributing safety and transparency knowledge to this huge, open swarm OPENandChange wants to become. Lastly, he loves the idea of preparing a consumer training and equipping people who rely on medical devices with knowledge and clear questions they can ask about their own devices.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, \xc9ireann has just been announced an <a href="https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/open-web-fellows/fellows2016" rel="nofollow noopener">Open Web Fellow</a> for Privacy International and he will be taking the word out about our idea while advocating for open cyberspace.</p>', u'post_id': 712, u'user_id': 3180, u'timestamp': u'2016-08-03 11:41:57', u'title': u"\xc9ireann Leverett, the security wizard who's joining OPEN&Change"}, {u'content': u'<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/162811723" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" title="How do we DIY welfare when systems fail?" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe>\n\n<h2>We will imagine and enact the future of care together.</h2>\n\n<p><strong>What is it:</strong>\xa0A 3-day conference and expo on the topic of health\xa0and social innovations by communities.

Additionally, <strong>any attempt to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care</strong>, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The purpose of the OpenCare PopUp Village is to demonstrate that this is indeed possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>During the past 12 <span>\xa0</span> months, we have driven a transnational research project on the future of health and social care.</strong> Through <a href="http://opencare.cc">OpenCare</a> <strong>we have connected with hundreds of partners, investigating radical solutions to social and healthcare systems under strain</strong>, failing to cater to the needs of growing and ageing populations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>These solutions are often under-the-radar initiatives</strong> - from open source devices for echography to peer-to-peer suicide prevention schemes; from building alternatives to expensive proprietary medical instruments to decentralising the science and production of essential drugs such as insulin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Many of them involve neither state\xa0nor private sector support or funding</strong>. Some are completely informal, some being run by only one hard-working individual. They hunger for peer support and opportunities to collaborate; during the year we have seen them forming partnerships and sharing their ideas and practices, all as a side effect of meeting on our online platform.</p>\n\n<p><strong>With members in over 30 countries and 4 continents, we\xa0are currently building a network of opencare cities to scale up the initiative with us. As well as committed partners willing to bring in their own resources as an investment in an exciting new venture. </strong></p>\n\n<p>The OpenCare PopUp Village will be a series of participant built festivals, with project demonstrations and a vibrant community spirit. <strong>Our ambition is to connect local actors in your country, with peers from all over the planet.</strong> Before the physical gatherings even start, a lot of preparation happens openly online. This means <strong>there is plenty of room for partners and attendees to shape the content, or for taking ownership of spotlight themes.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For more information: </strong>Contact\xa0<a href="mailto:community@edgeryders.eu">community@edgeryders.eu</a>, or come to one of informal weekly online\xa0video calls: Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays at 18:00 CET\xa0<a href="https://hangouts.google.com/call/in6dfwadzfdsldfynvnsatf75me">here</a>\xa0.</p>', u'post_id': 6188, u'user_id': 8, u'timestamp': u'2017-03-07 15:08:47', u'title': u'Open Call for Cities and Regions'}, {u'content': u'<p>Francis is new to the project and arrived a little earlier to give his input. He can help us with mass spectrometry and other analysis methods to determine if we\u2019re working with insulin.

We should clear this out at some point.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tHow much research did CCL do on this?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tDo they have an expert looking into it?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tMassimiliano will contact experts in Belgium to hear their opinion.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>A discussion on the communication aspect of the project: the main takeaway is that it has to be for a specific goal. It seems like now, we can get by with almost no budget. We can get a lot of stuff via-via, if all options go through. There\u2019s no point in doing eg. a crowdfunding for very low amounts. We don\u2019t have a real call to action yet, so we risk wasting opportunities. We\u2019re still \u201ctalking about things we\u2019re about to do but are still a little uncertain\u201d, rather than \u201cthings we\u2019ve done/are doing\u201d. The story misses some power for now and we need to clear stuff out.</p>\n\n<p>When we need serious budget, and have a concrete call to action, we should plan things carefully to time them right, tell the right story. Arne points out the importance of having a website, an email address and perhaps a legal structure when there is more money involved. This in order to look more legit and to not burden other organizations with the administrative aspect.</p>\n\n<p>Angela and Massimiliano think that talking about the history of insulin and diabetes, with fascinating stories, will work well for the educational aspect.</p>\n\n<h3>Timeline &amp; actions</h3>\n\n<p>We drafted a rough timeline in ideal conditions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t12 May: received bacterial samples, start culturing</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t31 May: successful culturing, start extraction of compounds &amp; plan analysis</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t31 August: finished analysis runs &amp; made follow-up plans</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>We\u2019ll try to minimize delays by leaning on the practical experience CCL already collected, to avoid failures in lab work.</p>\n\n<p>Winnie will find out protocols/shipping</p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" href="/u/arnepauwels">@arnepauwels</a> will figure out if OBL will be available when the samples arrive and in the summer</p>\n\n<p><a class="mention" href="/u/rita">@Rita</a> will collect the consumables when we know more about the protocols</p>\n\n<p><strong>Next time we meet on April 26th, 8pm @ ReaGent!</strong></p>', u'post_id': 6253, u'user_id': 3362, u'timestamp': u'2017-04-13 10:54:09', u'title': u'Team meeting notes 12.04.17'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 822, u'user_id': 3576, u'timestamp': u'2017-04-11 21:02:32', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hi everyone!</p>\n\n<p>I\'d like to set up a discussion on the outreach aspect of the project. I feel like people have heard about insulin and diabetes and they vaguely know it has something to do with sugar and stabbing yourself (In Flanders, when people have diabetes, they have \'The Sugar\').</p>\n\n<p>So we have the opportunity to address that through this project.</p>\n\n<p>The way I see it, the content would fall within these 3 categories and I think it would be cool to do one project in each:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Hardcore education: a clear but accurate rendering of what diabetes is and how insulin works, on the molecular level and how OpenInsuline is approaching it. Scientifcally driven, but clear and accessible. -- Medium: a wiki, a blog, a video, an infographic, ...</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>General outreach: A brief and general overview of diabetes and insuline, that describes the problems and solution. Here we could rely on metaphors, alternate non-scientific imagery and pop culture outcasts to paint a picture with layman\'s terms. The storytelling is strong in this one. -- Medium: a song, a meme stream, a video, an infographic, an app, ...</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Awereness: The aim here is for diabetes to reclaim the spotlight, without going into detail and without there being an obivous \'lesson\'. This calls for a unique approach in terms of medium/execution and there has to be a synergy between the message and the medium as well. Ideally we can find a medium with which diabetes hasn\'t been presented yet. Medium: VR, a stick figure game, a comic, an open mic night with diabetes patients, ...</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>I think it will also be important to have the outcome of each category refer to the other ones, if we decide to tickmark every category. If we write a blog, we can urge to \'check out this silly thing we made\'; if we write a song, the interested can find more info in our wiki, etc\xa0</p>\n\n<p>So maybe we can start with coming up with some options for each category and build from there?</p>\n\n<p>Hoping\xa0to have been constructive,</p>\n\n<p>Greets</p>\n\n<p>ND</p>\n\n<p><a href="/t/openvillage/788"></a></p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284.png" class="lightbox" title="banner_0.png"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284_1_690x85.png" width="690" height="85"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">banner_0.png</span><span class="informations">728x90 28.5 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p></p>', u'post_id': 6234, u'user_id': 3426, u'timestamp': u'2017-04-06 12:59:03', u'title': u'Open Insulin - Educational Outreach'}, {u'content': u'<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/5602271e41da4f44c87c6cd42d3dd6b320a22cf2" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5602271e41da4f44c87c6cd42d3dd6b320a22cf2.png" class="lightbox" title="1_7.png"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/5602271e41da4f44c87c6cd42d3dd6b320a22cf2_1_690x345.png" width="690" height="345"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">1_7.png</span><span class="informations">1024x512 60.1 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>Join the #openvillage drop in video chat ! </strong>Today and every Wednesday at 18:00 CET <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/call/in6dfwadzfdsldfynvnsatf75me">here</a></p>\n\n<h2>About</h2>\n\n<p><a href="/t/openvillage-festival/535">OpenVillage</a> is a participant-run festival.

Distribute human resources across different care contexts.</p>\n\n<p>These technologies are connectors: they help string together and coordinate human efforts. <strong>At Edgeryders, we have resolved to put this lesson into practice.

Starting from the second half of the 20th century, developed countries switched to systems where the care providers were professionals, working for the government and modern corporations.</p>\n\n<p>This new solution has achieved brilliant results, based on the deployment of scientific knowledge and technology.<strong>\xa0</strong>However, over the past 20 years it has come under growing strain: the demand for professional care (health care, social care, daycare for children, care for elderly people\u2026) seems limitless, but the resources our economies allocate to it clearly are not. Additionally, any attempt to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are attempting to do just that. Meet the OpenCarers will showcare the results of OpenCare, a two-year, 1.6 million euro research project to design and prototype new care services. \xa0By the end of this project we will have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>collected experiences of community-driven care services</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>validated them through open discussion, both online and offline.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>augmented them with state-of-the-art maker technology (3D printing, laser cutting, biohacking\u2026)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>combined everything we learn into the design and prototype of next generation community-driven care services.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is way too ambitious for us to do alone, so we are doing it with everybody, leveraging collective intelligence. The whole process is \u2013 and will stay \u2013 open to anyone who wants to participate. We operate under a social contract to acknowledge each and every contribution; we do not make participants into a crowd of rightless volunteers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Care is deeply human.

Not for some unknown person in some distant land, either. For friends and family members, people in our communities, right here. Something had to be done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We saw people coming together, stepping into the breach.</strong> Communities were taking up the role of care providers, making it work where neither the state nor private business could. They were doing amazing things. Hackers were making open sourced, internet-enabled glucose monitors for children with diabetes. Belgian trauma therapists set up mobile studios and drove them to refugee camps in Greece, to help bereaved refugees. Bipolar 1 patients found and helped each other fight back suicidal tendencies. Biologists and biohackers were trying to invent a cheap, open source process to make insulin. American activists were encouraging each other to eat healthy food and exercise by doing it together.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We started </strong><strong>a research project</strong><strong>\xa0to take a good look inside these and many other stories. </strong>We wanted to learn what these initiatives have in common, and how we could make more. That project is called OpenCare; it is now in its second year. Results are still coming through, but one thing is already clear:</p>\n\n<p><em>It\'s all about humans.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Community provision of care services needs humans: \xa0more, better prepared, volunteers. People prepared to teach each other skills.</strong> \xa0Therapists to help volunteers in need of trauma support. So, the highest-impact technologies are those that help bring people together. Share knowledge. Distribute human resources across different care contexts. These technologies are connectors: they help string together and coordinate human efforts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This intuition is fundamental. It goes even beyond care.</strong> And it makes sense: we are, after all, the 99%. We have little money and power. We have no large companies, fancy foundations, prestigious universities. But we do have each other. We will thrive, if we can collaborate. But there\'s a problem: collaboration is expensive, and hard to monetise. So, any technology that makes it more efficient is going to make a difference.</p>\n\n<p><strong>At Edgeryders, we have resolved to put this lesson into practice. We are doing it by hacking the most fundamental connecting technology of all: the home.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We dream of a new kind of space, that can be the </strong><strong>hearth</strong><strong> for our families but still be open to the broader world.</strong> Where the door is not a barrier to keep the world out, but a gateway to a global network.<strong> </strong>Where we can live, and work, and sometimes work with the people we live with, and live with our co-workers. Where people are welcome to stay for one day, or a lifetime. Where spending even just an hour in good heart ensures you will never be a stranger again. Where we can develop our talent, learn new skills, get better at what we do. Where we can create for each other a healthy, friendly, cosmopolitan environment and, yes, take care of each other.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We have dreamt this dream before. In its previous iteration, we called it the unMonastery. </strong>We prototyped in 2014, in the Italian city of Matera. That experience taught us much. We learned that a live/work space can not be too close to the needs of a single client. Neither can it be dependent on the grant cycle. It needs to be financially self-sustaining, and benefit several projects and lines of business. We also learned how important it is to be diverse, open and outward-looking for fresh air and fresh ideas to circulate at all times.</p>\n\n<p>The unMonastery also got many things right. The most important one is this: we went ahead and tried it. Planning and due diligence are necessary, but trying things out makes for richer learning.</p>\n\n<p>So, we are not going to keep dreaming about a new space. Instead, <strong>we have decided to roll out </strong><strong><strong>a second</strong></strong><strong> iteration. Right now.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are calling it The Reef.</p>\n\n<p>Coral reefs are structures built by tiny animals, corals. They serve as the home, anchoring point, hiding place, hunting ground to thousands of species. Algae, seaweeds, fish, molluscs all cooperate with, compete with, eat, feed each other. As they do so, they benefit the corals, who gain access to nutrients (reefs exist in nutrient-poor tropical waters).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Like coral reefs, our new space will draw strength from diversity and symbiosis.</strong> Different people will bring in different skills, access to different networks, different personalities. And Edgeryders itself (a social enterprise, so a creature of a different species) will live in symbiosis with the space and the individuals that live in it. It will pay rent, subsidising those who live there; in return, it will be able to use the space for its own purposes: office, coworking space, venue for small events. We also want to offer some form of access to a broad network of people right from the start.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We ran the numbers and we are sure we can make it work.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are going to start with a small-scale prototype: a Brussels loft, with four bedrooms, common living area, office, courtyard.\xa0<a href="/u/noemi"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/noemi">@Noemi</a>\xa0,\xa0<a href="/u/nadia"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/nadia">@Nadia</a>\xa0and <a class="mention" href="/u/alberto">@Alberto</a> are going to be full-time residents; one more room will host temporary residents. We are going live on May 1st 2017, and try it out for one year. We are already looking for a (much) larger space to move into in spring 2018 if the experiment goes well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you are considering being part of the experiment, or curious about learning more, get in touch.</strong> We are planning a "<a href="/t/building-the-reef/6205">Building the Reef</a>" track within the \xa0OpenVillage Festival where we, together, will design the physical space, its financing model, and the activities therein \u2013 from business to fitness and personal development. The track is open to people who, like us, are willing to put some \u201cskin in the game\u201d by becoming founding members.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why become a founding member?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What we individually get out of a membership in the Reef is access to\xa0unique opportunities to develop skills and behaviours needed for living and working well with others.

Biologists and biohackers were trying to invent a cheap, open source process to make insulin. American activists were encouraging each other to eat healthy food and exercise by doing it together.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We started </strong><strong>a research project</strong><strong>\xa0to take a good look inside these and many other stories. </strong>We wanted to learn what these initiatives have in common, and how we could make more. That project is called OpenCare; it is now in its second year. Results are still coming through, but one thing is already clear:</p>\n\n<p><em>It\'s all about humans.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Community provision of care services needs humans: \xa0more, better prepared, volunteers. People prepared to teach each other skills.</strong> \xa0Therapists to help volunteers in need of trauma support. So, the highest-impact technologies are those that help bring people together. Share knowledge. Distribute human resources across different care contexts. These technologies are connectors: they help string together and coordinate human efforts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This intuition is fundamental. It goes even beyond care.</strong> And it makes sense: we are, after all, the 99%. We have little money and power. We have no large companies, fancy foundations, prestigious universities. But we do have each other. We will thrive, if we can collaborate. But there\'s a problem: collaboration is expensive, and hard to monetise. So, any technology that makes it more efficient is going to make a difference.</p>\n\n<p><strong>At Edgeryders, we have resolved to put this lesson into practice. We are doing it by hacking the most fundamental connecting technology of all: the home.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We dream of a new kind of space, that can be the </strong><strong>hearth</strong><strong> for our families but still be open to the broader world.</strong> Where the door is not a barrier to keep the world out, but a gateway to a global network.<strong> </strong>Where we can live, and work, and sometimes work with the people we live with, and live with our co-workers. Where people are welcome to stay for one day, or a lifetime. Where spending even just an hour in good heart ensures you will never be a stranger again. Where we can develop our talent, learn new skills, get better at what we do. Where we can create for each other a healthy, friendly, cosmopolitan environment and, yes, take care of each other.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We have dreamt this dream before. In its previous iteration, we called it the unMonastery. </strong>We prototyped in 2014, in the Italian city of Matera. That experience taught us much. We learned that a live/work space can not be too close to the needs of a single client. Neither can it be dependent on the grant cycle. It needs to be financially self-sustaining, and benefit several projects and lines of business. We also learned how important it is to be diverse, open and outward-looking for fresh air and fresh ideas to circulate at all times.</p>\n\n<p>The unMonastery also got many things right. The most important one is this: we went ahead and tried it. Planning and due diligence are necessary, but trying things out makes for richer learning.</p>\n\n<p>So, we are not going to keep dreaming about a new space. Instead, <strong>we have decided to roll out </strong><strong><strong>a second</strong></strong><strong> iteration. Right now.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are calling it The Reef.</p>\n\n<p>Coral reefs are structures built by tiny animals, corals. They serve as the home, anchoring point, hiding place, hunting ground to thousands of species. Algae, seaweeds, fish, molluscs all cooperate with, compete with, eat, feed each other. As they do so, they benefit the corals, who gain access to nutrients (reefs exist in nutrient-poor tropical waters).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Like coral reefs, our new space will draw strength from diversity and symbiosis.</strong> Different people will bring in different skills, access to different networks, different personalities. And Edgeryders itself (a social enterprise, so a creature of a different species) will live in symbiosis with the space and the individuals that live in it. It will pay rent, subsidising those who live there; in return, it will be able to use the space for its own purposes: office, coworking space, venue for small events. We also want to offer some form of access to a broad network of people right from the start.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We ran the numbers and we are sure we can make it work.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are going to start with a small-scale prototype: a Brussels loft, with four bedrooms, common living area, office, courtyard.\xa0<a href="/u/noemi"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/noemi">@Noemi</a>\xa0,\xa0<a href="/u/nadia"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/nadia">@Nadia</a>\xa0and <a class="mention" href="/u/alberto">@Alberto</a> are going to be full-time residents; one more room will host temporary residents. We are going live on May 1st 2017, and try it out for one year. We are already looking for a (much) larger space to move into in spring 2018 if the experiment goes well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you are considering being part of the experiment, or curious about learning more, get in touch.</strong> We are planning a "<a href="/t/building-the-reef/6205">Building the Reef</a>" track within the \xa0OpenVillage Festival where we, together, will design the physical space, its financing model, and the activities therein \u2013 from business to fitness and personal development. The track is open to people who, like us, are willing to put some \u201cskin in the game\u201d by becoming founding members.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why become a founding member?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What we individually get out of a membership in the Reef is access to\xa0unique opportunities to develop skills and behaviours needed for living and working well with others.

Starting from the second half of the 20th century, developed countries switched to systems where the care providers were professionals, working for the government and modern corporations.</p>\n\n<p>This new solution has achieved brilliant results, based on the deployment of scientific knowledge and technology.<strong> </strong>However, over the past 20 years it has come under growing strain: the demand for professional care (health care, social care, daycare for children, care for elderly people\u2026) seems limitless, but the resources our economies allocate to it clearly are not. Additionally, any attempt to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are attempting to do just that. Meet the OpenCarers will showcare the results of OpenCare, a two-year, 1.6 million euro research project to design and prototype new care services. By the end of this project we will have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>collected experiences of community-driven care services</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>validated them through open discussion, both online and offline.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>augmented them with state-of-the-art maker technology (3D printing, laser cutting, biohacking\u2026)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>combined everything we learn into the design and prototype of next generation community-driven care services.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is way too ambitious for us to do alone, so we are doing it with everybody, leveraging collective intelligence. The whole process is \u2013 and will stay \u2013 open to anyone who wants to participate. We operate under a social contract to acknowledge each and every contribution; we do not make participants into a crowd of rightless volunteers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Care is deeply human. Everyone has </strong><strong>first-hand</strong><strong> experience of it. Even those of us who are not doctors or nurses or caregivers are occasionally patients (even doctors!); we all have first-hand experience of giving and </strong><strong>recieving</strong><strong> care. So, everyone is welcome to join the conversation and the subsequent </strong><strong>prototypes.</strong></p>\n\n<hr><h2>Partner organisations</h2><h2>\xa0</h2>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/c42df3dd45f23cced18fc0ddc2e5bfac811942cf" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c42df3dd45f23cced18fc0ddc2e5bfac811942cf.PNG" class="lightbox" title="opencare Logos_0.PNG"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c42df3dd45f23cced18fc0ddc2e5bfac811942cf_1_690x71.PNG" width="690" height="71"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">opencare Logos_0.PNG</span><span class="informations">1783x185 66.8 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>This track of the OpenVillage has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 688670</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a href="http://opencare.cc/assets/OC-EC-H2020.jpg" class="lightbox" title="OC-EC-H2020.jpg"><img src="http://opencare.cc/assets/OC-EC-H2020.jpg" width="690" height="126"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">OC-EC-H2020.jpg</span><span class="informations">1000x184</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>', u'post_id': 6236, u'user_id': 8, u'timestamp': u'2017-04-06 16:18:37', u'title': u'Meet The OpenCarers Track'}, {u'content': u'<p>A few years ago we started paying close attention to care. Available, affordable health and social care was \u2013 and still is \u2013 unavailable. Not for some unknown person in some distant land, either. For friends and family members, people in our communities, right here. Something had to be done.</p>\n\n<p>We saw people coming together, stepping into the breach. Communities were taking up the role of care providers, making it work where neither the state nor private business could. They were doing amazing things. Hackers were making open sourced, internet-enabled glucose monitors for children with diabetes. Belgian trauma therapists set up mobile studios and drove them to refugee camps in Greece, to help bereaved refugees. Bipolar 1 patients found and helped each other fight back suicidal tendencies. Biologists and biohackers were trying to invent a cheap, open source process to make insulin. American activists were encouraging each other to eat healthy food and exercise by doing it together.</p>\n\n<p>We started a research projects to take a good look inside these and many other stories. We wanted to learn what these initiatives have in common, and how we could make more. That project is called OpenCare; it is now in its second year. Results are still coming through, but one thing is already clear:</p>\n\n<p>It\'s all about humans.</p>\n\n<p>Community provision of care services needs humans: \xa0more, better prepared, volunteers. People prepared to teach each other skills. \xa0Therapists to help volunteers in need of trauma support. So, the highest-impact technologies are those that help bring people together. Share knowledge. Distribute human resources across different care contexts. These technologies are connectors: they help string together and coordinate human efforts.</p>\n\n<p>This intuition is fundamental. It goes even beyond care. And it makes sense: we are, after all, the 99%. We have little money and power. We have no large companies, fancy foundations, prestigious universities. But we do have each other. We will thrive, if we can collaborate. But there\'s a problem: collaboration is expensive, and hard to monetise. So, any technology that makes it more efficient is going to make a difference.</p>\n\n<p><strong>At Edgeryders, we have resolved to put this lesson into practice. We are doing it by hacking the most fundamental connecting technology of all: the home.</strong></p>\n\n<p>We dream of a new kind of space, that can be the hearth for our families but still be open to the broader world. Where the door is not a barrier to keep the world out, but a gateway to a global network. Where we can live, and work, and sometimes work with the people we live with, and live with our co-workers. Where people are welcome to stay for one day, or a lifetime. Where spending even just an hour in good heart ensures you will never be a stranger again. Where we can develop our talent, learn new skills, get better at what we do. Where we can create for each other a healthy, friendly, cosmopolitan environment and, yes, take care of each other.</p>\n\n<p>We have dreamt this dream before. In its previous iteration, we called it the unMonastery. We prototyped in 2014, in the Italian city of Matera. That experience taught us much. We learned that a life/work space can not be too close to the needs of a single client. Neither can it be dependent on the grant cycle. It needs to be financially self-sustaining, and benefit several projects and lines of business. We also learned how important it is to be diverse, open and outward-looking for fresh air and fresh ideas to circulate at all times.</p>\n\n<p>The unMonastery also got many things right. The most important one is this: we went ahead and tried it. Planning and due diligence are necessary, but trying things out makes for richer learning.</p>\n\n<p>So, we are not going to keep dreaming about a new space. Instead, we have decided to roll out a second iteration. Right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We are calling it The Reef.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Coral reefs are structures built by tiny animals, corals. They serve as the home, anchoring point, hiding place, hunting ground to thousands of species. Algae, seaweeds, fish, molluscs all cooperate with, compete with, eat, feed each other. As they do so, they benefit the corals, who gain access to nutrients (reefs exist in nutrient-poor tropical waters).</p>\n\n<p>Like coral reefs, our new space will draw strength from diversity and symbiosis. Different people will bring in different skills, access to different networks, different personalities. And Edgeryders itself (a social enterprise, so a creature of a different species) will live in symbiosis with the space and the individuals that live in it. It will pay rent, subsidising those who live there; in return, it will be able to use the space for its own purposes: office, coworking space, venue for small events. We also want to offer some form of access to a broad network of people right from the start.</p>\n\n<p>We ran the numbers and we are sure we can make it work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We are going to start with a small-scale prototype: a Brussels loft, with four bedrooms, common living area, office, courtyard. </strong><a class="mention" href="/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> , <a class="mention" href="/u/nadia">@Nadia</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/alberto">@Alberto</a> are going to be full-time residents; one more room will host temporary residents. We are going live on May 1st 2017, and try it out for one year. We are already looking for a (much) larger space to move into in spring 2018 if the experiment goes well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you are considering being part of the experiment, or curious about learning more, get in touch. We are planning a "building the Reef" track within to OpenVillage where we, together, will design the physical space, its financing model, and the activites therein \u2013 from business to fitness and personal development. The track is open to people who, like us, are willing to put some \u201cskin in the game\u201d by becoming founding members.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Why become a founding member?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>What we get out of a membership in the Reef\xa0is access to\xa0unique opportunities to develop skills and behaviours needed for living and working well with others:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Use of our coworking space and guest room (incl. public transport &amp; sim card)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Project development &amp; partnership-building support</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Invitation to participate in Skill Development Masterclasses</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Invitation to networking dinners, parties,\xa0and adventures</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Full unlimited access passes to our Annual Community Summits (e.g. OpenVIllage Festival)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What you will learn</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>how to present &amp; sell your ideas</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>community building and management</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>intercultural communication</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>resolving and limiting damage from conflicts</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>building practical skills like permaculture, carpentry and plumbing</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>improving nutrition and physical wellbeing\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>recognising and dealing with common psychosocial problems e.g. depression</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What each one of us contributes</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>When becoming a member:</strong>\xa0money to\xa0cover running costs (for a breakdown of these go here)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>While in the house</strong>, as resident and/or visiting: share costs of collective meals\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>On the online community platform:</strong>\xa0feedback and knowledge to support one another\'s work</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Our approach towards community and support-building implies trust and a spirit of generosity, rather than transactional relationships.\xa0</strong>Members are contributors and not service recipients.

Who gives it?</h2>\n\n<p>"The state is the main care providers," say many Europeans. And sure, the welfare state is a major safety net in their societies. "Businesses are the main providers" many Americans reply. They too have a point: their insurance companies, hospitals and clinics - most of these are businesses.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, that\'s not the whole story. Care models are failing: The per capita health care expenditure grows faster than GDP. We need to spend an ever-greater part of our resources just to stay well. Under pressure to get care, the edges of society respond by getting creative.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This event is part of OpenCare, a research project on how to make health- and social care accessible for all, open source, privacy-friendly and participatory.\xa0</strong>We start from the assumption that state and private institutions will be unable to meet the demands for care in the 21st century and that new\xa0open, participatory, community-based methods are required.</p>\n\n<p><strong>At the\xa0Openvillage festival\xa0</strong>we bring together many #opencare projects into a demo of a new health and social care system powered by open source, community-driven solutions.We are interested in what you already are doing, and what we can do together.</p>\n\n<p><a href="/opencare-research">Meet the Opencare Research Team</a></p>\n\n<hr><h2>\xa0</h2><h2>Partners</h2>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/bcd1aa8320a7b7d80bd0ca246f2288f36c8ca071" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bcd1aa8320a7b7d80bd0ca246f2288f36c8ca071.PNG" class="lightbox" title="Logos opencare.PNG"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bcd1aa8320a7b7d80bd0ca246f2288f36c8ca071_1_690x127.PNG" width="690" height="127"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Logos opencare.PNG</span><span class="informations">1363x252 59 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>This project has received funding from the European Union\'s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no 688670</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/4893c749d51cf8eac39c34f6f2e751559db219c2" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4893c749d51cf8eac39c34f6f2e751559db219c2.jpg" class="lightbox" title="OC-EC-H2020_0.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/4893c749d51cf8eac39c34f6f2e751559db219c2_1_690x126.jpg" width="690" height="126"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">OC-EC-H2020_0.jpg</span><span class="informations">1000x184 23.5 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<hr><h2>#OpenVillage Festival</h2>\n\n<p>Follow us:</p>\n\n<p>\xa0<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1565289333786291/">Facebook </a>\xa0\xa0<a href="http://twitter.com/edgeryders">Twitter </a>\xa0\xa0<a href="http://opencare.us2.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=2426561089e1f5ab32da252cd&amp;id=566925d23f">Newsletter</a></p>\n\n<p>General inquiries:</p>\n\n<p><a href="mailto:community@edgeryders.eu">community@edgeryders.eu</a></p>\n\n<p>Contributions &amp; Partnerships:</p>\n\n<p><a href="mailto:company@edgeryders.eu">company@edgeryders.eu</a></p>\n\n<p>\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 821, u'user_id': 8, u'timestamp': u'2017-04-06 12:56:43', u'title': u'OpenVillage Festival (imported from former Drupal group)'}, {u'content': u'<p>While we are adding final touches to the OpenVillage launch, we plan a personalized message to our partners that includes:</p>\n\n<p>1) Save the Date and register for OpenVillage</p>\n\n<p>2) Take on Communication and Business modeling (?) roles in preparation for it:\xa05\xa0memberships available (opencall upcoming)</p>\n\n<p>3) Take on Curation role: Fellowships (see main menu link)</p>\n\n<p>4) Maker Residency in Milano (see main menu link)</p>\n\n<p>These are the concrete\xa0opportunities for continuing the work which has been done in\xa0openandchange.</p>\n\n<p>Am I missing something?</p>', u'post_id': 6217, u'user_id': 3, u'timestamp': u'2017-03-27 12:15:43', u'title': u'[Event launch] Follow up with OpenandChange partners'}, {u'content': u'<p><strong>Context</strong></p>\n\n<p>In recent years Milan citizens have developed needs that the City of milan is no longer able to cope with. Available data tell us that welfare services are directed to a minority of citizens, creating a gap with all the others.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But what are the main changes taking place?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The aging population;</p></li>\n<li><p>The reduction in resources due to the economic and financial crisis;</p></li>\n<li><p>The changing role of the family, its components and its characteristics;</p></li>\n<li><p>The question of the role of youth in society;</p></li>\n<li><p>The increasing multiculturalism.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In particular in Milan:</p>\n\n<p>SENIOR CITIZENS</p>\n\n<p>In Milan, the ultra elderly residents aged over 60 are 394 673 (about 30%), mostly women (233,863). Of these 25% are people alone, who then often they face the last part of life in solitude.</p>\n\n<p>Among these are the "very elderly" (over 80) are 94,330.</p>\n\n<p>The elderly non self-sufficient are about 40,000 and they have a lot of care needs and the main caregivers are \xa0familiars (usually sons) and health and social services.</p>\n\n<p>These numbers also explain the growing significance of the phenomenon of the informal care market, the caregivers for elderly people.</p>\n\n<p>The phenomenon is significant in Milan if you consider that in the city are estimated around 32,000 caregivers, both legal and illegal.</p>\n\n<p>It \'also important to note that only 25% of the 39,000 non self sufficient elderly people living in Milan receive formal care provided by Municipality.</p>\n\n<p>WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?</p>\n\n<p>THE ROLE OF WOMEN</p>\n\n<p>The role of women/ mother in Milan \xa0is increasingly complex. Just think that in Milan, in 2011, appear to be residents 383,221 women aged between 25 and 65 years and that the female employment rate in the city is 62.70%.</p>\n\n<p>The above described demographic change also determines a situation where women who are 40 years old today can expect to share about 22 years of their lives with at least one elderly parent, 4 years longer than those born in 1960 and 10 years more than women born in 1940.</p>\n\n<p>The Milanese women are, therefore, for most working women, whose problems of conciliation between family and work are even more marked than women of other cities of Italy.</p>\n\n<p>Children in Milan between 0 and 6 years old are 83,605 of which only 6,902 are enrolled in pre-schools or nurseries and only 5,600 are enrolled in pre-school services and after-school primary school.</p>\n\n<p>WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?</p>\n\n<p>FRAGMENTATION OF RESOURCES</p>\n\n<p>We also found a strong fragmentation between public funds used for care and a \xa0lack of coordination. 43% of these resources comes from the State, Region, Municipality and Local Public Health Agency, \xa0the other part are cash resources that come from INPS (National Insurance Contributions).</p>\n\n<p>The project \u201cWelfare of all\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The idea is to create the conditions to make sure that everyone has access to opportunities provided by the welfare, regardless of economic conditions, and that anyone can have an active role \xa0in the welfare and thus responsible for the improvement of society. Therefore the name of the project: Welfare of all.</p>\n\n<p>This approach seems to us really innovative. Adolfo Ceretti and Roberto Cornelli (partner of our project with the <a href="http://www.cnpds.it/eng/index.php?link=" rel="nofollow noopener">National Centre for Prevention and Social Defence</a>) told us: "The claim of recognition of civil and social rights, after having supported the gradual expansion of the Western democracies, becomes more and more an individual claim that tends to exclude, in the name of "my own right", those of others. "My" right to public housing, the provision of "my" child daycare, and even the right to receive adequate medical care is seen in contrast with the rights of others. We prefer to support the removal from the list of those who "are not as much citizen as I am "- rather than to claim services that reach everyone.</p>\n\n<p>In a context where human relationships are more rarefied, the solidaristic relations are weak, the gap between social segments is dangerously exploding. Insecurity and uncertainty have made the idea of \u200b\u200bcommunity something relative and fragile. "</p>\n\n<p>Wemi is developing an online platform that enables simple access to home care services of the City, making it possible for citizens to request new services, or in different ways, creating new solutions together, giving you the chance to find personalized answers.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://wemi.milano.it/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://wemi.milano.it/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://wemi.milano.it/</a></p>\n\n<p>We realized also two territorial platforms, ie two listening spaces for citizens in the aim to promote the sharing of offers and needs among citizens. The territorial platforms perform the same function of the digital platform but in three different physical locations.</p>\n\n<p>In these spaces people are helped to find the services they need, but also they are encouraged to share needs and services between groups of citizens, in the aim to aggregate the needs and provide shared answers . These services then work directly with families and traditional third sector associations.</p>\n\n<p>Online and physical platforms are innovative tools because they force the entire system to rethink: the City of Milan has to change its vision of citizens and the world of the third sector needs to open up to new citizens and think again an adequate business model.</p>\n\n<p>Finally thanks to some ideas \xa0received during some design sessions WEMI is implementing two pilot projects: \u201cApartment Block Welfare\u201d, with apartment block caregivers/home helps, and \u201cSchool Welfare\u201d, working with local schools, with a view to better integrating welfare provision.</p>\n\n<p>Apartment Block Welfare</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Oi7QuWlB0Rb57UEkpqSyhhe0hVHz_gs3fBX655FVr6KwBBPiNX2Pg3YtjTu_IqcyMi2vBZUISgGAVka9L1AWyvTT2QqXSpL_Mpl7dDdfp5azYnPR3RDpOvSbZuXTUMMHI7K3WPFf" class="lightbox" title="Oi7QuWlB0Rb57UEkpqSyhhe0hVHz_gs3fBX655FVr6KwBBPiNX2Pg3YtjTu_IqcyMi2vBZUISgGAVka9L1AWyvTT2QqXSpL_Mpl7dDdfp5azYnPR3RDpOvSbZuXTUMMHI7K3WPFf" rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt="Screenshot_3.png" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Oi7QuWlB0Rb57UEkpqSyhhe0hVHz_gs3fBX655FVr6KwBBPiNX2Pg3YtjTu_IqcyMi2vBZUISgGAVka9L1AWyvTT2QqXSpL_Mpl7dDdfp5azYnPR3RDpOvSbZuXTUMMHI7K3WPFf" width="690" height="165"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Oi7QuWlB0Rb57UEkpqSyhhe0hVHz_gs3fBX655FVr6KwBBPiNX2Pg3YtjTu_IqcyMi2vBZUISgGAVka9L1AWyvTT2QqXSpL_Mpl7dDdfp5azYnPR3RDpOvSbZuXTUMMHI7K3WPFf</span><span class="informations">1334x319</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>Financial education for social operators</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ie9ZQmuFJj9sOEnqh2cTIzv7YQHBXg5ZYjCGPymZVdcahqZIDDh58RjSVqYmRp1kfdJ0v0ZaLujlSw7RdcyRif1Z6h1roVbiiGhCTYkconDmTpC9m5cZrc_CLNuGKjg2UOm_Hgf4" class="lightbox" title="Ie9ZQmuFJj9sOEnqh2cTIzv7YQHBXg5ZYjCGPymZVdcahqZIDDh58RjSVqYmRp1kfdJ0v0ZaLujlSw7RdcyRif1Z6h1roVbiiGhCTYkconDmTpC9m5cZrc_CLNuGKjg2UOm_Hgf4" rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt="Screenshot_4.png" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ie9ZQmuFJj9sOEnqh2cTIzv7YQHBXg5ZYjCGPymZVdcahqZIDDh58RjSVqYmRp1kfdJ0v0ZaLujlSw7RdcyRif1Z6h1roVbiiGhCTYkconDmTpC9m5cZrc_CLNuGKjg2UOm_Hgf4" width="690" height="173"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Ie9ZQmuFJj9sOEnqh2cTIzv7YQHBXg5ZYjCGPymZVdcahqZIDDh58RjSVqYmRp1kfdJ0v0ZaLujlSw7RdcyRif1Z6h1roVbiiGhCTYkconDmTpC9m5cZrc_CLNuGKjg2UOm_Hgf4</span><span class="informations">1303x328</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>Which are the main difficulties that we found?</p>\n\n<p>We found different kind of difficulties.</p>\n\n<p>From the point of view of the City of Milan we\u2019re working with new tools that are very different from the typical ones. For example, we had to think about a new way to communicate services to citizens, trying to build a new visual identity system with the Department of Design at the Politecnico. Moreover we need to build a new language with the traditional actors (cooperatives, NGOs..) that can be understood by citizens \xa0(not technical language).</p>\n\n<p>Another difficulty has been to help no profit organizations to think new kind of products, beyond their traditional services in order to be able to answer to new and different needs. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>So the biggest challenge is to get out from traditional logic, in relation to how we think, how we communicate and we distribute services.</p>\n\n<p>We believe that this new way of thinking services might lead to great opportunities, but we still need to prove that this idea is true. So we need to be brave and really believe and work on this idea.</p>\n\n<p>In this sense the role of the Municipality is important because only Municipality can take the risk of innovation and make an investment that the private social agencies alone could not do, as they are forced to face objective difficulties also linked to a long economical crisis.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think? Do you know similar projects? Do you have suggestions for us?</p>\n\n<p>All comments will be useful for building together this difficult road of Welfare innovation.</p>', u'post_id': 563, u'user_id': 3517, u'timestamp': u'2017-01-16 14:49:51', u'title': u'Wemi:City of Milan is going to re-think Care Services in order to create a new Community Welfare'}, {u'content': u'<p>We can have the bacteria soon already.

Because if there\u2019s something wrong, we won\u2019t know where it went wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Rita: we could look at the patents, if there\u2019s mention of detection methods. We can use those if it\u2019s just for validation in this stage.</p>\n\n<p>We will ask around for prices/help from our network as we will need to buy materials at some points.

We can get some stuff viavia though.</p>\n\n<p>Concluding thoughts: we can easily receive the samples, so we\u2019ll get that done asap.

I have some experience in asking donors.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Q. Can we know more about the actual process?</p>\n\n<p>Winnie: the body makes a protein with 4 component: a leader sequence, the A-chain, the C-chain (a spacer, facilitating the A- and B-chains to connect to each other) and the B-chain. In the end, insulin is only made of an A- and B-chain. Manufacturing just A- and B-chains will work, but is very very inefficient, because these two chains do not react with each other easily. The challenge of making insulin is that of increasing the efficiency of this reaction.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The CCL innovation to do that is something called a Leucine zipper, that attaches to both chains (which are produced by two different genes), and attracts copies of itself like a magnet. Leucine zipper helps A- and B-chains find each other.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Round of presentations. Lots of bioengineers-biochemists.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Alberto: How is it going to work? Do you guys specialize in one phase of the process?\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Winnie: CCL would like us to purify and validate with HPLC. That also means validating that their bacteria (E. coli with DNA insertion) breed true in our lab as well as theirs. One problem is: how do we get the bacteria to begin with? The Sydney lab has solved this problem, we have not tackled it yet. There are legal restrictions. Maybe we could go through Open BioLab, which is part of a university.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Federica: do we have access to CCL results?</p>\n\n<p>Winnie: yes. Everything is on Google Drive. We need to ask what the policy for access is. We also need to be clear on the license of this stuff, i.e. terms of reuse for publications etc.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>(Technical discussion of the process as developed by CCL. The gist of it: making proinsulin seems easy, but cutting out the relevant part and purifying the resulting insulin from the junk is going to be harder).\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Arne: how long does this take? Engineering efficient microfactories looks like a very big deal.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Winnie: we are not engineering yet. We are going for a proof of concept. Our proof is complete when we have a viable open sourced process for making insulin that works <em>in the lab</em>. Making it work <em>in production</em> is not on the table yet. CCL got about halfway through it in 18 months. Imagine another 12-18 months to complete the proof of concept.</p>\n\n<h3>Notes afterwards</h3>\n\n<p>Winnie: the next steps I gathered from the conversation were to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Agree on a shared vision and approach (research + communication/education)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Figure out shipping of bacterial sample</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Estimate project costs &amp; timing for crowdfunding/other funding sources</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Get a hold of more OI documentation</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Winnie: you should see more documentation popping up in the Drive over the next few days as I get them from CCL.

Available, affordable health and social care was \u2013 and still is \u2013 unavailable. Not for some unknown person in some distant land, either. For friends and family members, people in our communities, right here. Something had to be done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We saw people coming together, stepping into the breach</strong>. Communities were taking up the role of care providers, making it work where neither the state nor private business could. They were doing amazing things. Hackers were making open sourced, internet-enabled glucose monitors for children with diabetes. Belgian trauma therapists set up mobile studios and drove them to refugee camps in Greece, to help bereaved refugees. Bipolar 1 patients found and helped each other fight back suicidal tendencies. Biologists and biohackers were trying to invent a cheap, open source process to make insulin. American activists were encouraging each other to eat healthy food and exercise by doing it together.</p>\n\n<p>We started a research projects to take a good look inside <a href="/en/op3ncare/helping-one-another-to-discover-what-is">these and many other stories</a>. We wanted to learn what these initiatives have in common, and how we could make more. That project is called OpenCare; it is now in its second year. <a href="/t/opencare-what-happened-in-year-1/6073">Results are still coming through</a>, but one thing is already clear:</p>\n\n<blockquote><strong><em>It\'s all about humans.</em></strong></blockquote>\n\n<p>Community provision of care services needs humans: \xa0more, better prepared, volunteers. People prepared to teach each other skills. \xa0Therapists to help volunteers in need of trauma support. So, the highest-impact technologies are those that help bring people together. Share knowledge. Distribute human resources across different care contexts. These technologies are connectors: they help string together and coordinate human efforts.</p>\n\n<p>This intuition is fundamental. It goes even beyond care. And it makes sense: we are, after all, the 99%. We have little money and power. <strong>We have no large companies, fancy foundations, prestigious universities. But we do have each other.</strong> We will thrive, if we can collaborate. But there\'s a problem: collaboration is expensive, and hard to monetise. So, any technology that makes it more efficient is going to make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>At Edgeryders, we have resolved to put this lesson into practice. <strong>We are doing it by hacking the most fundamental connecting technology of all: the home.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We dream of a new kind of space</strong>, that can be the hearth for our families but still be open to the broader world. Where the door is not a barrier to keep the world out, but a gateway to a global network. Where we can live, and work, and sometimes work with the people we live with, and live with our co-workers. Where people are welcome to stay for one day, or a lifetime. Where spending even just an hour in good heart ensures you will never be a stranger again. Where we can develop our talent, learn new skills, get better at what we do. Where we can create for each other a healthy, friendly, cosmopolitan environment and, yes, take care of each other.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We have dreamt this dream before. In its previous iteration, we called it the <a href="/t/unmonastery/315">unMonastery</a></strong>. We prototyped in 2014, in the Italian city of Matera. That experience taught us much. We learned that\xa0a life/work space can not be too close to the needs of a single client. Neither can it be dependent on the grant cycle. It needs to be financially self-sustaining, and benefit several projects and lines of business. We also learned\xa0how important it is to be diverse, open and outward-looking for fresh air and fresh ideas to circulate at all times.</p>\n\n<p>The unMonastery also got many things right. The most important one is this: <em><strong>we went ahead and tried it</strong></em>. Planning and due diligence are necessary, but trying things out makes for richer learning.</p>\n\n<p>So, we are not going to keep dreaming about a new space. Instead, we have decided to roll out\xa0a second iteration. Right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We are calling it The Reef</strong>. Coral reefs are structures built by tiny animals, corals. They serve as the home, anchoring point, hiding place, hunting ground to thousands of species. Algae, seaweeds, fish, molluscs all cooperate with, compete with, eat, feed each other. As they do so, they benefit the corals, who gain access to nutrients (reefs exist in nutrient-poor tropical waters).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Like coral reefs, our new space will draw strength from diversity and symbiosis</strong>. Different people will bring in different skills, access to different networks, different personalities. And Edgeryders itself (a social enterprise, so a creature of a different species) will live in symbiosis with the space and the individuals that live in it. It will pay rent, subsidising those who live there; in return, it will be able to use the space for its own purposes: office, coworking space, venue for small events. We also want to offer some form of access to a broad network of people right from the start.</p>\n\n<p>We ran the numbers and we are sure we can make it work. <strong>We are going to start with a small-scale prototype: a Brussels loft, with four bedrooms, common living area, office, courtyard</strong>. <a class="mention" href="/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> , <a class="mention" href="/u/nadia">@Nadia</a> and I are going to be full-time residents; one more room will host temporary residents. We are going live on May 1st 2017, and try it out for one year. We are already looking for a (much) larger space to move into in spring 2018 if the experiment goes well.</p>\n\n<p>If you are considering being part of the experiment, or curious about learning more, get in touch. We are planning a "building the Reef" track within to OpenVillage where we, together, will design the physical space, its financing model, and the activites therein \u2013 from business to fitness and personal development.</p>\n\n<p>[PRACTICAL INFO GO HERE]</p>', u'post_id': 6215, u'user_id': 4, u'timestamp': u'2017-03-26 19:01:35', u'title': u'Proposed text for launch of Reef track'}, {u'content': u'<p><em>// [Work in Progress]: This wiki is where we prepare information about the events that will be held in the Reef for members, 2017-2018.

We practice a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science">open notebook science</a>.\xa0We don\'t publish only results, but also questions, doubts, within-team disagreements, half-baked ideas. This is made more effective by a specificity of OpenCare:\xa0the community and the team are in separate "rooms" of the same online platform, edgeryders.eu. People who hang around it\xa0can\'t help noticing the stream of research project updates. Some of them engage.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>This was expected. But I was not expecting the magnitude of the effect. 81 people have contributed at least one comment to the research team space. The team\'s own numerosity fluctuates, but it\'s about 20. The others are just people from the community who drop in to ask questions or make suggestions. And they outnumber us three to one.</p>\n\n<p>In the network diagrams, nodes are color- and size coded by in-degree. You can think of in-degree as a measure of the interest that the person\'s contribution elicits in the conversation. By this metric, it is clear that self-selected community members who just jump in\xa0are making a major contribution to the OpenCare research effort. The highest in-degree individuals who are not affiliated with any of the partners are <a class="mention" href="/u/federico_monaco">@Federico_Monaco</a> (ranks 7th by in-degree), <a class="mention" href="/u/rune">@Rune</a> (ranks 13th) and <a class="mention" href="/u/francesco_maria_zava">@Francesco_Maria_ZAVA</a> (ranks 16th).\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The conversation about\xa0OpenCare as a project (to the right of the picture)\xa0is of the same order of magnitude as that about open care as a potential pathway to societal well-being (to the left). It needs to be said, however, that the former has a lot of menial content: agreeing about a time and place to meet, requesting administrative information etc. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>What are the consequences of all this activity? More diversity in research. More space for participation. With a bit of luck, more and higher quality scientific output.\xa0My favourite story is this: a community member, the already mentioned Federico Monaco, has proposed we do a paper together. He had found a call for papers in a journal he follows, and thought it a good fit. His proposal stirred the rest of the team into action. His <a href="/t/call-for-papers-political-forms-and-movements-in-the-digital-era-deadline-for-abstract-submission-february-28-2017/6059">thread</a> received over 50 comments. A\xa0draft abstract was then uploaded onto <a href="/t/abstract-for-political-forms-and-movements-in-the-digital-era-final-feedback-gathering/6103">a public wiki</a>\xa0for community scrutiny and feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Many people sent contributions large and small. The large ones (example: that of\xa0Ezio \u2013 <a href="/t/call-for-papers-political-forms-and-movements-in-the-digital-era-deadline-for-abstract-submission-february-28-2017/6059/47">here</a>) did most of the heavy lifting. But the process had a role also for smaller ones. People like myself, who did not feel confident to step in as co-authors, were able to offer <a href="/t/call-for-papers-political-forms-and-movements-in-the-digital-era-deadline-for-abstract-submission-february-28-2017/6059/48">some small help</a>\xa0without having to take responsbility for the whole thing. Federico led with a firm but light touch, asking everyone who volunteered any thought what role they wanted to play in the paper. For example, <a class="mention" href="/u/yannick">@Yannick</a> \u2013 also\xa0<em>not</em>\xa0a member of the OpenCare team \u2013 was offered co-authorship (but <a href="/t/call-for-papers-political-forms-and-movements-in-the-digital-era-deadline-for-abstract-submission-february-28-2017/6059/17">declined</a>). All of this happened out in the open. As you\xa0read the whole thread, you can see ideas form through the discussion of the co-authors. Collective intelligence about collective intelligence!\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Interdisciplinarity happened quite naturally as a result of the open process. The final submission listed five authors: Federico himself (a medical anthropologist); <a class="mention" href="/u/ezio_manzini">@Ezio_Manzini</a> (a designer for social innovation); <a class="mention" href="/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> (a social scientist); <a class="mention" href="/u/amelia">@Amelia</a> (an ethnographer); myself (a network scientist). How cool is that?</p>\n\n<p>Another advantage of doing things this way is increased accountability to the people who take part\xa0in the main conversation, the one about care. Through the research team forum, they can ask question and make proposals. This should mitigate the perceived risk of researchers taking an exploitative attitude towards people\'s contributions. The operative word here is "perceived". We have the best intentions, but we recognize this is not enough. We are determined to demonstrate them to the community, and transparency goes a long way towards doing it.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I think that, together, we are making OpenCare... open. I had never had the luxury of running a research project with such transparency. I like it a lot, and hope to keep doing so in the future.

In a short time the populations of small countries in the region, Lebanon and Jordan, have grown manyfold (1.1 Million refugees in Lebanon, 630,000 in Jordan - in addition to Palestinian refugees already there). Some reading materials with up to date, detailed information:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Armenia:</strong>\xa0<a href="/t/refugee-care-system-in-armenia-and-how-to-improve-it/5009">Anna\u2019s report from Yerevan</a> is a good introduction.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2ulC5rjYSncOTRoZThTWlljWk0/view?usp=sharing">Five Years On | Syria Crisis-related needs and vulnerabilities in Jordan</a>. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>While many of the cities and towns receiving refugees face similar challenges there is a significant difference. <strong>Some are transit locations, which asylum seekers pass on their way on to other destinations</strong>. <strong>They include major cities in Greece, Italy and Turkey, as well as small coastal towns </strong>from which people leave on boats to take their perilous journey across the sea. There, volunteers do their best to care for their immediate physical needs and the mandated administrative/security procedures to grant them entry onto the mainland.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other cities and towns \xa0are receiving the newcomers on a more long term basis.</strong> This happens <strong>in two different phases</strong>, each one posing its own \xa0political, administrative and infrastructural challenges for the hosting communities. The first one is the <strong>period of time between arrival and the approval or rejection of the person\u2019s application for refugee status</strong>. This period could be very long, as in the case of the Palestinian refugees in Jordan, or that of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/10/14/meet-the-eritrean-refugee-who-stands-for-everything-that-can-go-wrong-with-asylum-applications/">Mr. Teferi in Norway</a>. The second one is the <strong>period that begins once an individual has secured refugee status</strong>. In this period, the challenge is navigating the difficult period between receiving the papers and being fully established in the social and economic life of the host new community.</p>\n\n<p>While the details differ, the problems and needs mentioned by mayors, NGOs and activists fall into one or more of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Resource efficiency: How to get better at covering necessities of both refugees and citizens/ residents on very limited resources?</strong> As an example Jordan is one of the most water scarce countries in the world and 70 per cent of the population suffers from inadequate water supply below the national standard of 100 liters/person/day. Aging infrastructures, inefficiencies in operation and maintenance. interrupted provision of water services etc. <strong>Could resource scarcity be mitigated through Open Source technologies for recycling of sewage, seawater desalination at scale, deep drip irrigation etc?</strong> Affordable, modifiable technologies are required to manage the current crisis as well as <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/01/22/3191081/dangerous-climate-change-impact/">to secure peace in the region</a>.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Interoperability, knowledge transfer and Institutional memory:</strong> I heard many calls to \u201cmake information available about how the system works\u201d, and "calls for online platforms to fix a perceived\xa0lack of information" thought to be a "key obstacle for labor market access". Here too I head that \u201cwe need a database of all the initiatives and resources available to help refugees\u201d and "we need to make existing information about getting your paperwork done, how to set up a new business etc".\xa0<strong>There are</strong>\xa0<strong>three underlying assumptions</strong>: 1) That some people understand in detail \u201chow the system works\u201d as a whole and 2) That they can transmit that kind knowledge into brochures or documents and that 3) This information material will make the system navigable and penetrable for newcomers. These three assumptions do not hold up to scrutiny and could fill an entire blogpost with reasons as to why. For now I will simply refer you to the <a href="http://www.brickstarter.org/Brickstarter.pdf">Brickstarter report</a> as it is a light, beginner-friendly introduction to some of the issues.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Scalability of public services: How to build/rethink provision of public services so that they can accommodate changes in the number of people to serve? </strong>Many of the participants complained about the lack of resources to provide education or training for newcomers. Others mentioned the provision of health and social care services, especially psychological support for the traumatised. I heard a lot of calling for more resources to be put into existing services, but little examination of how existing services are performing and even less awareness about more effective, flexible and cost-efficient approaches. <strong>Are we sure that throwing money onto more of the same will result in better outcomes?</strong> \xa0Sugata Mitra\u2019s work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimally_invasive_education">Minimally Invasive Education</a>, Miguel Chavez\u2019s experienced from\xa0<a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7540-maker_spaces_in_favelas_-&lt;em&gt;lecture">building Makerspaces in Favelas</a>, <a href="http://berlin.freifunk.net/index&lt;/em&gt;en/">Freifunk</a> and many others offer alternative approaches with promising results. The political will, and practical ability, to welcome and accommodate newcomers depends on it. In this <a href="/en/opencare/welcome-to-opencare">recent talk</a>, I present a proposal for how we can break out of the zero-sum thinking in the provision of care services as an antidote to rising social tensions between social groups.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>One of the outcomes of the conference was that Mayors from Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Greece, Italy and Austria signed a <a href="http://now-conference.org/declaration/">declaration\xa0to work together</a> in solidarity across borders:</p>\n\n<p><img src="/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2308ee4564f49cfa274b2ed0ced598f046ad2ca1.jpg" width="666" height="500"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Politically, this is an important signal. However the event didn\u2019t get into the part I find the most interesting- <em>how</em> they expect to go from <em>intention</em> to <em>implementation</em>.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>So what is needed in order for this commitment to be delivered on?</strong> Based on discussions with mayors, activists and refugees it looks like the participants at NOW need:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Efficient and sustainable coordination across geographic, linguistic and technological barriers.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>A globe-spanning sustained effort to help community leaders, mayors, politicians and fight back against populist rhetoric and divisive narratives.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Ability to learn about and experiment with novel or unconventional approaches towards tackling root causes of problems which affect both newcomers and the host communities which welcome them.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>In practice this would require:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Active engagement of a lot of affected people in mapping and making sense of urgent problems related to a sudden influx of newcomers in education, housing, employment/entrepreneurship, language/social skills and finance</strong>. The reason being that those affected will only get behind efforts to solve problems if they trust the people involved, and have shared ownership in the process. Part of what builds trust is if people can recognise their own perspective, language and experiences in the description of the situation. That they are taken seriously as experts in their own lives- that their own <em>ambitions</em>, <em>words</em> and <em>thoughts</em> weigh at least as much as input of credentialed domain experts (who may never have set foot in the neighborhood). This was echoed by newcomers frustrated by discussions about training them to fit into pre-defined slots in society, based on what they perceived to be unfounded assumptions by institutional actors about what they could or could not achieve: <em>\u201cDo not put a cap on my dreams, just give me access to the tools and see what I can build with them\u201d.<em>\u200b</em></em>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Continuous mapping and connection of different private, public and third sector actors efforts into coherent shared plans</strong> that take into consideration the budgetary, logistical and political constraints within which each group is working. I can tell you from experience that is it not easy. The reason being that the incentives are aligned against it. We all agree that at the system level good documentation saves everyone time and resources. At the individual level it is more difficult to motivate the additional investment of time and effort. Where you see people doing this consistently is where it is a part of a shared culture and work ethos. To get this going you have to create the incentives for people to do additional work involved, instill the ethos, teach people the workflow and enforce it top down. Over and over. Until there is a critical mass doing it and others can share the effort of spreading and maintaining the enabling culture.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Take a minute to think about what this means.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>If the participants in the event want to see the transnational cooperation happen in practice, then they will have to learn to think and work as networks</strong> <strong>of individuals</strong> interacting inside, outside and all around different organisations. Each working at the hyperlocal, micro-level, while sharing and learning with others working in different contexts as a natural part of the everyday workflow\u2026 not just something afforded to people who can travel and spend 2 days talking with one another at a conference. And all of this done <strong>in</strong> <strong>ways that build granular, immediately relevant and continuously updated institutional memory accessible to all.</strong> Affecting behavioral change at this scale is hard, but it can be done.</p>\n\n<p>I think <strong>we can contribute in two ways.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. At LOTE5 we are organising this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/179569975738885/">reflexive design exercise on Collaborative inclusion: how migrants-residents collaboration can produce social values</a>.</strong> The event is run by Ezio Manzini, one the world\'s leading designers for social innovation.<strong> You can partner with us</strong>\xa0if you want to help make it into a workshop on addressing <em>specific </em>problems tied to reception and inclusion of asylum seekers. Or just sign up and participate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. We also have a way to produce cheap, accurate ethnographic data around problems like the ones mentioned above, with a focus on surfacing creative and actionable solutions</strong>. This would enable you to engage a large number of participants (thousands) in a participatory process for designing solutions to meet their own needs. This methodology is being employed/supported by a growing number of actors including the current Swedish minister of Nordic cooperation and strategic foresight, the European Commission, the Rockefeller Foundation, the United Nations Development Program and United Nations Volunteers as well as the cities of Milan and Matera in Italy, and of Bucharest in Romania. <strong>We have developed a methodological guide for doing this - </strong>email me if you would like a copy (cannot post online): nadia@edgeryders.eu.</p>', u'post_id': 5234, u'user_id': 8, u'timestamp': u'2016-01-27 23:40:09', u'title': u'After #NowConf | How can mayors, funders and activists collaborate to #unfail the "refugee crisis"?'}, {u'content': u'<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/1061c02ef026ffdeae6019515ada9037167f8817" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1061c02ef026ffdeae6019515ada9037167f8817.jpg" class="lightbox" title="noun_60748.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/1061c02ef026ffdeae6019515ada9037167f8817_1_500x500.jpg" width="500" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">noun_60748.jpg</span><span class="informations">1200x1200 5.65 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div><br><br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/1061c02ef026ffdeae6019515ada9037167f8817" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1061c02ef026ffdeae6019515ada9037167f8817.jpg" class="lightbox" title="noun_60748.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/1061c02ef026ffdeae6019515ada9037167f8817_1_500x500.jpg" width="500" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">noun_60748.jpg</span><span class="informations">1200x1200 5.65 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div><br><br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/1061c02ef026ffdeae6019515ada9037167f8817" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1061c02ef026ffdeae6019515ada9037167f8817.jpg" class="lightbox" title="noun_60748.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/1061c02ef026ffdeae6019515ada9037167f8817_1_500x500.jpg" width="500" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">noun_60748.jpg</span><span class="informations">1200x1200 5.65 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div><br></p>\n\n<p>As an incredibly diverse community, the range of experience and knowledge about building economically sustainability projects amongst members ranges from "where do I even begin" to "I just sold my 3rd company". Also, there are many different interpretations of "economic sustainability" and strategies for achieving it. <a href="/en/makerfox">Moneyless crowdfunding with Makerfox</a> anyone?</p>\n\n<p>A recurring topic is one David De Ugarte dove into in this <a href="http://goo.gl/02LvFP">Las Indias\'s piece</a> on generating revenue through sales. Especially in purpose/value driven contexts, this topic is often controversial and deeply unsettling: []\xa0<em>our \u201cconscience\u201d and the \u201cprivate logic\u201d will join forces to tell us \u201cwe are not good at it\u201d, and that this \u201cit\u201d \u2013 selling \u2013 is very close to deceiving. But this is false.</em>\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Most initiatives fail to generate monetary resources not because they don\u2019t manage to develop and deliver a product to the market; they fail because they develop and deliver an experience, service or product that no customers want or need enough to pay for. This is not magic though, it is something that you learn to do.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Many of the projects we see popping up on Edgeryders, are collaborative and decentralised initiatives. Perhaps it makes sense to structure a process which everyone can participate in to build economic sustainability into projects in a decentralised way:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<h3><span>Identify and document our assumptions</span></h3>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t\t<span>What are our assumptions/hypotheses about how we gratify our clients and or sponsors, who they are, how we will acquire and monetize them?</span><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t\t<span>What are our assumptions/hypotheses about how we serve the needs of our constituency, who they are, as well as how we engage them into becoming more active participants in (and beneficiaries of) our initiatives?</span><br>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p></p>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<h3><span>Talk to prospective customers to validate (or invalidate) our assumptions</span></h3>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t\t<span>What problems do they face? \xa0How do they solve them? \xa0What matters to them? \xa0What is a must-have for them?</span><br>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p></p>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<h3><span>Identify the risk factors in the opportunity</span></h3>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t\t<span>Are we facing significant technology risks? \xa0Or more of market risk? \xa0How can we test and validate these (starting with the most risky)? \xa0What market testable milestones can we build that would result in sufficient evidence to induce us to pivot or move forward?

I think the success of both depended on a few critical factors</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Clear, attractive offer.</strong> OpenAndChange: Save time ( 2.5 hours \xa0to participate in large funding bid instead of min. 1 month full time work). Alt33c3: Get benefits of a much loved, sold out, event through a parallel event situated in the same building instead of just being at home. Work in progress <a href="/en/the-reef/membership-models-and-prices">here</a>\xa0and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FBE4AzW8Ax21X5q6I8SL5XVJPHt6Cs9YkRy137hSH6E/edit">here</a>\xa0(you can see that we are not there yet if you look at the communication <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/161GNRarlnq3BiZQNp3OCtScWr130PxyUZigcpj-hyho/edit">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Clear process, low threshold to entry: </strong>OpenAndChange: Do these 5 steps with clear instructions (retweet once a day, fill in this simple form etc ). Alt33c3: contribute money in exchange for rewards (main one being the ticket to the event). Work in progress <a href="/node/6691">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Centralised coordination.</strong> You need a small core group that breaks down bigger challenges into small tasks, recruit people to do it, and organise onboarding events. We have done a lot of background work <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oCwb3iAGQDi7eeDeoQJG6NxmfoGvydfqUTvN9dNFDQI/edit?usp=drive_web">here</a>.

We call it <a href="/t/openvillage/788">OpenVillage Festival</a> and we want it to be a showcase of initiatives like yours. We envision it as a space to meet, present our projects to each other and wider communities (like-minded people, but also regular folks who could be your clients/funders in the future). On top of that, we will use it as an engine to crowdfund, learn how to fundraise and improve our work during hackathons with members of our community. That\u2019s a lot of great minds with plenty of knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We\u2019re looking for a place to host this!</strong> There\'s interest from Milano, Thessaloniki, Lile and other partnering cities and events. We will keep you posted. And maybe your city could help us make it happen? Ping us if so. </p>\n\n<p>Let us know if you want to be part of the village. What could you do to help us prepare and deliver a great experience, and what would you expect from it as an outcome?</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, we\u2019re dreaming of a more <strong>permanent space</strong> called <a href="/c/open-village/reef-brussels">The Reef Brussels</a>. Or, more precisely, even more than one space, where we will be putting our hands on building \u201creal life\u201d communities, altogether called "OpenVillage". It would be a house, a huge flat, a farm, or a former Olympic village which we can purchase collectively or lease for decades and use as a space for collaboration, experimentation and an engine of change. </p>\n\n<p>There is already a space in Brussels which might become the very first Reef (read more about it <a href="/t/6047">here</a>). And again, we want to ask if you\u2019d be interested in joining? What kind of contribution would you like to offer (in terms of time, skills, material, knowledge) and what kind of support would you expect from this space to generate for your work and life? Or do you know a space that would seem like an ideal destination for us?</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d be very grateful to hear from you about both, or any, of these calls. You can comment / add a new thread about The Reef <a href="/c/open-village">here</a>.

Counter Culture Labs was founded around 2011-2012 by a group of hackers with diverse backgrounds and interests. Members joined us from <a href="https://sudoroom.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Sudo Room</a>, another hacker space in Oakland, and <a href="http://biocurious.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Biocurious</a>, a biohacker space in Sunnyvale. Many were also involved in <a href="https://occupyoakland.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Occupy Oakland</a>, and wanted to establish a more permanent organization with the same community spirit and values. Eventually, the community we built in the hacker space reached a critical mass of knowledge and interest around the idea of starting to producing insulin with a manual protocol, but one designed to be simpler and less expensive than existing methods. We named the project \u201cOpen Insulin\u201d to reflect a commitment to make the results freely available to any interested party and publish our methods openly. The name was a deliberate reference to open source software.</p>\n\n<p>Open source, as many readers may know from the software world, is the practice of making all information necessary to produce and modify a product publicly available along with the product itself. It started in software as an alternative to the practice of providing only machine-readable copies of programs, which can\u2019t be understood or practically changed by users of the software. Without access to human-readable code, users and other stakeholders were shut out of their own tools. Open source methods of production are relevant not just to aligning incentives and improving the economics of software development, but also to scientific reproducibility and transparency, and in both software and science, open source can enable more participation and progress than trying to hold secrets close. In medicine in general, and diabetes treatments in particular, I think it holds one of the keys to breaking through the barrier between promising research and a stagnant market of treatments available to patients, just as it made software much more efficient to produce and use and enabled a great deal more innovation than was otherwise possible.</p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e56ebbaf00251fa5215a05d5a86937f780d62127.jpg" width="600" height="450"></p>\n\n<p>Open source software and the hacker culture that makes it was a major inspiration for biohackers to organize as such. \u201cBiohacker\u201d derives from the term \u201chacker\u201d in the sense used in the communities of early pioneers of computing, where it\u2019s a term used to refer to people who seek to understand how things work on the inside, instead of just using products as a consumer. Hackers are people who seek to modify things to serve their own purposes, instead of just accepting them as being limited to their originally intended purposes. It\u2019s an approach that emphasizes the philosophical concepts of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Phronesis" rel="nofollow noopener">phronesis</a> and <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Techne" rel="nofollow noopener">techne</a>, which describe an embodied, contextualized, practical approach to things, applied to science and technology. Biohackers are people who take a practical approach to understanding and engineering biological systems, and look beyond appearances and inside the black boxes of commercial products to understand the substance and true implications of things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If we can achieve the creation of open source insulin, it could contribute to at least three important goals </strong>- first, by making insulin production more economical at a smaller scale, and opening up manufacturing to much more competition, it could improve cost and access for patients. Second, we hope the protocol will serve as a basis for future research into improvements to insulin - variants that are longer acting, shorter acting, more temperature stable, and so on - that address different concerns that arise in treatment. Third, we hope it might serve as a basis for research and production of other proteins by small groups, and open up participation in research and development to accelerate progress in other aspects of diabetes treatment besides insulin and other areas of science and medicine besides diabetes treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Currently we\u2019re working on a novel method to produce human insulin, which is not patented, and as far as I know is not patentable. There are variations on normal human insulin to make them longer or shorter acting, which involve very small changes to the sequence that codes for human insulin.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/1e84d773ce67d449206df517f4a85e6bcaf9d51f" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1e84d773ce67d449206df517f4a85e6bcaf9d51f.jpg" class="lightbox" title="green fluorescence.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/1e84d773ce67d449206df517f4a85e6bcaf9d51f_1_690x386.jpg" width="690" height="386"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">green fluorescence.jpg</span><span class="informations">2500x1402 138 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>We\u2019ve been working in the lab for about 10 months, and we\u2019re just seeing the first signs of success on our first major milestone,</strong> the production of proinsulin, which is the precursor to insulin.

First, while we are a group of talented and curious folks, most of us are learning challenging lab protocols from scratch, and second, we\u2019re working with limited amounts of time and money, fitting the work into gaps in our schedules left by work or school, and mainly relying on surplus equipment and reagents that add delays and uncertainties to our work. So progress can be slow and involve a lot of detours on top of those implied by the already uncertain nature of scientific investigation, and we have to dig deep to figure out what to do next when something goes wrong. We do our best to learn fast, but it\u2019s difficult to follow up on everything we should with our limited time and resources and background knowledge. There\u2019s a lot of practical wisdom around making insulin that doesn\u2019t show up directly in the papers published in scientific journals, and we\u2019re learning these nuances of making things work as we go. Much of the value we hope to provide to the community is documenting as much of this practical wisdom as we can, and perhaps eventually automating the kind of work we\u2019re doing by hand right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If all goes well, we hope our techniques will be available to people with diabetes, especially to help meet the needs of people in resource-poor and lower-income countries.</strong> However, it\u2019s hard to say at this point when we might be able to deliver a result useful for making a pharmaceutical-grade product. After the scientific work, which might take a few years, there will be the work of seeking business partnerships and going through more engineering work and the biosimilar approval process in the US. In other areas of the world, it may be simpler, but might also involve more unusual local political considerations. We\u2019re hoping that our work will inspire others to move in parallel alongside us and increase the chances that one group will succeed quickly, and there are some preliminary signs that this is happening, which could yield results sooner. But there\u2019s no doubt we\u2019re at the start of a very long and winding road.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve had the good fortune to have many experts in relevant fields reach out to advise us to smooth out our path, but many important questions remain, and the most important ones remain for us to find new answers. Scientists who are reading this \u2013 can we count on you to contribute your expertise in protein expression and purification? Organizers \u2013 can you share with us your vision for expanding these efforts into a movement with participation from parallel groups like ours around the world?</p>\n\n<p><i>The production of this article was supported by</i><i>\xa0</i><a href="/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296"><i>Op3n Fellowships</i></a><i><b>\xa0</b></i><i>- an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.</i></p>\n\n<p><a href="/t/openvillage/788"></a></p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/a/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284.png" class="lightbox" title="banner_0.png"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/a/ad08bad218fe3b37bf9f66ec63da8536160ba284_1_690x85.png" width="690" height="85"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">banner_0.png</span><span class="informations">728x90 28.5 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p></p>', u'post_id': 552, u'user_id': 3370, u'timestamp': u'2016-11-09 08:57:58', u'title': u'How Open Insulin works to open-source science and medicine'}, {u'content': u"<p>Since summer 2009, 30 families started living together in the first \u201cofficial\u201d co-housing in a periferic neighborhood in Milan, and probably of whole Italy. To my knowledge, the phenomenon has been often recorded by the Media (radio, tv, magazines and newspapers) and Polytechnic of Milan (Ph.D. and Master dissertations) as a first and original case. For some months and years, people liked to come and visit, check, make interviews about an experience that, in those years, sounded strongly innovative and now is consolidated. Some other co-living \u201cresidences\u201d (but not many) of this kind have been promoted and started in the north of Italy and not only in Milan.</p>\n\n<p>What made this so new? Italy has a long story of small communities, both in the countryside (above all in the agricultural areas) and in urban areas. And we were about 70 people who didn't know each other before, who didn't share any identity or common belonging and who decided that co-housing could be a very good way to live. We have a shared living with semi professional kitchen, a small garden in the center of the building, shared laundry, bike space and hobbies area, and a terrace with swimming pool.</p>\n\n<p>It took almost two years (2007-2009) of co-creation and creating bonds between the members. Meanwhile, we've projected (thanks also to facilitators' support) some of the physical aspects of the building which allowed \u201cpersonalization\u201d by the community and facilitated the\xa0envisioning of a\xa0\u201cway of living\u201d. We agreed on some basic rules, attitudes, priorities and so on. Co-housing is about these two elements: the physical (spaces, objects, homes and shared areas) and relationships.</p>\n\n<p>Where are we about 7 years later?</p>\n\n<p>100 meetings +</p>\n\n<p>countless B-Day parties and shared lunches and dinners, bbqs</p>\n\n<p>4 kids +</p>\n\n<p>3 cats +</p>\n\n<p>the building is fixed</p>\n\n<p>rules of living have been adjusted through the real life experience</p>\n\n<p>group email and WhatsApp group still alive and working properly (communication is deep and useful to keep connection and support)</p>\n\n<p>micro-welfare and mutual support include a lot of different situations (child care / homework/ vacations, home trouble fixing, information, shopping for the neighbor, shared purchases, savings, medical support, emergency support, skills sharing\u2026)</p>\n\n<p>still volunteering in groups (garden caring, swimming pool fixing, legal affairs, food purchase)</p>\n\n<p>few people moved away but rented the house (just in case they come back)</p>\n\n<p>an association created to manage share expenses and service and to deal with town council and other local associations</p>\n\n<p>sharing knowledge and experiences (cooking course, dancing school, movies calendar, book presentations, pics competition/games, summer kids caring..)</p>\n\n<p>opening up to local events, well known in the neighborhood, networking with local associations</p>\n\n<p>Many aspects should be analyzed for a precise assessment, some are probably specific to this very situation, some can be generalized. Of course only general considerations should be done, a detailed story would be more interesting as we have passed through several phases which coincided with the local and historical events (for example, the economic crises affected some of the member families; the city of Milan has been evolving; the arrival of new members - children; the Expo 2015 in Milan hosted nearby us\u2026). But that would be very long.</p>\n\n<p>What I'd like to focus on instead is the startup, the real \u201clifestyle storming\u201d, the community forming, the association phase, the community's opening up to the local area, the maturation phase, and the What\u2019s Next?...</p>\n\n<p>I can\u2019t say everything we've done was perfect but surely many lessons have been taken. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>The \u201clight community\u201d has grown and changed adapted. At the beginning, we met very often to decide on things. We've probably put too \xa0much relevance in fulfilling the physical needs, while we should have been looking for ways in which we can balance different speeds for those who \xa0wanted to live this experience and adjust the levels of engagement\u2026 The preparation phase (2007-2009) \xa0could not \u201cprepare us\u201d for the real thing.</p>\n\n<p>The big point is the continuous discussion among people (meeting, email, \u201cworking\u201d groups) which is the backbone of this lifestyle, but also takes time and energy. We did probably too much of it at the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Many difficulties have been fought together as we've been creating a big space, with many problems to be fixed (electricity, legal, walls, gardens, technological infrastructure..). The social project was on top of that. None of us was particularly aware of good planning.</p>\n\n<p>The kids have been a strong \u201cglue\u201d among the family with kids and others, who became kind of uncles, grandpas or grandmas. And a topic of discussion for the other ones.</p>\n\n<p>We had to come by with a legal framework to a situation unknown by Italian law (we had to govern it in the traditional way). The paid professional legal \u201cadministrator\u201d has changed three times\u2026 It is hard for them to deal with a real counterpart with proposals and ideas for innovation.</p>\n\n<p>The usage of shared spaces, or of the mailing list, have changed through the time as we understood our needs in by practice.</p>\n\n<p>The opening up phase is probably one of the most interesting, as we tried to have our living room used by visitors. We have also created an association to manage the shared expenses (like a food purchase group, eventually a car), but also to prepare a project for the small park in front of home together with other associations.</p>\n\n<p>This was exactly the kind of situation that sociological literature likes to call a \u201cgated community\u201d . bu we never felt like that. \xa0we started as a non-group, we have become a light community with different sensibilities and priorities, we've engaged with the neighborhood in several ways, we took part in local decision making, social action, and so on\u2026</p>\n\n<p>It is still difficult to take care of a community when everybody has its own life and duties, and probably some external help and supervision would have helped in moderating tension, in identifying new solutions... Goodwill is never enough.</p>\n\n<p>We'd also gladly make use of a practical tool, perhaps a platform, to share materials, ideas, needs, etc. And being part of a bigger network to compare notes, support each other, share more, and maybe be connected with the town council infrastructure (cars, electricity, water, events, \u2026)</p>\n\n<p>Anyhow, both visitor and inhabitants of the place are still surprised by the aesthetic, the connection, the quality of living which is hugely superior to any normal flat experience in a city (and even in countryside) they experience here. And we are frequently asked if any apartment is on sale or for rent.</p>", u'post_id': 743, u'user_id': 116, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-15 09:04:29', u'title': u'Co-living in Milan'}, {u'content': u'<p>When discussing society\u2019s biggest questions I like to have a discussion with Ginette Bauwens, a figure of the activist scene in Brussels and well-spoken about any subject. She has the looks of a friendly grandmother but the vivacity and energy of a young activist that believes in the power of humans. She played an active role in the recent car free shift of the centre of Brussels but made sure it didn\u2019t become a gentrified zone. She majored in philosophy and made the choice to work all her live half time so she could invest her time in local or global movements.</p>\n\n<p>First when I asked her to give a short opinion about the bottom up imitatives organizing care related projects she responded: I only believe people can give care when it comes from love and friendship. All other forms need to be done by the government to be effective. I was really surprised by this ballsy argument so I invited over for a drink on the hottest day of the year (35\xb0C!) and we had a tomato juice and a great conversation.</p>\n\n<p>We dived immediately into the subject. Care is a government issue for\xa0 her that isn\u2019t at all taken care (pun intended) of. Why does the government give as much power to the pharmaceutical industry for example? Why can Nestl\xe9 become the number one partner of a government organization called \u2018Kind En Gezin\u2019 that helps parents of new-born through the first year? For her our role as activist and change makers is to put pressure on the government to make change on a big scale possible.</p>\n\n<p>I explain her how local initiatives are bending the system like <a href="/t/open-insulin/490">the open insulin</a>, <a href="/t/the-cytostatics-network-seen-through-the-eyes-of-a-member/484">chemotherapy in Romania</a> or ways that people are <a href="/t/doctor-could-you-hack-me-a-neuroprosthesis-please/483">hacking neuroprosthetis</a>. Even if she find them great initiative she is scared that it will not be scalable, for her if the government doesn\u2019t follow, nothing will change on the long term. I ask her why even within this idea people are rather trying to find solutions themselves then going in the street and pressuring the government. It makes sense, she says, you have an illusion doing something more meaningful while starting a project, then putting pressure on a government where the reward will (maybe) be given after many years. Instant gratification is much more popular, and with bureaucratic complexification people are less temped to get into a long battle with the government.</p>\n\n<p>But Ginette isn\u2019t the person to only be sceptic and give critic towards ideas. She likes finding solutions. So before I explain her the principle of the workshop we talk a bit further on the big problems ahead. For her everything can be put into three categories: poverty, elderly care and work ethics. Poverty makes it impossible to take care of each other; it is a vicious circle that is difficult to get out of. Even with the best projects, people without money will not get towards it. Elderly care is also a big problem in European countries, care became profit and it is all about efficiency. Only a rearrangement about how we look at elderly care can get us out of this problem. Finally there is the way we look at work and how it makes us sick: burn out is one of the biggest epidemics of this century and involves pulls the whole family downwards. Not one political party is discussing these problems on a larger scale and that is problematic for her. The resources are there, but the unwillingness of changing is bigger. Politicians aren\u2019t trained to be vectors of change; they are the ones that bring continuity. It\u2019s the civilians that need to push the change and politics to implement it.</p>\n\n<p>Dark times ahead? Maybe, but this discussion made me think more clearly about the workshop and what we need to take notice of when bringing care-project together. Like within the makers movement it is important to find a balance between corporate and counter culture partners, within care it is also important to have an open approach towards policy makers. Yes we are in a ruff path at the moment, and trust is at an all time low towards politicians. But therefor it is the moment to open our arms to welcome them towards new ways of organizing care. We need much more and easier collaboration between projects. We need especially that knowledge of the government to tackle complex problems with multiple partners. We need to take them by the hand and show them what there is possible within an open care system</p>\n\n<p>The discussion I want to open towards the community is: Is involving the policy makers important, or will it be obsolete in the future? What kind of dialogue can care taking projects take towards it?</p>', u'post_id': 726, u'user_id': 3293, u'timestamp': u'2016-08-26 13:32:05', u'title': u'Little Side note: What is the role of the Government in this Bottom-up Open Care project?'}, {u'content': u'<p>The second project started in the Himalayas in Nepal but now has spread to six other countries in developing world. Himalayan Cataract Project is a brain child of Dr. Sanduk Ruit, a Nepalese eye surgeon, who invented a cheap and simple method to operate cataract and restore vision. The organization was later on started by Dr. Tabin, American eye specialist who fell in love with the project while on holidays in Himalaya. The duo is now leading the world\u2019s biggest project aiming at removing cataract for the poorest:\xa0through\xa0a ten minute microsurgery with\xa0articial lens\xa0implantation.</p>\n\n<p>The project is extraordinary and has been documented in media all over the world.

Of course they are facing a lot of problems and some are probably more serious tha the one we are trying to solve. We found out that -waiting for german bureaucracy to give them the needed papers and learning german- a lot of them feel lost in their new environment. Although our focus is on refugees Newcomer is for everyone, who is new in the city.</p>\n\n<p>Our App combines different types of challenges in a city-rally taking place in Berlin. They make them explore the town and talk to people. So for exapmple it asks them to take a photo of something, that reminds them of their origin. Also we are inviting Institutions like Bars, Caf\xe9s and Eventspaces be a part of our project. So for example we lead a participant to a caf\xe9 and ask him to drink a coffee with someone. Both drinks are half priced so they get in contact by using this discound. With a growing community different app-users could match and meet to solve tasks together and have a nice experience.</p>\n\n<p>So our app definitely is no tourist guide.

They would be innovative, fairly priced and an integral part of their local community. They would be great places to work, and run for the benefit of all, not to maximize profit or subject to the whims of governments. That\u2019s our dream.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>A bit of background: The care industry in the UK is in crisis (the BBC recently called it the problem no one can fix). \xa0It is a familiar story.\xa0 The <span>demand</span> for care is growing rapidly due mainly to an ageing population, with increasingly complex conditions, a breaking down of traditional community-provided care, and higher expectations amongst the elderly.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the <span>ability</span> of government-funded institutions to meet those needs is diminishing. They lack the resources, the responsiveness and the political will to deal with the population\u2019s increasingly complex care needs.</p>\n\n<p>At the same, escalating asset prices are putting pressure on traditional providers, and attracting hedge funds and private equity looking for the "growth opportunities\u201d. \xa0The result is that many care home are being run as a businesses more than as a service, meaning that profit and shareholder value is prioritised over the needs and well-being of residents or staff.</p>\n\n<p>Caring for Life is a diverse team has come together to seek a better solution. We are inspired by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>open source communities, that harness collective intelligence to find new solutions to old problems;</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>networked organisations, notably Buurtzorg, the community care provider in the Netherlands, that combine the benefits of being small with the benefits of being part of something large.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>traditional community-based approaches to care-giving that are human-centred and sustainable.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>We intend to will achieve this in particular by taking over existing care home businesses and creating, one-by-one, a network of homes modelling the type of care we want to see. \xa0Once we have established a small number of our own homes, we will reach out to other like-minded operators to create a broader community of homes around the UK.</p>\n\n<p>A key operating principle will be to involve all "stakeholders".\xa0 Buurtzorg (mentioned above) has an excellent model, illustrating the various levels of involvement, and whilst this is primarily looking at <strong>home care</strong> as opposed to <strong>care homes</strong>, it is a useful way of viewing the bigger picture.</p>\n\n<p>Care home residents come into care with social networks, habits, routines and pastimes, which are normally stripped away on entering care. As far as possible these should be maintained because these are part of the person\'s "support system". Involving the family and friends as well as the wider community will, whilst it may add to the complexity, lighten the burden of care and increase quality of life for all affected.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Legal structure:</strong>\xa0 Our intention is to separate out the capital assets from the business of caring. The precise legal structure remains to be worked out but may be similar to a so-called community land trust (see <a href="http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/what-is-a-clt/about-clts"></a><a href="http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/what-is-a-clt/about-clts">http://www.communitylandtrusts.org.uk/what-is-a-clt/about-clts</a>) where one organisation (maybe a charity) owns the freehold of the land and a social enterprise runs the care home. \xa0There would be some element of employee ownership, which has been shown in many businesses to encourage higher than average levels of productivity and profitability.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Getting started:\xa0 </strong>Our intent is to start by acquiring control of one care home.\xa0 In order to keep capital needs as low as possible in the early stages, the intention is to lease premises on a long-term lease rather than buying a home. An opportunity has been identified near the south coast of England and conversations have started with the owners.\xa0 This is an interesting opportunity, in particular because there is an chance to acquire the property and business for a low price.\xa0 The home is currently subject to "special measures\u201d, imposed by the Care Quality Commission.</p>', u'post_id': 758, u'user_id': 104, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-20 15:57:34', u'title': u'Caring for Life - a dream of fixing the care home crisis in the UK'}, {u'content': u'<p>We\'ve considered organizing our Pop-Up Village within an existing event this year (we as Nadia, Noemi, me).

But, a technology that enables blind and vision impaired to mediate their perception of their environment and interact with their surroundings is actually empowering then to be independent from aid devices.</p>\n\n<p>Many blind and partially sighted people of all ages are unable to lead independent lives because they are not getting the support they need. The needs of people who lose their sight are many and varied and the support provided must be personalized if it is to meet individual needs. Teaching the blind to see with hearing using echolocation would be a way to make the largest impact, beyond the use of sight. \xa0The benefits of acquiring this skill changes the way you interact with your surroundings on a daily basis. It decreases limitations and opens the door to new opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>The Journey begins</p>\n\n<p>Irene Lanza, Management Engineer, CEO of SoundSight Training, knows it\u2019s possible. Irene came in contact with the Scimpulse Foundation while participating in the Challenge Based Innovation program of Ides2quare at CERN in Geneva. The challenge was to design something that enabled blind people to perceive the surrounding environment. It was then the idea was planted. \xa0Many opted for a mobile device approach, something else called the attention of Irene. Teaching the blind to echolocate themselves?</p>\n\n<p>Through this experience, Irene had the opportunity to interact with the visually impaired. Through working with mothers of blind children and getting to hear their stories, setbacks and concerns the more Irene wanted to do something to support and empower them. Guidance of blind and visually impaired people is a clear unmet need. However, most blind and visually impaired people want to go out and enjoy independent mobility.</p>\n\n<p>The environment in which we live is becoming increasingly complex. Even a journey across a city \xa0requires a range of skills including being able to avoid obstacles on the pavement, to walk in the right direction, play a sport and the list goes on. These tasks may seem trivial, but for someone with a vision impairment, this is a challenge and a skill that needs to be learned. SoundSight enables the development of a hearing talent that compensates for the missing eyesight.</p>\n\n<p>See With Sound</p>\n\n<p>SoundSight Training was developed to enable the blind to see with sound. Together, with Henrik Kjeldsen and Dr. Marco Manca the first prototype of an echolocation training system, was created.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s a virtual reality environment based on audio. The training is completed with practice in the real world until the student becomes fully independent from the simulation. Further explanation of how can be found here. SoundSight attracted the attention of the Italian government and a number of organisations and advocates that offered its support. \xa0Among them were, Cecilia Camellini, Champion Paralympic Swimmer. When asked what she thought of SoundSight, \u201cwith training and effort athletes can improve performance.\u201d \xa0</p>\n\n<p>Experience the world more independently</p>\n\n<p>SoundSight Training is a spinoff of the Let Me See Project, the first from the ScimPulse Foundation \xa0I.M.mortal research program. It was a 3 year journey that started from a workshop and now partners with governmental organizations to impulse the idea forward beyond the prototype stage. Now it has its own heartbeat. SoundSight Training designed to helping people explore the world more independently.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis software has the potential to enrich the lives of people who are blind and visually impaired. Everyone can learn this skill, it\u2019s accessible to everyone and when we design for greater accessibility, everyone benefits.\u201d says Irene Lanza. \xa0\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Improving performance, challenging yourself, to overcome limitations, all of this effects humanity\u2019s growth, expansion and well-being.

I went to a rural all boys National School and was in a small class of 8 boys. My memories of that time are mostly of playing lots of sports and having the craic (Irish word for fun) with my fellow students. There was no bullying whatsoever, indeed bullying was something I didn\u2019t know existed until I went to secondary school. This period in my life was the classic definition of Childhood Innocence.</p>\n\n<p>From my first year in secondary school I was quite successful academically. Even though I was quite happy at school I found the weekends and holidays from school difficult. I would never see my classmates at the weekends or at Christmas, Easter or summer holidays. This was the start of the first time I ever felt feelings of depression. It was before the time of email, or mobile phones or social media. These times were times of complete and utter isolation from my friends. In these dismal days I used to study hard, write melancholic poetry and just postpone my happiness to when I would be finished my Leaving Cert (Irish exams) and be able to escape to a distant University. I did feel the presence of Hope. I felt I could suffer and suffer during those teenage years and that things would be better when I moved on to University. Where did my hope stem from? I was very academic and had dreams of becoming a mathematician or a poet or a political activist. I fantasised about being as prolific and brilliant as Yeats or Da Vinci.</p>\n\n<p>When I was awarded a place in Engineering in Trinity I moved to Dublin. I was unhappy with my Engineering course and after a few weeks stopped attending and instead just led a party life, drinking for the first time. I started to feel very isolated and depressed but I didn\u2019t tell my family or friends the true extent of my feelings.</p>\n\n<p>I recall writing very black poetry at this time and feeling a strong sense of failure.\xa0 At that end of term I formally withdrew from the Engineering course and returned to home in Galway.</p>\n\n<p>While I was in Dublin I met Deirdre who was studying the same course as me. From the first meeting we hit it off and developed a very strong platonic relationship. Even though we both would end up being diagnosed with the same bipolar label Deirdre and I never discussed mental health issues. We would go to pubs and gigs together and discuss music, poetry, philosophy and other topics. When I moved back to Galway we corresponded by snail mail, sending each other long handwritten letters and photocopies of poems and inspiring song lyrics. While we didn\u2019t discuss depression or medication Deirdre and I both were able to express to each other how black our lives could feel. I guess you could say we held Hope for each other.</p>\n\n<p>That Christmas my health deteriorated and I acquired glandular fever. After a short hospital stay I returned home to suffer months of crippling fatigue. I have battled with severe fatigue ever since.\xa0 I was ill for most of that year and was idle until I won a place in Information Technology in the University in Galway. Even though I was living at home I was very happy to attend this course. I found this University more relaxed and got on very well with my classmates. For some reason I suffered a breakdown during my final term of my degree. I didn\u2019t tell friends or family but had meetings with some of the lecturers to see could I postpone my final exams.</p>\n\n<p>I found my mind was racing and I felt I needed very little sleep. I also used alcohol to help me relax and unwind from the racing thoughts. Since my father was Bipolar my parents recognised these symptoms and persuaded me to see a G.P. to deal with them. After a short meeting with my family G.P. he recognised the classic symptoms of mania and set up an appointment to see a psychiatrist. That psychiatrist whom I saw for 13 years admitted me to hospital.</p>\n\n<p>I suffer from Bipolar 1, meaning I suffer very high highs or mania, and very suicidal lows. When I get my highs medication seems to have very little effect on me. Instead it is a case of spending months in the safe confines of a hospital until the mania subsides. When I have my lows I get very suicidal and on two separate admissions for depression I have had to resort to Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) to treat my severe depression. There is quite a lot of controversy over ECT. I believe that it is a useful treatment of last resort. When a patient is in hospital and has been suicidal and catatonic with depression for many weeks with various medications being tried to no avail then I think ECT should be considered.</p>\n\n<p>In the past 14 years since my first hospital admission I have had perhaps 4 or 5 admissions for mania and 2 or 3 for depression. Thankfully I have managed to avoid admission to hospital for the past 6 years except for six nights in summer last year.</p>\n\n<p>Many of us have lost loved ones to suicide. The loss is devastating. I lost my father and my friend Deirdre to suicide. My father had been diagnosed with Bipolar and suffered from the condition from middle-age. Looking back I can see the times he was manic or high, singing loudly on the half hour drive to school where he taught every day. I vividly remember during my teenage years his first admission to psychiatric hospital my Dad weeping with happiness when he was released home on leave for a few days at Christmas.</p>\n\n<p>Dad snapped one day in school and that was the end of his teaching career. From that point on he had two overdose attempts. He had gone undiagnosed for the physical illness Haemochromatosis for many years and this aggravated his severe arthritis. My father was in severe pain. Unfortunately his Consultant gave him the news that his arthritis was so severe that he wouldn\u2019t be able to have necessary hip or knee replacements. From that point on my father lost all hope and was just biding his time, waiting for an opportunity to carry out his plans. The last time my father left psychiatric hospital for leave before his suicide he had a conversation with his physiatrist with our family present. The psychiatrist was trying to ascertain the risk of self-harm for my father when on home leave. My father said he wouldn\u2019t try an overdose again, not saying he wouldn\u2019t try another method. The psychiatrist said \u201cMaybe it will be third time lucky Liam!\u201d That statement for me sums up how detached some medical professionals can be, maybe it is how they protect themselves. After my father\u2019s suicide things are a blur. It was as if all the happy memories were pulverized. Childhood milestones, holidays, special occasions all faded away. My only remaining image of my father is him with a pained ashen face, his eyes saying I can\u2019t go on. You try to recall happy memories but all you can focus on is the finality of what happened.</p>\n\n<p>When you are feeling bad it is not too difficult to let someone else know this, however when you have lost all hope and a torrent of negative thoughts is leading you to actively plan your demise then the real insidious nature of suicide rears its head and the last thing you will consider doing is letting someone know just how lost you feel.</p>\n\n<p>My friend Deirdre was very successful academically but struggled feeling the engineering course she was doing was cold and soulless. In correspondence back and over we discussed how banal many of the subjects were and did she really want to end up as an engineer instead of something with more soul like a musician or writer. Deirdre took a year out in 3rd year and worked with IBM. She did well with IBM and returned to Trinity to finish her engineering course and did very well graduating with a first class honours degree. After graduating Deirdre and I didn\u2019t stay in contact as much. A bit like my father I remember seeing her visit me when I was in the intensive unit in a psychiatric hospital in Dublin. I could tell she found it very hard to see me so unwell and I felt she must have wondered was there a risk of her becoming so unwell. Even though Deirdre had seen me in hospital she still never would discuss with me her own mental health or her hopes or fears. After many months of being out of contact with Deirdre I tried to get in touch with her. There was no reply to her phone or email address. Thinking she might have changed jobs I did an internet search for her name. To my horror I came across a Memorial website to Deirdre. Phoning her parents they confirmed the tragic news. Her father told me the story of Deirdre\u2019s last days. Deirdre has been suffering low mood and nothing anybody could do seemed to help. Worried for her safely her parents asked her to come home to Wexford to visit them, otherwise they would have to insist on visiting her in Dublin. That weekend they did everything to try to lift her mood, visiting family and friends and going to shops and restaurants. However Deirdre went back to Dublin. That Monday her mother phoned her at lunch time. Deirdre said she was going to lunch with work colleagues. However the truth was Deirdre had taken a huge overdose of medication that morning, months\u2019 worth of medication she has stopped taking. When her boyfriend returned home that evening Deirdre was dead. You can\u2019t do an autopsy into someone\u2019s state of mind. Deidre had a great job, a steady boyfriend and had just bought a new apartment.</p>\n\n<p>Since my teenage years I have had swings from wildly optimistic grandiose hopes to rock bottom loss of all vestiges of hope. Suicidal ideation can prosper in the absence of hope. Luckily during many of the extreme lows I just try and go into hibernation mode, having a strong belief that if I just get through the oncoming weeks and months then things will have to improve.</p>\n\n<p>On one occasion for some reason I lost this faith in the future. This wasn\u2019t any kind of impulsive plan or drunken depression. Instead I gradually began to see the future without me as a part of it. I got rid of all my books, got rid of all my CDs and records. I closed bank accounts, I cancelled mailing lists. I booked an appointment with Free Legal Aid with the intention of creating a will.</p>\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t want to cause trouble so my plans revolved around how I could plan my demise with the minimum of pain or distress for my family and friends. I didn\u2019t want my family to have to discover me or call emergency services. So, as I thought, logically, I should get into a body-bag beside the morgue in the hospital. I would be discovered by somebody used to dealing with corpses and it would be a short move into the morgue.</p>\n\n<p>I find it hard to think back and know how I escaped from these suicidal plans. There is somehow Hope to be found at rock bottom depths of depression. From that lowest point I resolved to get well and stay well and to throw everything at the problem. I took personal responsibility for my mental health difficulties. Instead of just relying on medication to work on its own I added other tools to the mix. I did a long course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. This helped with the crippling anxiety and negative thoughts I suffered from. I began to get a lot more exercise into my life. I walk my dog every day and go to the gym regularly. I did the Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) course a few times until it became a regular part of my life and a great tool to help me every day. Supports are very important. I have always had great support from my family and friends. However it can sometimes be very difficult to discuss some of these topics with family and friends and I worry about burning them out by talking about the same old issues over and over. This is why I joined a mutual support mental health group called GROW.</p>\n\n<p>I joined GROW in April 2013. My Cognitive Behavior Therapy nurse had recommended it and felt the structured approach to problem-solving would suit me. I have been a very regular attendee at meetings and have led the meetings a number of times. I also enjoyed attending the weekly coffee meetings and the regional conference. In GROW we believe in providing leadership by taking on even small responsibilities. I have a strong interest in Cinema so I took up the responsibility of organising a weekly cinema outing for GROW members. This was a great success and GROW members from all around the country were able to meet up to enjoy a regular night out. I was thrilled to be asked to present a leadership paper at the National Conference during my first year with GROW. My confidence in my abilities has increased and I gladly took on the role of Group Recorder when the position arose. Because of GROW I gained enough confidence to apply for a volunteering position with Age Action to teach IT to the over 55s.</p>\n\n<p>I was the facilitator of my weekly GROW group for over two years and we hold Hope for each other. Last year I took up the opportunity of attending a creative writing class freely given by Galway writer Rita Ann Higgins primarily for GROW members. Our members got the chance to have their poems and short stories published in a booklet and I enjoyed reciting two of my poems at the GROW National Conference in Galway. During the past few years I have also been involved with Advancing Recovery in Ireland (ARI). Service users like myself have been working with HSE staff, and we have been planning the introduction of Recovery Colleges, Peer Support worker positions and Consumer Panels.</p>\n\n<p>Soon after my initial diagnosis my psychiatrist encouraged me to get involved in mental health advocacy work. It would be 15 years later before I did this and found the benefits of it. Last year I completed 12 weeks of training with 4 hours per week work with the Irish Advocacy Network. I am now in the early stages of serving on one of these Consumer Panels as secretary, representing the views of service users in the Galway mental health area.</p>\n\n<p>I am a co-founder of Cos\xe1in. A wellness centre based in the city. Cos\xe1in supports people with mental health challenges in identifying and pursuing their own pathways to recovery. Cos\xe1in is peer led by people with their own experience of mental health challenges and recovery. We work in groups offering:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Recovery education</p></li>\n<li><p>Recovery through creativity</p></li>\n<li><p>Peer support</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This month I completed 7 days of training to be a WRAP facilitator. WRAP is a symptom monitoring, crisis planning and self-help mental health recovery programme. It was first developed by Mary Ellen Copeland in the States and was further developed by a group of people who experience mental health difficulties.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to close by reflecting on an element of Recovery we define in GROW. The road to recovery is not always a smooth journey, even lately I have had very anxious thoughts which threaten to cause me to avoid or abandon enjoyable events I had planned to attend. However in GROW we say although \u201cold irrational feelings may return from time to time\u201d in Recovery \u201cthey do not change your thinking or behavior\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>To paraphrase Mary Ellen Copeland I feel that I have gotten well, I can stay well and I have confidence that I can go on to meet my life dreams and goals. I have Hope.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>', u'post_id': 562, u'user_id': 3528, u'timestamp': u'2017-01-10 19:26:54', u'title': u'Losing Hope & Gaining Hope'}, {u'content': u'<p><strong>Povestea mea cu Edgeryders e simpla</strong>.

It was organized <a href="http://www.c-minegenk.be/nl/onderneem-op-c-mine/5-voor-13/wedstrijd" rel="nofollow noopener">C-Mine Genk</a>, an innovation laboratory in the old coalmines of the Flemish region of Limburg. I got selected as one of the finalist for my solution for a solution for the intergenerational gab, commonly known as the kids that don\u2019t visit grandma anymore because she is to old\u2026</p>\n\n<p>For my solution I started by looking at the obvious part: intergenerational contact is good for the <a href="http://www.legacyproject.org/guides/intergenbenefits.html" rel="nofollow noopener">health of the elderly and also good for the development of the kids on multiple levels</a>. So what was missing is a tool that brought them together.</p>\n\n<p>I grew up in a rather unconventional setting for people of my generation and later (90s kids like the internet would say) My parents and i shared the house with an elderly woman that wasn\u2019t my grandmother but the godmother of my dad. She was rather cultivated woman with brought knowledge about geography, literature and history. She helped me out on my schoolwork and we shared our interest in reading the news. When she started having difficulties to move out of the house, I helped her staying young by introducing her to the then new technology called DVD and PS2. We played bowling on the Wii and if she would have stayed around longer, I\u2019m sure she would have used my tablet. In opposite to my grandmother who was visiting us every week, my \u2018m\xe9m\xe9\u2019 stayed young in her head, and i think it was patly thanks to our dayle exchanges. She would learn me about history and i would learn her about technology.</p>\n\n<p>So when designing my idea i took this story and tried to create the mechanisms that made it work and what was needed to scale up. I found that people where already implementing wii\u2019s in elderly homes to give them exercise. While this is a good idea for them to exercise, the intergenerational part was still missing. So how could we create a game where kids needed to come to the elderly without them having the feeling it was a burden?</p>\n\n<p>Well you know those games on your phone where you need to do repetitive tasks to go up levels to beat new monsters, like 99% of all mechanics of Role Playing Games? Why not extrude those mechanics of training to the elderly. Give them exercises they can do all day to gain skill points. Arm movements will help the Atk stat for example, Balance will help Def stat and so on. The twist is that the kids playing the game will need to go physically to the elderly to get their little guy leveed up. Want to beat a new boss, but you miss some skillpoint, well go to one of the elderly homes where they play the game and go talk with them. Maybe the first time the discussion will be pure mechanical, but when returning a bound will be created between the people and discussions will be about more then only the game. You have to see it as an incentive to bring people together.</p>\n\n<p>After presenting this project i finished third and got 500 euro\u2019s to spend on material for the project. At that time i was even less into the entrepreneurs world and i failed to continue this project.\xa0 I still think there are some logics and mechanisms that could be interested to work out. Anybody that is willing to use this is free to do anything with it, as long as he gives me a sign about it. It would be awesome to prototype it.</p>', u'post_id': 783, u'user_id': 3293, u'timestamp': u'2016-10-07 10:08:46', u'title': u'The healthgame that never was: using gamification to shorten the gap between generations'}, {u'content': u'<p>Dandelion "Pissenlit" roots for cure cacer, Yes it\'s possible and without fees!!</p>\n\n<p>\xa0There are many different types of cancer any people get killed by it.

The bad effect of this treatment is not his non efficiency but also killing the healthy cells, even if he kill the cancer cells inside body.!!! From this treatment there are some bad effect like, appetiteless, loss of weight, weakness of antibody, ...)\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Actually, 7 people here in Madagascar have been heal by this treatment when they heard about it, and follow the instructions. It\'s \xa0a close friend of mine who have been sick by "liver and intestine" cacer.

Doctors doesn\'t find any clue of cancer on him. Maybe the phase of his cacer was primary and it\'s was easy to cure. So my conscience is restless when I heard that there are many people who suffer, dead from cancer "it\'s like non assistance of people in danger". I decided to share it with you.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>-THIS IS THE YOU NEED TO FOLLOW.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>1# You need to collect dandelion on a place where cars doesn\'t barely ride.</p>\n\n<p>2# non chemical insecticides or related haven\'t been sprayed on the soil where you collect it.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>-PREPARATION\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Boil 1 liter of top water, when it\'s still boiling, ad 100 grams of \xa0dandelion roots. \xa0Leave it boiling \xa0for 10 minutes ( never more never less than 10mn.

This is your "drinking water for one day" the better moment for drinking much is before breakfast and dinner, also drinkable in middle time. Do it for 20 days and stop for 10 days. Keep do it again from the beginning as a cycle of one month (20 plus 10 days.)\xa0</p>\n\n<p>If everything has been followed step by step in one week, we can find the changes ; inside pain goes out, \xa0patient will find appetite, this is the major factor of this treatment and it\'s make a big different between it and chimiotherapy.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>If I understand and correct me if I\'m wrong!! chimiotherapy kills cancerous cells but also healthy cells. Patient get weak, lost appetite and doesn\'t have no much time for living, \xa0It\'s a kind of catalyst inside body.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>But this dandelion\'s \xa0roots hunt and kill all cancerous cells inside body. \xa0After you recognize that patient is completely cured, all we have to do is care about wound healing leave by the cancer inside the body. We can keep doing it by natural method using garlic. \xa0Take one glass of hot water, \xa0scratch 3 or 4 peaces of garlic and put it inside the glass of hot water. \xa0Leave it for one night and drink it before breakfast, \xa0keep do it until its gone, \xa0or you can still buy some medecines in drug store if you want to heal \xa0wound leaved by cancer.</p>\n\n<p>\xa0I hope that everyone can find a way to cure and fight cancer on his own natural or chimical.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions about this, any suggestions or critics please don\'t hesitate to write bellow\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Dear friends Edgeryders, I wish an Happy and successful new year to each every one of you.<img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 805, u'user_id': 3340, u'timestamp': u'2017-01-04 19:12:10', u'title': u'Natural method using against cancer'}, {u'content': u'<p>Fifteen years ago, I wrote an academic paper on the incipient technology of digital advertising screens, the way they were likely to change our experience of urban living and the challenges they posed to our conceptions of self, privacy and the public realm.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, such technologies were the stuff of science fiction movies \u2013 part of the classic \u2018Blade Runner\u2019 aesthetic of cosmopolitan dystopia. Most people did not anticipate their widespread adoption, and certainly did not consider their subtle social implications; but for those who did, perhaps the most haunting fear about their probable dissemination was the certainty that the social and psychological changes they engendered would quickly become the new status quo, unnoticed and unquestioned.</p>\n\n<p>Passing through Kobenhavn airport this morning, a digital advertising screen promoted this month\u2019s \u2018Presidents Summit\u2019 on the topic of \u2018<a href="http://avt.dk/en/events/presidents-summit-disruption/" rel="nofollow noopener">Disruption</a>\u2019: \u201cDisruption will change your job. Disruption will change your company. Disruption will change the world. Join our world leading summit and learn how to lead the change and make sure you are one of tomorrow\'s frontrunners.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That the idea of \u2018disruption\u2019 has moved from the radical edge of digital culture and post-2008 political insurgency to the topic of a plenary meeting of senior executives \u2013 featuring speeches by Apple\u2019s Steve Wozniak and arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage \u2013 shows the degree to which the concept has spread through society to become the \u2018new normal\u2019; a sign, perhaps, of just how much the pace of social, technological and economic change has increased since I fretted about the novel impact of moving images on the urban populace.</p>\n\n<p>But it also raises the question of how much of this disruption is merely cosmetic \u2013 or, rather, how much the very genuine disruption of ordinary lives only serves to bolster the established iniquities of our current economic and political status quo. If disruption is merely another business opportunity from the playbook of \u2018creative destruction\u2019 capitalism, if the elite response to it is simply to fight harder to be one of \u2018tomorrow\u2019s frontrunners\u2019 (while those who can\u2019t keep up must, presumably, be left behind), then perhaps this is merely another case of <em>plus \xe7a change, plus c\'est la m\xeame chose</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If so, what would genuine disruption look like? Is it possible that it might look like the opposite of all this? That it might look like a rejection of these kinds of disruption? The stories emerging from the OpenCare initiative suggest that this may be the case. Again and again, the tales that emerge are of a less hierarchical, more empowering approach to health and care; of individualised, human-scale responses to unique instances of wider social problems; of a movement away from the paradigm that measures \u2018efficiency\u2019 of care in terms of speed, throughput or numbers discharged \u2013 measured, in short, on how fast the system can cease to be in relationship with the citizens who have sought aid.</p>\n\n<p>True disruption, then, might not look like the world-spanning, high-octane revolutions beloved of the senior executives. It might look like slowness; like quietness; like a return to engagement at the scale of the human being. It might just turn out that old is the new new.</p>\n\n<p>My own involvement with OpenCare stems from a very particular form of healthcare, based on something very old, small and quiet \u2013 the Community Multibed Acupuncture Clinic (CMAC).</p>\n\n<p><a name="docs-internal-guid-6ddc05b4-e780-7761-4bce-3a38993987b6"></a> Community Acupuncture is a new version of an old format of providing a very old form of medicine \u2013 using traditional East Asian methods, it eschews the one-to-one treatments most common in the West, instead adapting the traditional Chinese model of treating multiple patients at once in the same room. This enables treatment to be offered more cheaply, as well as creating a shared space of communal healing, so that healthcare becomes a site of community empowerment. There are now over 170 such clinics in the US and more than 50 in the UK (you can read about their history and ethos on the websites of <a href="https://www.pocacoop.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">POCA</a> and <a href="http://acmac.net/acu/pro/" rel="nofollow noopener">ACMAC</a>).</p>\n\n<p>As I detailed in my original Opencare <a href="/t/community-acupuncture-an-ongoing-mutation/638">blog post</a>, I have been slowly evolving a CMAC of my own to serve a small and somewhat dysfunctional market town in the South-West of the UK. Through this process, a number of tough lessons and intriguing insights have emerged, with broader implications for the innovative provision of care in contemporary European societies.</p>\n\n<p>I subtitled my initial post \u201cAn Ongoing Mutation\u201d both in reference to the <a href="http://www.communichi.org/a-very-brief-history-of-community-acupuncture-in-america/" rel="nofollow noopener">overall development of the approach in the West</a> and to my own experience of developing a clinic. This experience has been one of trial and error, of creative response to practical and bureaucratic challenges, and of constant adaptation to feedback from \u2013 and through ongoing relationship with \u2013 the community; as I learn more about their needs and perspective, I have changed the way I am treating, the way I interact with patients, the hours treatment is offered and the venue it is offered in.</p>\n\n<p>To ask, as a state bureaucrat convinced of the usefulness of CMACs might, \u201chow can we replicate this so that we can roll it out across the country at an official level?\u201d rather misses the point; it is precisely by being embedded in the community that this process of creative mutation can occur, and precisely by meeting patients outside the usual structures of state-sanctioned medical authority that a more horizontal trust and respect can be created, and a more creative approach to healthcare provision enacted.</p>\n\n<p>Like many of the other projects featured in OpenCare, the flexibility of Community Acupuncture \u2013 light on infrastructure, expensive medical equipment or architectural requirements, reliant instead on the portable diagnostic and treatment skills of the practitioner \u2013 makes it well-suited to navigating a disrupted present and an uncertain future. Quite aside from its effectiveness at treating unexplained and chronic conditions (the kind mainstream Western medicine does not excel at curing), having the ability to treat without reliance on fragile, resource-intensive and environmentally-damaging industrial supply chains may well prove to be a great asset in the near future. Indeed, the worth of this is already being proven through the work of charitable foundations like <a href="http://www.worldmedicine.org.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener">World Medicine</a>, who have set up successful CMACs in poor, rural areas of India, Palestine, Nepal and Sri Lanka.</p>\n\n<p>Problems still remain, not least with the institutional resistance to acupuncture \u2013 often based on little more than ill-informed prejudice against \u2018alternative\u2019 medicine. There are clashes within the acupuncture community, as well, on <a href="http://liberationacupuncture.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">how best to treat</a>, and issues with providing quality-assurance and redress to patients whilst working outside the usual channels and institutions of healthcare.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the popularity and effectiveness of CMACs speak for themselves. All too often, the state-established institutions of care remain locked into a post-imperial perspective, treating the body, the patient or the polis as the passive subject of a homogenised, top-down intervention.</p>\n\n<p>It is a little like a digital advertising screen, broadcasting a single, one-way message to a public who have no choice but to receive it. Just like a digital advertising screen, this kind of healthcare can seem cutting-edge, innovative and technologically impressive, but its values do not respect the uniqueness of individual or place, nor do they promote communal solidarity and empowerment. So long as this is the case, communities will continue to vote with their feet, seeking out new forms of adaptive Open Care that address their real mental, physical and social needs.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I would love to see Community Acupuncture being integrated with some of the other projects and approaches detailed in OpenCare; to hear suggestions about how the CMAC model could be further improved and evolved; and, as ever, I am keen for people to educate themselves about acupuncture, to help fight against the misguided myths that have arisen about it, and to spread the word about this affordable, effective, environmentally-friendly and humane form of medicine!</p>\n\n<p>Steve Wheeler, Lic.

Hopefully it gives you a peek inside the very personal experience of being part of a sort of grand thing \u2013 a network of people becoming active in the healthcare provision chain and caring for each other despite not having met. \xa0</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Noemi:</strong> <strong>Introduce us to the time when the cytostatics network came about. Was someone ill able or unable to access treatment from healthcare providers? How did they go by?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sabina</strong>: It was the fall of 2009 when it all started for me: the dizziness, the fatigue, trouble breathing, walking, doing\xa0 basically anything. In October, I just put it on my crazy life style: mother of two, finishing the PhD, teaching at the Music University.</p>\n\n<p>\xa0In November it was clear something else was going on. So I went to a private lab- the thought of a state hospital was too scary- and had a blood work done. Except it did not work the usual way: the results could not be read due to a strange characteristic of the sample.</p>\n\n<p>I knew it was a bad sign, so I turned to my adoptive grandmother, dr. Mirjam Bercovici. <ins>S</ins>he figured it out in minutes, wrote me a recommendation letter and sent me to a real hospital. Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia \u2013 a very rare blood disease- was confirmed and three years of fighting it in Romania and Austria followed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did she know and how does this relate to the problems of cytostatics in Romania?</strong></p>\n\n<p>For many years, Mirjam, a hematologist, was the chief of the Pediatric Department in the oncologic ward of the biggest hospital in Romania: Fundeni. She was now long retired, but still having nightmares about kids who could not be saved. Because, you see, even though the treatment had clear indications about when and how to give the medicines, they were not always available. The doctors in her section did miracles. Curing cancer without the necessary drugs is indeed a miracle. The always missed some important dose, they could not offer the kids the standard treatment their colleagues in the West were used to. It was the communist era and everything was very difficult, even for the most important health care center in the country.</p>\n\n<p>So when she sent me there, she knew that I would receive the best possible care, but she was also aware of the limitations of a poor system, as populated with amazing doctors as it was.</p>\n\n<p>During my time in Fundeni, I spent lots of time with people dealing with forms of blood cancer. I was \u201clucky\u201d: only had to buy once dexamethason\xa0for myself, but they were not so lucky:\xa0 either filling tones of papers to get the newest drugs (the usual line was: we are giving to you, but only with \u201dthe dossier\u201d), either they had to figure out how to obtain certain medication themselves.</p>\n\n<p>But two bone morrow aspirations and numerous transfusions later, when my condition worsened, there were talks about a treatment\xa0 reserved for Hodgkin\'s lymphoma, Mabthera, or Rituximab. Rituximab was not approved in AutoImmune Hemolytic Anemia in Romania at that time. It still isn\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Was anyone inside hospitals listening or fighting back?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The situation was rather strange. The drug was expensive, not approved for my AIHA, but\xa0available in theory. My roommates\xa0 with Lymphoma could get it based on the dossier (so not standard). But they were missing other drugs, cheaper cytostatics like Bleomicin, compensated 100% from the state! It was like in the times when Mirjam Bercovici was active, all over again. Like nothing had changed in 40 years. Frustration was working both sides, because treatments sessions were postponed, sick people and doctors being equally worried.</p>\n\n<p>All I knew was that doctors advised patients to figure out how to get the drugs. I had no idea how the people got it, as I was preoccupied with my own, at that time unsolvable, health issues.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/bded37e36f49f69a333631a40e306029068e345e" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bded37e36f49f69a333631a40e306029068e345e.jpg" class="lightbox" title="maxresdefault.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bded37e36f49f69a333631a40e306029068e345e_1_690x388.jpg" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">maxresdefault.jpg</span><span class="informations">1920x1080 125 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>Tell us how</strong><strong>\xa0one would send or get medicine, about the network and how it worked. Were people afraid of the (il)legality of all this?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Drained both mentally and financially, I moved to Vienna, became self employed, paid a high tax on healthcare, tried Rituximab with very little success, worked throughout my illness and also got a splenectomy when a terrible\xa0 relapse made it clear there is no other way out of this. A few months after, I read an article on a website: How I became a member in the cytostatic network. There were many similarities with my struggle: people not having access to medication as cheap as dexamethason, a description of the oldest Pharmacy in Vienna, which I knew so well, and most of all, the solidarity.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks later though, I joined the network of Cytostatics.\xa0 I was going home for a concert and my good friend Simona Tache shared a status form a Youngman\xa0who asked if someone is going to Bucharest from Vienna. I knew exactly what it was about, the dots were easy to connect.</p>\n\n<p>I met Vlad Voiculescu that evening, and the next day I followed the instructions and took the\xa0 transport to Bucharest. Basically, transportation worked like this: You take the medicines in a thermal bag, put it in the fridge and take them out only when you leave the house for the airport. At the security, you take it out and tell the officers you have sensitive medicine there. Sometime they ask you who is it for, sometimes they don\u2019t. You are only allowed to have it for your self or\xa0 your family. For me, anyone suffering in Romania is family\u2026.so it never felt like lying.</p>\n\n<p>In Bucharest, you had Valeriu waiting for you at the airport, or you met him later in the day. Valeriu is a taxi driver who delivers the cytostatics to the Pavel Association \u2013 a NGO working for the children in Fundeni, or directly to the ones in need, sick people or caregivers. The news about the Network circulated by word of mouth. Some people knew about its existence, some didn\u2019t. The only thing they knew is that there is someone in Vienna who buys medicines if you give him the prescription and that you can pay him when you can. There was no financial gain, on the contrary. Vlad would receive the prescriptions, buy the cytostatics out of his own pocket and then got the money later. Or much later. No deadlines, no pressure. Just the will to help.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Were all members sufferers or family of sufferers? Was anybody other than Vlad in charge?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When the article about the Network emerged, over 300 people joined the network through the website medicamente-lipsa.ro and found ways to bring home what was missing. Not all of them had sick members of their families. For most, it was just the little they could do in this horrible situation. The website was Med-Alert \u2018s Association\u2019 initiative, where Vlad is a founder, and there were more people involved in obtaining the cytostatics and other medicines. Still, Vlad is the one who got the dice rolling. He has the gift of inspiring others to do good, and it\u2019s contagious. Even though the majority of people involved did not now about each other, and many still do not know until this day, as little contact between the carriers of the medicines has happened. Still, the ones who met in real life bonded immediately and I will always state that the main gain of the Network was the amazing friendships resulting from it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did things eventually change and what\u2019s the situation so far?</strong></p>\n\n<p>After the article on Hotnews about the Network, a\xa0high number of interviews with the authorities filled the tv news evening after evening. The situation was indeed outrageous: you pay the taxes, you have medicine 100% compensated by the state because you pay those taxes, but when it comes to it, they are nowhere available in Romania, and you have to buy them outside the country.\xa0 Cornered by jurnalists, the Minister of Health made hundreds of promises, with some results. Things were sometimes better, and sometimes worse. <em>The whole System in itself acted like a cancer: remissions and relapses.</em></p>\n\n<p>At the moment, Vlad Voiculescu is the new Minister of Health. After a tragic event in October 2015, known as the <ins><a href="/t/when-mass-protests-can-barely-begin-to-solve-it/4923">Colectiv fire</a></ins>, where 64 people died, the whole Government was changed and a lot of young \u2013 under 45- dynamic people were named in key positions.</p>\n\n<p>One of the actions that Vlad took in the short period of time he\u2019s been in charge is to make a\xa0smart alliance with\xa0 more countries: Bulgaria, Moldova, Croatia, Latvia, Macedonia, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia and Slovakia,\xa0 in order to get better access to medication. More countries means more people, so a much\xa0 bigger market, a fact that would discourage the Pharma companies to ignore it by withdrawing a medicine\xa0 by citing\xa0 small numbers in sales.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do you think was the reason for people to participate so actively? If it were another problem and not a deadly disease, would they mobilize as much?</strong><a name="_GoBack"></a></p>\n\n<p>The Public opinion in Romania is, unfortunately, used to crises and bad situation concerning healthcare. The media is full of fundraising events for children or young people who need to get treatment abroad, the news are full of reports of malfunctions of the healthcare system.</p>\n\n<p>In all this mess, there will always be people willing to contribute in any way to the wellbeing of others.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/e566a4833cb770e310baf5a297336ea4dab4eee8" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e566a4833cb770e310baf5a297336ea4dab4eee8.jpg" class="lightbox" title="_IGP0081.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e566a4833cb770e310baf5a297336ea4dab4eee8_1_680x499.jpg" width="680" height="499"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">_IGP0081.jpg</span><span class="informations">800x588 56.3 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>But maybe the reason of this high rate participation in the network of cytostatics is older than we think, with roots in the communist era. Back then, there was a solution for everything: from lack of food to lack of clothes. Everyone knew someone who could help. The only area not available for this kind of help was healthcare. Both doctors and patients were helpless against a system that didn\u2019t truly provide for its beneficiaries. So people developed a true phobia of hospitals, seen as horrible places, dirty and dangerous, a place where some medical act was provided, but where the family took care of the sick person in the most common sense of the term: from bed sheets to food and hygiene products. The 80s and the 90s were the worse years in terms of healthcare.\xa0 The money was less and less, the needs higher.</p>\n\n<p>The Network did not come out of nowhere. It came from a long series of malfunctions and struggles, from a time\xa0 filled with nightmares that still populates one of the best Romanian doctor\u2019s dreams.</p>\n\n<p><i>The production of this\xa0article was supported by\xa0</i><a href="/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296"><i>Op3n\xa0Fellowships</i></a><i>\xa0-\xa0an ongoing program for community contributors\xa0during May - November 2016.</i></p>', u'post_id': 517, u'user_id': 3333, u'timestamp': u'2016-07-25 12:02:02', u'title': u'The Cytostatics Network seen through the eyes of a member'}, {u'content': u'<p>My name is Erika. With Luca, Jacopo and Alice we started\xa0<a href="http://www.dynamoscopio.it" rel="nofollow noopener">Dynamoscopio</a>\xa0("those who observe change"). We are a strange mix of designers, researchers, and practitioners of urban transformation. We are anthropologists, architects, economists.</p>\n\n<p>In 2012 we got interested in a neighborhood called Giambellino-Lorenteggio, in Milan. It was undergoing change, and a tension ran through it. Its eastern end is a heavily hipsterized area, with lofts and cool parties connected with the mighty\xa0<a href="http://www.salonemilano.it/" rel="nofollow noopener">Furniture Fair</a>. To the west there are large industrial settlements (Vodafone Italia, for example). Line 4 of the Metro is under construction here. The value of real estate is going up, or soon will. But the neighborhood itself remains low-income, home to many marginalized people. 25,000 people here qualify for subsidized-rent accommodation. Many of them can survive only because they do live in subsidized housing. Many more would have a right to, but the city does not have enough apartments available. So they are stuck in a queue.</p>\n\n<p>The neighborhood was (and still is) vulnerable to gentrification. It only takes a small increase in rents to price many people out of the neighborhood. We took a political stance that people should not be driven out, and moved in.</p>\n\n<p>First we investigated the area, and put our findings into a documentary film (<a href="http://vimeo.com/62602757" rel="nofollow noopener">trailer</a>). As we did so, we fell in love with the local market,\xa0<a href="http://www.dynamoscopio.it/portfolio_page/mlo/" rel="nofollow noopener">Mercato Lorenteggio</a>\xa0(henceforth ML). This market had a problem: in 2005 a large supermarket had moved into the area. Its competition was driving many local shops out of business \u2013 including several of those in ML. It was clear that the market was on its way out.</p>\n\n<p>By then, we had figured out that the neighborhood lacked resilience. Nonlocal Milanese never go there, and why would they? And even the locals do not form the thick web of social relationships you find in a healthy community. We knew one thing: working in Lorenteggio meant spending most of our time dragging people out of their apartments.</p>\n\n<p>We tried to draw a sort of map of desires and problems surrounding the market. We mapped the social actors around it: the local people, the municipality, the nonlocal Milanese, the shopkeepers. The shopkeepers seemed the most promising agent of change. They are local businesspeople: if the neighborhood does well, they do well. ML itself could serve as a focal point. If we could revive it, we could show the local community that it can work its way out of a bad situation.</p>\n\n<p>So we did several things.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tWith the shopkeepers, we redefined ML\'s unique value proposition. The supermarket would always beat us on price, and on opening hours. So we invented a brand we call DOP, Denominazione di Origine Popolare (People\'s Designation of Origin). This means local products \u2013 Milano is a farming city, with many farms to the immediate south of the city. It also mean "new local" products, for example we sell\xa0<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eragrostis_tef" rel="nofollow noopener">teff</a>\xa0used in Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisine.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tWe made it clear that these businesses are the natural allies of the neighborhood. For example, we have solidarity campaigns. One is called "Fai la spesa per la tua scuola" (shop for your school). Shopkeepers donate part of their income to the local elementary school. Other local partners expressed interest in participating.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tWe mobilized the community on restoring the fa\xe7ade of the ML building. A Milan-based company donated the materials; the local people contributed manpower. Physical work on the space creates ownership and mobilization. Also, it was a great party (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MercatoLorenteggio/videos/1798039877129281/" rel="nofollow noopener">timelapse video</a>)!</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tWe pushed the mixed use of ML as a place for culture and socializing as well as commerce. For example, we organize courses of Arabic languages (requested by many migrant families), knitting events, etc. The market has wide corridors, and can host up to 1,000 people.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tWe moved in ourselves. Dynamoscopio runs a tiny cultural space (20 square meters) inside ML. We offer wi-fi too.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>In general, we are trying to reinvent the physical space of ML and the kind of local commerce that it offers.</p>\n\n<p>Who pays for this? We started out with grants. Milan is home to several charitable foundations, and some of them focus on the poorer neighborhoods. With time, we are moving towards a more sustainable mix of revenue streams. Even the shopkeepers, now, are chipping in: this is great, because it a sign of increased sustainability. Also, the work we do in Lorenteggio is good PR, and it helps Dynamoscopio get clients.</p>\n\n<p>We think we are carers, in a way. We care for the community as a whole, rather than for any one person in it. "Taking care" in this context means keeping ML open and thriving; and that, in turn, means contributing to them getting income. The shops in ML are holding the line of the viability of the whole community.</p>\n\n<p>We are not open by default, but we do use some of the strategies of the open source movement. Example: some migrant families from Arabophone countries wanted courses of Arabic for the children. We helped them set them up, and set them up in the market. The logic is this: if the market becomes an open platform for people to do stuff, more people will go there. This will create more business opportunities for the shops: you went for the Arabic lesson, it makes sense to do your groceries there too.</p>\n\n<p>Considering, our work with ML is going rather well. In 2012 it was on its way out, with several shops closed: in 2016 all stalls are in use, and the market is thriving. The space has become more beautiful and welcoming.</p>\n\n<p>Still, there are many things we would like to improve. For example, last year we organized two "swap markets", and they failed badly. Both events were popular, with a lot of people in attendance. But these were people from outside the neighborhood, many of them hipsters. This created tension, because the locals see them as harbingers that they will be priced out of the neighborhood. Another pain point is that we are unable to monitor our impact. Shopkeepers are reluctant to disclose how much money they are making. We do not even have a system to count the number of people present in the market. We would love to have some kind of tool, but somehow this sort of work always gets deprioritized, there is so much to do.</p>\n\n<p>Also, we are not sure how much longer we can afford to stay engaged with ML. But we worry. What happens when we stop pushing? Another example: for a while, a guy named Manuel ran a vegetable garden outside ML. People loved it. But when Manuel withdrew, the whole thing dried out. These dynamics look great, but they are not always sustainable.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know of any similar experience? We would love to compare notes.</p>', u'post_id': 804, u'user_id': 3515, u'timestamp': u'2016-12-21 13:59:52', u'title': u'Mercato Lorenteggio (Milan), an intersection of care practices'}, {u'content': u"<p>When we arrived to move into the house, we seemed like an unlikely crew. There were three lads living there already - Kieron, Dave and Billy. Kieron was the leader. He had a drill. Billy was very pale and very thin - kind of morose somehow while at the same time desperately optimistic. He looked like he hadn't seen a vitamin in months. Dave on the other hand, was just mad. At this point, quite obviously, even certifiably, mad. Just a week or so before he had actually escaped from the psychiatric hospital over the road, bringing to mind a scene from 'One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest'. And over the course of our time together, Dave told me a few stories about that place, that enlightened paragon of metal health provision which had held him body and soul for all of nine months. He told me how he preferred prison, because at least in prison you got a release date. He told me about the electric shock therapy, which left your mind totally scrambled for two or three days, then left you feeling more or less ok for two or three days but with no memory, after which they did it all over again. He told me about being chained to four big guys who were there to 'look after him', even when he went to the toilet. About how if he didn't go along with something that they wanted him to do, sooner or later he'd get held down and recieve a knock-out shot delivered to his buttock, which resulted in unconsciousness and a noticeable reduction in his ability to stand up for his rights. Essentially, he didn't have any rights. He was mad. They could do whatever they wanted to him. The detail that most appealed to my Kafkaesque understanding of faceless institutions, was that the refusal to accept that he was mad was taken as evidence that he was still mad. Refusing to take the pills that made him heavy and slow and stupid was seen as proof that his sanity had still not returned. Now you just try to imagine regaining your mental balance under this kind of perverse authority. They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but I'm not so sure I believe them. Dave's approach was to break out of the place and find himself a squat to live in with a couple of mates and several total strangers, one of whom had been recognised by Kieron from a free party, when they bumped into each other down at the job centre. Its amazing what gets hatched down at the job centre, and I'm not talking about anyone finding a job. But anyway, when we turned up at the squat, Dave was living on the sofa in the lounge in a haze of ashtray cigarettes and cheap cider, eyeing the curtains nervously and never far away from a large knife. You got the feeling he was pretty keen never to go back inside that place if there was anything he had to say about it. And he wasn't leaving the house, or even that room much at this time. Absconders from mental health institutions tend to be automatically served with arrest warrants by the local magistrates, and I don't suppose that was helping his mental health any either. Dave seemed to be doing pretty well as far as I could see, considering everything that he'd gone through so far in his life. He told me his Dad was always drunk and often violent. He said his mother had been killed, shot by a farmer standing in front of her dog trying to protect him while out for a walk. That was when he left home. He'd had a job as the look-out for a gang of thieves that robbed industrial units at the age of nine. A little later he'd gone to live with a family of Irish travellers who'd trained him to be a bareknuckle boxer, a discipline at which he was apparently quite talented. Some time after that he'd bought a house, back when they gave mortgages to people with no job, no credit rating and no intention whatsoever to make even a single repayment. That episode lasted a few months, during which time he acquired an addiction to crack and heroin, or 'brown n white' as it was known on the estate. That was when the mental health issues really kicked in. I could sometimes see the different personalities fighting for control inside Dave's head. So much suffering just couldn't be contained inside one self-image, so the ever resourceful ego just created a couple of others to help take the strain. I think it was fair to say that Dave was feeling the pressure. And of course, he couldn't go to get any medication, because he knew the Doctor would just arrange to have him arrested as soon as he arrived at his appointment. </p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, Kieron and Billy were quite happy to have Dave and his knives living on the sofa. After all, this was a squat, and you never know what might go down. Sometimes you have to defend a place, and while Kieron liked his drill, that was about the limit of his handiness. And if anything serious went off you'd most likely find Billy in a cupboard. So Dave had his uses. And anyway, they were mates. But in this condition, he wasn't exactly easy company. So naturally, Billy and Kieron started to pal up a little. They shared a floor in the house with a kitchen in it, they went outside from time to time. They liked to get stoned together, and have a laugh. But this was unsettling to Dave somehow. He'd been mates with Billy for years, since the time he bought the house. He had no family left, no real friends after all the alcoholism, the drugs, the crime, and the madness. Billy was about all he had. And now he was feeling him drifting away. It all came to a head one full moon. It 'd been building for a while. You could feel it all through the house, under the neon strip lights in the corridors. Tension. The more Dave got wound up, the more Kieron and Billy retreated into their little flat. Sometimes you could hear him shouting incoherently in the lounge on his own. It wasn't very reassuring. But on this particular night, we found him shouting slightly more coherently, and it wasn't at himself. It was directed at Kieron. Dave was pacing the lounge, muttering to himself, wild-eyed. Then suddenly, something snapped. He grabbed his largest knife from under the cushions of the sofa and stormed out in the direction of the stairs. Larissa, sharp as ever, phoned Kieron fast and told him to lock his door. She was just in time. </p>\n\n<p>'Yer fuckin big gay bastard! Open t'door.' </p>\n\n<p>'Fuck off Dave' said Kieron, with his foot set hard against the door to keep his demented friend from getting in. </p>\n\n<p>It wasn't looking good. Dave was stabbing the door repeatedly with his enormous blade, while Kieron, who fortunately for him liked to eat a hearty meal, was leaning against it with all his weight. </p>\n\n<p>'Open t'door or I'll fookin kill yer both'</p>\n\n<p>If I open t'door, that's when you'll fookin kill us both, was more what it looked like. </p>\n\n<p>The rest of us were gathering downstairs in the lounge. We'd known these people a week, and this was the only place we had to live. We were not ecstatic about the situation. And besides, we were worried, as much for Dave as for Kieron and Billy. We really liked Dave. He was a lovely lad, underneath all the addictive behaviour, the paranoia and the threat of imminent violence. I'd had a good connection with him from the start. We both had Irish ancestry. We shared a dark sense of humour. Dave's kind of funny was to make unbelievably hot curries, knowing that Billy didn't like them, but that he had no money and that there was no other food in the house. And then to watch Billy eating them, as his face got redder and redder, and his expressions grew ever more absurd. That was like Dave's perfect joke. So anyway, I headed up the stairs, with Dom close behind. The stairwell was pulsating, neon, harsh light. Nowhere to hide. Kieron's door was closed now, with the giant knife stuck in it, wobbling, and Dave half-shouting half-sobbing, desperately scared of losing his friend, his mind, his freedom. I wondered about his family history, and how much comprehension he had of his own emotional reality. It can't have been easy for him. And I thought about my own safety. But however erratic he'd been acting, I didn't feel any kind of malicious intent would be directed towards me.</p>\n\n<p>'Dave, Dave. Dave man, it's me.'</p>\n\n<p>Dave was in his own world, and it was breaking down.</p>\n\n<p>'Dave, what's up man? Why don't you put the knife down?'</p>\n\n<p>He kicked the door a couple of times, just desperate now, more than dangerous. My heart broke for him.</p>\n\n<p>'Dave, you're bleeding mate! Look. Let me see that hand.'</p>\n\n<p>Dave looked at his palm, which had been cut by the knife as he had rammed it repeatedly into the door. It wasn't serious, but it was badly enough to make a fair mess. The sight of his own blood seemed to bring him back to himself. All the fight had gone out of him now. You could see he was ready to be taken care of.</p>\n\n<p>'You should get that seen to Dave. You want me to come with you mate, we'll go down to the A&amp;E dept at the bottom of the road?'</p>\n\n<p>He let me lead him away, still staring at his bloody palm, and I placed my arm around his shoulders as Dom discretely removed the knife from the door and hid it out of sight. The crisis it seemed, was over. At least for now. But still, we had an evidently pretty broken human being on our hands, and what the hell were we going to do about that? </p>", u'post_id': 502, u'user_id': 3289, u'timestamp': u'2016-05-08 00:48:50', u'title': u'Care in the Community'}, {u'content': u'<p>Today I and <a class="mention" href="/u/nadia">@Nadia</a> discussed the tasks for the upcoming weeks that will bring us closer to establishing both the permanent space for Edgeryders somewhere in Europe and help us build the annual event.

One look at the map of the region is enough to understand how difficult for them it would be to access hospitals and doctors otherwise. 2500 islands sit on the Indian part of the river, which starts from the Tibetan mountains and flows through the Assam region, being a home to 3 million people, 10% of the region\u2019s population.</p>\n\n<p>There are numerous reasons why providing these places with health care is particularly difficult: due to huge shortages of doctors in India to start with (0.7 per 1000 people), shifting territories of these islands, unstable population and difficult living conditions: they\u2019re connected to the land by boats and suffer from frequent energy and drinking water deficit. Not to mention strikingly high numbers in maternal and infant mortality.</p>\n\n<p>Sanjoy Hazarika pitched the idea of floating clinics to the World Bank in 2000 and received their support - 20,000 dollars to start with. One year later the first boat sailed to bring care to the Assamese, and until today, 14 more followed. The project was eventually joined by the state, which established a public-private partnership with the trust and started funding the offered service. Each month around 20.000 people in total are reached by these facilities.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the doctors who joined the ships helped to improve their service. One of the keys to success is frequency - by ensuring that each island is visited at least once a month it is possible to take good care of immunization and condition of pregnant women. They also bring the basic medicine, which is cheap in India - but if one needs to hire a boat to get it, the costs soar.</p>\n\n<p>And the service provided by the boat is free - the funds provided by the state amount for 72 400 000 million rupees per year - which, after covering the costs of the boat and the staff, means that there are 480 rupees per person left. Around 5 dollars per year.</p>\n\n<p>More about the project here: <a href="http://www.c-nes.org/programmes/boat-clinics">http://www.c-nes.org/programmes/boat-clinics</a></p>\n\n<p>Photo comes from\xa0<a href="http://www.tehelka.com/2014/07/boat-clinics-provide-healthcare-to-3-million-people-in-assams-river-islands/">http://www.tehelka.com/2014/07/boat-clinics-provide-healthcare-to-3-million-people-in-assams-river-islands/</a></p>', u'post_id': 708, u'user_id': 137, u'timestamp': u'2016-07-24 16:55:49', u'title': u'On delivering care - MV Akha in Assam'}, {u'content': u'<p>Summer 2015. It was nearly the end of August when Kos Island turned into a battlefield during a registration procedure. Hundreds of protesting migrants demanding quick registration began blocking the main coastal road. The local police attempted to break up the crowd with batons and by spraying foam with fire extinguishers. An officer was being filmed slapping and shoving migrants queueing outside the local police station.</p>\n\n<p>My grandmother came to mind and her story as a refugee child from the area of Pontos (Northern Turkey) in 1922. I just couldn\u2019t believe that something like that could happen again. Despite the fact that Greece, in the throes of its worst ever financial crisis, was straining to accommodate the inflow, most Greek islanders were doing their best. But still there was an ominous feeling in the air.</p>\n\n<p>And then I saw that photo. A young woman with her two frightened children hanging onto her arms. Walking to nowhere, barefoot. Beyond endurance, angry but determined to survive the crush. Fearless, though! Imperious! I got angry. I stood beside her, out there in the dust. I\'m just one step away from being like her.</p>\n\n<p>That moment I realized that there isn\u2019t any Deus ex Machina to save them. To save us.</p>\n\n<p>So, I started thinking\u2026 What would I need if I were there? What should I carry to help my children withstand it? What should I bring with me for a little break? ...and their feet! What will happen to their feet? And the sun? It\'s hard being a parent in peace.

The obvious, the necessary, even those things that seemed unnecessary. The goal was to ease the burden of parents, to give a smile to children. A breath until the next aid. A hope...</p>\n\n<p>I post the list in my private facebook profile. I couldn\u2019t imagine the impact of this simple action. In a few days people were coming to my place, bringing bags full of nearly everything! Friends, neighbors or strangers were coming to help. We\u2018ve been preparing backpacks and sending them to Idomeni, to the islands or anywhere they were needed. Many schools adopted the idea and soon the campaign went viral. In around 8 months, hundreds of people became mobilized and focused on helping this endless wave.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that we could tell a lot of stories about, and because of this, but the point now is what emerged from this need. There\'s a lot of information coming out in the aftermath of this experience.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a mountain of questions that we didn\u2019t answer\u2026</p>\n\n<p><em>Is there any kind of system in the world that could cope with that amount of people?</em></p>\n\n<p>What was wrong and why didn\'t anyone know how to react or to organize?</p>\n\n<p>Why weren\'t we ready? Why didn\'t governments, NGO\u2019s and independent groups cooperate? And when they did, what happened?</p>\n\n<p>What socks are most appropriate for their long trek?</p>\n\n<p>How can we fit all the necessary items in a backpack?</p>\n\n<p>And what about the weight?</p>\n\n<p>How can we gather the right clothing from the world?</p>\n\n<p>Have you ever try to sort thousands of clothes?</p>\n\n<p>Is it true that women from Syria didn\u2019t want to wear rain boots?</p>\n\n<p>And what about UNHCR\u2019s wool blanket?</p>\n\n<p>And all those tons of food wrappers, wet wipes, bottles...?</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, it turns out that there was no rescue plan in place. Greece seems to be inefficient and Europe appears like an impregnable fortress. This brings up the question \u201cWhat if a sudden disaster left millions of Greeks or other Europeans homeless and helpless?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Local authorities and their services operated superficially while the government was obviously unprepared. On the other hand, citizens reacted vigorously and passionately despite the fact that they didn\u2019t mobilize immediately.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s also notable that many conferences, workshops or unofficial brainstorming meetings took place and new technology-oriented groups were created.\xa0 New ideas and solutions were proposed and innovative applications were developed from people all over the world. However, most of those didn\u2019t fall on fertile ground for wide use, thus must be investigated thoroughly in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Due to my profession as a fashion designer and manufacturer, when I heard about all those calls for clothing needs I started wondering who will manage all these diverse supplies. When facing a disaster, food and medical aid are considered top priorities but it\u2019s not widely known that wearing inappropriate clothing under extreme conditions can become life threatening.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s noteworthy that if we focus on specific issues we can come to interesting conclusions e.g. Public misinformation by \u201cofficial\u201d announcements that were based on internet searching or common knowledge about clothing. As a result, there was a shortage of A-shirts (tank tops) while, considered useless, thousands of used socks were gathered although it costs less to buy new ones. Also, acrylic socks were suggested as the most appropriate. But when there\u2019s no luxury of changing them anytime, other materials are more suitable like; wool, bamboo, cotton, tactel etc.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, a problem, arisen from common everyday items, is more complicated than initially thought and requires an expert\'s opinion.</p>\n\n<p>So, without surprise, no one reached out to experts from the clothing sector for professional advice and assistance. Moreover both government and UNHCR ignored any proposals or contact efforts.</p>\n\n<p>Surely, the day after was going to be a nightmare. Inexperienced volunteers struggled to adequately classify, pack and distribute huge amounts of donations. Very often the same material had to be sorted again and again for multiple times. The inadequate coordination among government authorities, NGOs, solidarity groups and other stakeholders in combination with the anxiety of refugees led to a disappointing result. Large amounts of food, clothing, medicines and a lot of useless things (that could be a separate funny story), were being carried around Greece like a giant pinball machine. Unnecessary shipments, aid wasted, corrupted by mold, insects or still remain in inappropriate warehouses. A serious waste of resources.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the refugee crisis gave rise to a strong solidarity network and also an opportunity for local communities and the society in total. An innovative strategic plan seems to be a necessity, in order to coordinate and manage all the available resources successfully.</p>\n\n<p>We should focus on organizing and training ourselves for cases of emergency. Based on the strength of these sharing communities, we should work, in innovative ways, which could bring people together around common concerns, recognize and increase their skills and knowledge and instill in them a belief that they can make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, it\u2019s important to develop a survival handbook with the aim to provide \u201chow-to\u201d guidance based on practical experience in combination with academic knowledge. And the challenge is to respond to all these arisen questions. Or add new.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCould humanitarianism be evolved as a profession or it could be a new way of living?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>P. S.</p>\n\n<p>More than 1/5 of donations is unsuitable for the refugees, thus is channeled to other vulnerable groups directly or in cooperation with already existing structures.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the volunteers gave up, burned out or feeling unable to help. Meanwhile the main responsible for this failure get paid.</p>\n\n<p>More than 60.000 refugees stuck in Greece. The majority were transferred to military camps, old factory warehouses or other abandoned and unhealthy places. Out of sight, out of mind.

I hear a lot about that here we work a lot about societal diversity, but not generational diversity</p>\n\n<p><strong>About people sleeping in the streets:</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the first things I noticed in Brussels is that a lot of people are living in the streets. Why are they living in the streets, don\u2019t they have families to take care of them? Where are the families of the homeless people? I never saw anyone homeless in Syria, or living on a mattress.

I saw two big strands in the conversation that can inform our search:</p>\n\n<p><b>A. Is it safer for an online conversation to only deal with the soft side of mental health? That is, exclude suicide and death?\xa0</b></p>\n\n<p>Noemi mentioned how deep suicide is in Ireland both among males and females, as well as it is underreported - it\u2019s not even ranking top in Europe (like former Soviet countries). Pauline added that in Sweden, suicide is the most common cause of death in people between 18-35. Costantino said this was dangerous to approach in OpenCare, even though we know it\u2019s increasingly being flagged in the tech activist sector (see re:Publica session <a href="https://re-publica.de/16/session/hacking-care">Hacking with Care</a>).</p>\n\n<p><a href="/t/jus-design-for-vulnerability/645">Team JUS</a> was on board!\xa0They\u2019re working on design that explores vulnerability: <em>We want to research objects that people are handling or certain gestures they are doing while in therapy. Can we find a certain patterns in these behaviours or interactions? Maybe we can do something with it? We found in the interviews/chats we started with our peers as well that it was very difficult for them to open up. We also had some observations how to create a sharing environment</em></p>\n\n<p>Their design will most probably involve</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tHuman connection\xa0- "if you just throw your thoughts in the air without any feedback it is less interesting than if you are sharing with people with whom you have an intimate relationship" (Nadia).</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tSome external tokens to facilitate this, like\xa0objects (bridging connection between repetitive gestures and calming yourself down); maybe\xa0space (pop-up confession booths).</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p><b>B.

This device is designed to address the rising incidence of breast cancer in developing countries where women have limited or no access to breast cancer screening services.</p>\n\n<p>The test is painless and radiation free, and takes less than 5 minutes to complete. The device can be used by any doctor or health worker and the results are available at the point-of-care.ibreastexam\xa0assesses differences in tissue elasticity between malignant and non-cancerous breast tissue, and its tactile sensor measures shear stiffness and tissue compression when applied to the skin.</p>\n\n<p>A clinical study\xa0conducted in India reported that the test maintained high specificity and outperformed an expert clinician who conducted a conventional clinical breast examination. All malignant lesions were identified by the device, while the clinician failed to identify a non-palpable lesion.</p>\n\n<p>UE Lifesciences won the 2016 Hitlab world cup at the Hitlab Innovators Summit in New York for their ibreastexam\xa0system.

Formal politics not leading to a better future or present</p>\n\n<p>If we want to change it\u2019s not about political programs or manifestos. Change comes from the edge and seeps into the centre. If the edge and centre disconnect how do you create the conditions for change? These communities we are discovering\xa0need to be articulating demands which are somehow legible to politicians.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tYou need to look towards satisfying material needs of those who are seeking these changes. People lose steam, no business model for this work (the equivalent of unMonastery)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tMany initiative reinvent the wheel, not learning from each other,\xa0and make unnecessary mistakes because collaboration between these initaitives are too time consuming</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tThe demands don\u2019t gel together to create new constituentinces to drive political change (bring new people into politics ad remove the old)</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Communities try to fix their own worlds, based on what works for them. In order to solve the above, you need to have:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tunMonasteries or equivalent\xa0in communities for long enough to foster true collaboration and trust between community and innovators\xa0- especially in damaged communities</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tIncentivise projects and people to work through ER ways (documentation and online communication), understand that\xa0the world is big and they have allies.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tTeaching people to use the collective intelligence methods to\xa0understand, articulate insights\xa0and make very concrete demands</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Health and social care is the number one destroyer or communities ability to be self sufficient. Care is such a point of vulnerability: the biggest challenge is getting time for a doctor/GP to see you. But it\'s\xa0also the fastest way to develop trust in a community to provide health services. Time and person to person contact.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>How do we get there?</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tGo out a meet groups that are already doing these things. Build relationships with them.

Not everywhere we go and ideas sparkle we can make things happen. It takes time and a certain skillset to seize\xa0these opportunities.\xa0- Is Galway an example of developing in a hands off way?</p>\n\n<p>Nadia: Yes, We have to have plan the growth\xa0and take time on the ground with communities.

Currently, the following\xa0is (mainly) what I am busy with:</p>\n\n<p><strong>URGENCI</strong> \u2013 The Global Network for Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)</p>\n\n<p>Since June 2015 I am a member of the Urgenci kernel -the steering committee for the European part of the movement, and the European Research Group on CSA -with which we conducted the first ever European census on CSA -the report can be found <a href="http://urgenci.net/new-report-european-csa-overview-released-by-the-european-csa-research-group/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. Our second major undertaking for 2015-2016 was the creation of a European Declaration on CSA. This involved the research group drafting a first proposal which we had to take back to our respective countries for consultations and then collectivise everything again and come up with a final draft that was formally presented at the third European meeting on CSA (the report on that will be out soon, but <a href="http://ostrava.urgenci.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> you can find out more about what we did in Ostrava). Here is the <a href="http://urgenci.net/the-european-csa-declaration-adopted-in-ostrava/" rel="nofollow noopener">declaration</a> and this is footage from the historical moment of its first announcement:</p>\n\n<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="sQi1BKLFWzc" data-youtube-title="European CSA Declaration" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>\n\n<p>The writing process for the declaration gave me the chance to organise a two-day event where those already working in CSAs in Greece had the chance to meet in person for the first time -a valuable experience. We also held \u2018a CSA open day\u2019 where a team of experts (accountant, lawyer, personal growth coach, farmers, CSA coordinators) had the chance to explain various aspects of the CSA idea.</p>\n\n<p>I am also very glad to say I was part in the inaugural meeting for the <a href="http://urgenci.net/the-mediterranean-csa-project/" rel="nofollow noopener">Mediterranean Network for Local-Based Solidarity Partnerships</a> which we hope will strengthen the ties between our countries and projects.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Action Research through participatory video making</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the capacity of co-facilitator I am working together with Christabel Buchanan -from the Coventry Centre for Agroecology Water and Resilience, on \u2018Real Food Utopias\u2019: an action research project mapping and tracking alternative food systems and economies in and around Thessaloniki. We made an open call inviting individuals from a variety of formal and informal groups. Through this process we came up collectively with a series of themes to be further explored. We then held training sessions on participatory video-making (from story boarding to collective editing) and then formed working groups for each theme. Then we organise public showings to get feedback and to instigate discussion and hopefully action by community members -like the creation of a Food Policy Council.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Currently the themes we are working on are:</strong></p>\n\n<p>-alternative currencies and food economies;</p>\n\n<p>-a look into peri-urban gardening in terms of autonomy and</p>\n\n<p>-the production cycle of vegetables as opposed to that of chicken farming within the project;</p>\n\n<p>-lessons learnt and struggles of existing projects: a critical view on hindrances to growth; -presentation of a social cooperative enterprise.</p>\n\n<p>The first videos are in the final editing process and will be ready soon. This is an ongoing project and you will be able to find out more about it <a href="https://alternativefoodeconomiesgreece.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> as we continue uploading information and new developments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Refugee Food Journeys</strong></p>\n\n<p>As we all know Greece has been struck the hardest from the influx of refugees in recent years and we felt we needed to include them in our quest for food sovereignty. This part of our research focuses on matters of food consumption and food waste in refugee camps. This is our\xa0 first video on this issue:</p>\n\n<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="F1pvIQ_MCA4" data-youtube-title="Refugee Food Journeys - Greece" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>\n\n<p><strong>Solidarity Exports</strong></p>\n\n<p>Together with Antonis Diamantidis, a fellow food sovereignty activist, farmer, and organiser of a CSA group of producers called \u2018Corinthian Orchard\u2019 we have just launched this scheme aiming to create direct links between small agroecological producers of Greece and CSAs, food coops etc in other European countries by providing each party with what they need in a fair and respectful way. Our goal is to not compete with the local farmers and thus we will only export produce that is consumed but does not grow in their regions -like citrus fruits and olive oil. Through this we will be actively supporting small Greek farmers, who suffer from land fragmentation and stand...at the bottom of the food chain with respect to the markets and the middlemen. We are also hoping to include \u2018ugly fruits\u2019 in this scheme raising even more awareness on food dumping/waste/loss issues. For more information on this please look <a href="http://perivolikorinthou.gr/user/login?destination=proionta" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> or write to <a href="mailto:antonis@perivolikorinthou.gr">antonis@perivolikorinthou.gr</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Hellenic Network for Agroecology, Food Sovereignty and Access to Land</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since the crisis begun, it is becoming increasingly difficult to do anything in a formal, legal way. This is one of the main reasons why most groups here operate under the radar -which on the other hand is not necessarily a bad thing. But this means that growth comes in relatively slow steps and is hindered by the lack of access to funds and other resources. For example, setting up an NGO costs around \u20ac1000 and has an annual \u20ac1000 \u2018trade tax\u2019 (literally a levy to allow you to do business) -this applies to social enterprises too. And although this is not as bad as having to prepay 100% of next year\u2019s taxation like with most small businesses (or 50% for farmers) it still might pose a problem for people who want to do exactly that: do something without business profit in mind.</p>\n\n<p>So in this context, I am happy to announce that we are currently in the process of setting up our grass-roots non-profit organisation to to help us with our endeavours in these fields. What we have in mind is summarized in the following fields of action:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tAssist in the creation of a movement on food sovereignty in Greece; link existing initiatives with each other and with similar projects abroad; and promote FS in all ways possible.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tIn collaboration with other European partners (like La Via Campesina and CAWR) set up (a network of) Agroecological Training centres and knowledge exchange hubs. We need to find ways to make our farmers independent form fertiliser companies (even if organic), seed producers and certifying organisations. We need farmers who can stand on their own feet, be self sufficient and knowledgeable to deal with eventualities by using what nature provides.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tSave Greek agricultural land from the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund and ensure its utilization through concession or purchase by our group in the context of communal ownership. This will be a major undertaking ensuring the right of small agroecological farmers to have access to land and safeguarding the land\u2019s status as a common good.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tIncrease awareness and offer technical support, training, and tools to create CSA schemes around the country.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tPromote the creation of Food Policy Councils around the country.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tBecome the official Greek hub for informal groups working on food sovereignty, enabling them to gain access to financial support, tools and other resources.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tIncrease awareness and educate farmers and consumers in order to become more conscious through seminars, campaigns and training sessions about sustainable farming methods and consumption patterns and the agroecological way of life. Also offer tools and training in communication and inner development that are crucial factors for the success of any endeavour (eg non violent communication, social permaculture and inner transition). Needless to say that schools and children will be pivotal in our schemes.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>So if all of this sounds interesting, if you feel the urge to get involved, or if you have information and contacts that can help, please contact me to join forces <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>', u'post_id': 560, u'user_id': 3417, u'timestamp': u'2016-12-21 09:06:42', u'title': u'From eco-activism to Food Sovereignty and beyond\u2026'}, {u'content': u'<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/0/097a32d8f8bbabd2aa8821dad872461b753c611b.jpg" width="250" height="250"></p>\n\n<p><span>Greetings, so after the successful show in Makerfaire Rome, InPe has been getting ready for testing phase.

It is a meeting of people from around the world who are exploring the leading edge of science, social policy, and modern living. So far, <b>LOTE</b> events have been organized in Italy, France, and Belgium; each bringing together over 60 activists, hackers, thinkers, artists, and makers from all around the globe. We have succeeded in creating a unique platform for online and offline meetings between stakeholders from the government, the successful start-up community, and the <i>Edgeryders</i> network. <b>LOTE</b> events are uniquely crafted to create synergies between hosting communities and a broad network of changemakers, both through offline meetings and through access to the vast database of knowledge that the initiatives gathered on the<i> Edgeryders</i> website provide. </span><span></span></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><b><span>LOTE6: The Edge of Care</span></b><span> will be the culmination of an 18-month international project called OpenCare. Through OpenCare we have discovered hundreds of projects changing the landscape of caregiving in their communities. We have been studying innovative aspects of care from around the world and want to come together to discuss, learn and investigate our findings. <b><i>Most importantly we want to do it in your city.</i></b> </span><span></span></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><span>To serve the needs of all our participants and be consistent with our core theme- Care, <b>LOTE6</b> will involve several separate but mutually cohesive tracks of enquiry: physical (body exercising, manual work, therapy etc.), personal (development and growth), and professional/intellectual enquiry. The details of these tracks will be developed and honed over the year by <i>Edgeryders</i> event management team in collaboration with our partners and you, our gracious hosts.</span><span></span></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><i><span>What makes <b>LOTE6</b> special and why do we need your support?</span></i><span></span></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><span>For 2017 <b>LOTE6</b> is taking a hands-on approach.

We want to find projects that approach social, personal, and physical care in new, exciting, and unconventional ways. We are looking to invite projects that tackle access to care; projects that bridge the housing gap, or are investigating the creation of sustainable communities; projects finding innovative ways to access affordable healthcare; and projects that are working on solutions to address the needs of the elderly, migrants, and/or those people in society current underserved or overlooked by the authorities. We believe that all our care needs must be re-addressed to keep pace with the rapidly changing social, economic, political, and cultural landscape of a 21st Century globe.</span><span></span></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><span>We propose to invite those who are already pioneering work in these areas; improving the lives of people in the host city, in the wider country, as well as their peers from all over Europe and the rest of the world. They will come together as partners and co-creators of <b>LOTE6 </b>presenting the fruits of their effort and demonstrating the ability of civil society, social entrepreneurship, and open source innovations to accelerate the solving of complex issues. </span><span></span></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><span>We have experience of connecting to these types of initiative through our work on the Open&amp;Change project. We brought together groups of initiatives in Brussels, New York, Thessaloniki, and Berlin, now we are looking to extend our network into your city; helping you to raise international awareness of the great work that your citizens and organisations are undertaking in your city. <i>Edgeryders</i> event coordinators have skills at finding and reaching out to organisations and initiatives that operate on the fringes as well as in the mainstream. <b>The OpenCare PopUp village </b>will seek to engage public institutions and local businesses in a dialogue about how to provide the best method of access to these products, services, and spaces to disenfranchised members of their communities. As always, <i>Edgeryders </i>will be working on sustainable, long lasting ideas that can support these synergies after the main events end.</span><span></span></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><i><span>Why are we reaching out to new places?</span></i><span></span></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p><p><i><span>Edgeryders</span></i><span> care as much about physical spaces as we do about our online community platform.

So far, we have followed\xa0two different approaches:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\xa0ScImpulse, WeMake and City of Milano focus on an engaging offline experience for participants. Conveners take notes, photos etc. They then editorialize them and upload them onto the platform.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Edgeryders focus on offering people with good stories help for them to put them on the platform. Workshops are organized not by Edgeryders itself (though we do take part), but by active community members. The same also provide most of the help.\xa0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both methods are hard. Both have drawbacks.</p>\n\n<p>The first method is mostly failing. It is difficult to make sense of notes taken during the meeting. I had this experience during "Taking care", where I volunteered to take notes with Cristina. Afterwards, I could interpret my notes, but not hers (though we were using the same \xa0Google Doc! ). I imagine the opposite was true for her. Many notes never make it online. Those that do take the form of a report: "A said this, B said that". The community tends not to engage with this type of format.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The second method has given better results.\xa0\xa0Still,\xa0it discourages people who are not good communicators in writing, face language barriers etc.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>How to move forward? The Milan meeting gave us two promising leads.</p>\n\n<p>The first one was offered by <a class="mention" href="/u/costantino">@costantino</a> and <span class="mention">@alessandrocontini</span> . They pointed out that the mechanics of makers collaboration is not so social. You go to the forum, ask a question, get a pointer, solve the problem and move on. It may be difficult to track it through an online forum.</p>\n\n<p>The second one results from\xa0something interesting that happened during "Taking care". This: people in the Bordeaux group at some point felt their contribution was unnecessary and possibly unwelcome. They withdrew from the workshop and moved to a different room. They kept working on opencare, but in the form of writing code to look at the conversation.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>This resonates with an Edgeryders\xa0conversation thread\xa0that predates opencare.\xa0It says this: the "meeting"\xa0or "assembly" format claims to be inclusive, but in fact it is not. Instead, it rewards extrovert, confident, even narcissistic personalities. Introverts don\'t like to speak in public,\xa0certainly not without thinking things through. So they never speak. This issue has come to the fore in the hacker community, where many skilled developers identify as intros. Intros like online, where they can take time to think things through, and where they do not have to interrupt others to claim space.\xa0See for example\xa0<a href="/t/an-expat-in-bucharest-why-collaboration-is-essential-for-social-entrepreneurship-to-thrive/4536/3">this great comment</a>\xa0by <a class="mention" href="/u/trythis">@trythis</a>\xa0and the thread that comes with it. As a result, offline spaces are exclusionary. They do not know it...\xa0because they exclude\xa0the people who never speak up.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The post-it workshop format has a\xa0second potential problem. It has no space for\xa0contributions\xa0in\xa0forms other than the speech (as Cicero describes in\xa0<em>De Oratore</em>). The role of facilitators is to "standardize" contributions. Some people (like <a class="mention" href="/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> in "Taking care") feel that this negates serendipity and predetermines results.</p>\n\n<p>If this is true, a lot of design-based methods of engagement have a serious flaw. What\'s worse, an\xa0<em>unacknowledged</em>\xa0one. Given their popularity, this is serious.</p>\n\n<p>So, I propose we\xa0"go deep", doing research and producing one or more papers on:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>An ethnography of makers collaboration</strong>. How important is the space? How important is StackOverflow or similar? What constitues "good" collaboration (Alessandro: "the less interactive and more efficient, the better")?\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>A model of the interface between online and\xa0offline collaboration</strong>. We promised to build this anyway in the proposal.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>A critique of the post-it workshop as a technique for collective intelligence</strong>.\xa0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>All of this should, in my opinion, have a <em>design</em> perspective. I propose that <a class="mention" href="/u/ezio_manzini">@Ezio_Manzini</a> coordinates the activities and writes one or two papers under items 2 and 3.\xa0ER would be happy to support this.\xa0And I would love to see WeMake and ScImpulse appoint an ethnographer to look into item 1.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>', u'post_id': 6069, u'user_id': 4, u'timestamp': u'2016-12-13 17:53:30', u'title': u'Building gateways between online and offline engagement: do we have a design crisis?'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 558, u'user_id': 3503, u'timestamp': u'2016-12-13 14:15:54', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<h3>Instructions for this wiki</h3>\n\n<p>Please add your presentation(s) to the steering committee meeting of Wednesday, November 30th.

In one project taking place at the lab, members are engineering yeast to express milk proteins from non-animal sources - next generation of vegan cheeses and milk. Others are busy developing an eco-friendly bacterial sunscreen.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://openinsulin.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Open Insulin</a> is one of these projects, and its goal is to make it simpler and less expensive to make insulin, starting by investigating some novel ideas for making insulin in e. coli using fewer, easier steps than in common industrial protocols. If successful, the members hope it can be a step towards making generic production more economical, and might also enable more participation in research related to insulin, or production of the medicine at smaller scale, closer to the patients who need it, further reducing costs and giving access to more patients who lack it.</p>\n\n<p>Counter Culture Labs was founded by a group of hackers with diverse backgrounds and interests in the period from 2011 to 2012, with some members coming from <a href="https://sudoroom.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Sudo Room</a>, another hackerspace in Oakland that I participated in founding. Many were also involved in Occupy Oakland, and wanted to establish a more permanent organization with the same community spirit and values. Other members came from <a href="http://biocurious.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Biocurious</a>, another biohacking space in Sunnyvale, in the southern end of the Bay Area. I became involved both because I shared the desire to build a community-focused institution, and because I have diabetes type 1 myself, which means I live with the frustration of costly and tedious treatment regimens day in and day out, and I know how much the standard of care for diabetes patients lags behind what recent research suggests might be possible. So, for my own sake, and for the sake of the others with the condition, I sought to take whatever steps I could to close the gap between the research and what is available to patients on the market right now.</p>\n\n<p>About a year ago, some long-standing discussions around making a bioreactor to produce insulin, which had inspired a few previous attempts, turned more concrete when Isaac Yonemoto, another independent researcher of medical treatments, made <a href="http://blog.indysci.org/insulin-is-hard-but-not-impossible/" rel="nofollow noopener">some suggestions to us</a> about interesting possibilities for innovation and improvement in existing protocols. We started organising regular meetings, and out of those we then organized <a href="https://experiment.com/projects/open-insulin" rel="nofollow noopener">a successful crowdfunding campaign</a>, which then opened up connections to professionals who work on various aspects of the problem, both the science and engineering around insulin, and the questions of access to medicine. Through this it came to our attention that access to insulin lags far behind the need even now, and even in the most developed countries - costs of insulin are prohibitive even to many people in the US - and all in all, roughly 50% of those in the world who require it have no access to insulin at all, according to the <a href="http://www.100campaign.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">100 Campaign</a>, a group working on improving access to insulin around the world. There is almost no generic insulin on the American market at the moment - the first one appeared on the market about two weeks after we finished our crowdfunding campaign last year, but it is a long acting type, which is only part of the therapy required by people with diabetes type 1 (about 15-20% of diabetics in USA have type 1; the rest have type 2). And for those who use an insulin pump, short acting insulin is necessary.</p>\n\n<p>The general problem in the first world is that the incentives and interests of producers and patient communities are not aligned.</p>\n\n<p>Right now we\u2019re focused on achieving the first scientific milestones, which is to produce proinsulin, the precursor of the active form of insulin, in e. coli, in our small-scale community lab. Our lab runs mostly on donated and salvaged equipment and reagents and might be comparable in its capabilities to a lab in a less-developed area of the world where there is the least access to insulin. If we succeed, it would show the possibility that small-scale producers in remote areas might be able to make insulin to satisfy local demand, in places where centrally-manufactured supplies can\u2019t reach due to lack of infrastructure - where what roads there are, if any, do not let refrigerated trucks pass to ship needed pharmaceuticals in. Once we have a protocol that embraces everything from production to purification to near the level of purity of pharmaceutical grade insulin, we plan to approach established generics manufacturers with a case for the economic feasibility of serving the unserved market for insulin, and to partner with them to do the rest of the work of achieving sufficient purity of the product and scaling the methods to production. As we proceed with our work, the main batch of patents around the various forms of insulin are expiring, which will further help us make the case for a comprehensive portfolio of treatments to potential generics manufacturers.</p>\n\n<p>Provided all this goes well, we might then pursue another idea, closer to our original hope of a bioreactor that produces insulin, and a kind of \u2018holy grail\u2019 goal in the DIY bio world, which is a desktop biofactory, an analog of desktop 3D printers, but for proteins and biologics, which we might develop to first execute one of our protocols to produce insulin, but which we might also design with more flexibility in mind. This would consist of a bioreactor portion that could grow a culture of e. coli or yeast, and then extract and purify a product from it - very roughly speaking, the union of a fermenter with an FPLC, a piece of equipment that purifies proteins. If that is possible, supply of insulin could be placed very close to the demand of the diabetics around the world in a simple, economical package, and reliance on distribution infrastructure would be minimized. It would also reduce the need to have skilled technicians with years of lab experience to execute these protocols by hand.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, I hope that opening up the tools for research to more people can help to bring research on cures to patients, and not just treatments. Let me mention a few of the more promising ideas that have had some success in research settings. One approach is to implant functioning pancreatic cells from a donor and protect them from immune attack by various means - hard to scale if you need a constant supply of donors,but it might be possible to grow cultures of the cells in vitro to address this. Another approach is to get the immune system to cease its attack on pancreatic cells, and promote the regrowth of the body\u2019s own insulin-producing cells, either in the pancreas, or in another tissue via gene therapy - a simpler approach to apply once it is developed. Some of the ideas use very inexpensive supplies such as adjuvants, the materials in vaccines that provoke an immune response - and there has been some success using adjuvants alone, or with carefully chosen additions, to get the bodies of diabetic patients to reduce or cease their autoimmune attacks. Other concepts address the metabolic changes behind type 2 diabetes. Several drugs between the research and commercial worlds of medicine can act directly on the metabolic control mechanisms of the body, changing its pattern of energy use and other aspects of metabolism back from the pathological state of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes to the normal, healthy base state. Some of them are small organic molecules, easier to make than proteins such as insulin, but due in part to reasons of cost and incumbency, are not mainstream treatments yet.</p>\n\n<p>At the most general level, what we seek to prove is that if an order of magnitude more people get involved in research and development of science and technology, medicine can progress much faster, and might no longer be held back by institutional constraints and perverse incentives in the economics of the institutions. Right now, we\u2019re a group about half a dozen people working regularly on the project, with a few dozen more people in touch every now and then to help out, and a hundred or two in the extended community, ready to answer a question or call for help. Every week or two, someone new comes to the group, who just learned about the project via the media or our regular meetups, and wants to help. Some are complete beginners and end up taking our introductory classes to biohacking, some already have experience but got tired of the limits of the institutions where they worked, or have relatives with diabetes and want to contribute to progress. Though we\u2019re building up a broader community of participation in research slowly, we hope our efforts can plant many seeds out of which future innovations will grow.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we are looking to broaden a circle of people who can advise us, experienced scientists and engineers who can help us troubleshoot issues that inevitably come up when investigating the unknown, but we also hope to inspire other groups to work independently in a broader community of innovation. We would like to set up a network of both institutional and DIY researchers living all around the world who have different approaches and ways of making insulin as well as tackling other diabetes and health related issues. Beyond producing drugs, participants might research questions of access to medicine, investigate what patient communities need the most, look at academic publications to identify the most promising research that is not making it out to serve patients, or help establish the effort to build the desktop biofactory. Part of our goal is to prove it\u2019s possible and worthwhile for people outside institutions to take the initiative on these questions, and inspire others to take the lead in their own efforts and bring about the broader changes we seek.</p>\n\n<p>Do you have any projects in health, medicine, or biohacking that you\u2019d like to work on, but lack people, knowledge, or resources to make it happen? Are you working on a diabetes-related solution? Or do you feel like a network of care biohackers is something you\u2019d like to get involved with?

Ils ont \xe0 nouveau une Maison du Peuple!</p>\n\n<p>Ce temple architectural est \xe9videmment d\u2019abord un choix symbolique. Apr\xe8s y avoir accept\xe9 la tr\xe8s controvers\xe9e exposition Behind The Numbers glorifiant le n\xe9o-liberalisme, la Ville s\u2019est rendue compte qu\u2019il fallait donner une autre destination \xe0 cet endroit que celle de pure sp\xe9culation commerciale et d\'activit\xe9 touristique. En transformant une partie de la Bourse en Maison du Peuple elle redonne une place aux Bruxellois au c\u0153ur du centre historique!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Donnez la ville aux habitants, et tout le monde s\u2019en portera mieux</strong></p>\n\n<p>On ne comptait plus le nombre d\u2019actions contre les plans de la Ville: plates-formes citoyennes, regroupements de commer\xe7ants, actions ludiques diverses... Qui ne se souvient du banc de 30 m d\xe9pos\xe9 au milieu de la Grand place, ou des centaines de gens pique-niquant place de la Bourse, de l\'action de revendication des escaliers de la Bourse comme tribune libre d\'expression politique lors du KunstenFestivaldesarts? L\u2019espace public \xe9tait devenu un haut lieu de d\xe9bat, mais paradoxalement ne recevait pas d\u2019endroit ad\xe9quat pour le mener (une Agora). La participation ne remuait que du vent, les riverains ne se sentaient pas entendus. La ville \xe9tait taill\xe9e sur mesure pour les eurocrates, les touristes Chinois, avec commerces ouverts le dimanche, tandis que le Bruxellois devait se contenter d\u2019une ville certes prestigieuse, mais sans lieu o\xf9 il fait bon vivre, une ville d\'exp\xe9riences individuelles juxtapos\xe9es, atomis\xe9es, sans liens.</p>\n\n<p>Le Beer Tempel projet\xe9 dans le Palais de la Bourse aura une entr\xe9e par l\u2019arri\xe8re, et c\'est tr\xe8s bien ainsi. Mais sans occuper tout l\'espace, il comprendra une nouvelle Maison du Peuple, o\xf9 chacun pourrait d\xe9battre de ce qui se passe dans la ville, o\xf9 les initiatives bottom-up pourront cro\xeetre, de nouvelles id\xe9es pour une ville meilleure surgir. Il importe de faire de ce lieu symbolique qu\'est la Bourse un espace de libre d\xe9bat, une Agora. Il s\'agit de rendre la ville aux habitants pour que tout le monde en profite, pour que l\u2019habitant s\u2019y sente bien.

En revitalisant de cette fa\xe7on la Bourse, en lui donnant une \xe9chelle humaine, la Ville aide \xe0 fabriquer le tissu social des prochaines d\xe9cennies. Bien s\xfbr, le touriste y aura sa place, car la Maison du peuple sera ouverte a tous. Mais nous ne voulons pas que la centralit\xe9 habit\xe9e soit confisqu\xe9e par une vitrine \xe0 touristes. A la Maison du Peuple, les touristes pourraient rencontrer des Bruxellois, trouver des bons plans pour une visite de Bruxelles vue par ses habitants, trouver le plaisir culturel de ville plus qu\'une consommation gr\xe9gaire.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Utopie et R\xe9alit\xe9? </strong></p>\n\n<p>Et maintenant vient la chute: on est encore bien loin de cette possible utopie \xe0 Bruxelles et c\u2019est bien dommage.

And for him, his business is also personal.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere are a lot of people in my family who suffer from cardiac illness,\u201d he says referring to the recent heart-related death of his uncle. \u201cSo personally, this has affected me but above all I would say it has impassioned me, because I know personally the daily existence of people living in the village \u2026 I lived myself in a village and I know how difficult it is to get specialist care.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>According to Mr. Zang, Cameroon has only a few dozen cardiologists in a country of around 22 million people and these are clustered in urban centers like the capital, Yaounde, or the main seaport town of Douala. Roughly half of Cameroon\u2019s population lives in rural areas, according to the World Bank, while many others live in urban areas that do not have access to heart specialists.</p>\n\n<h2>Life-saving potential</h2>\n\n<p>The young engineer saw a problem and set out to try to fix it. In 2009, while still a student, Mr. Zang began developing a software product that could help doctors monitor the health of their patients\u2019 hearts. He made contact with a Yaounde-based cardiologist, Professor Samuel Kingu\xe9, who helped him better understand the type of technical solutions required. With these insights, the young engineer finally wrote a program that he loaded onto an off-the-shelf device. But he soon realized he needed the flexibility of his own platform, and so turned to developing his own hardware \u2013 the Cardiopad. \u2013 the first medical tablet in Africa, says Mr. Zang.</p>\n\n<p>The Cardiopad has a simple-to-use, touchscreen interface that is adapted to the needs of remote health workers who may lack familiarity with the latest computing devices and the know-how required to use them. In tests by the Cameroonian scientific community, the Cardiopad has proven 97.7 percent reliable. It is solidly built to withstand the humid climate and the shocks incurred while being carried over rutted, often unpaved dirt roads like the one leading to the clinic at Mbankomo. The device is also built to withstand the frequent power cuts experienced in Cameroon and across Africa. Equipped with a battery, it can run independently for around six hours at full power.</p>\n\n<p>With some 30,000 euros funding from the Cameroonian government, Mr. Zang was able to create a prototype and eventually travel to China, where he found a factory that could produce a limited run of Cardiopads while he searched around for partners to help fund his venture. Obtaining investments has been difficult. Finding the right contact in overseas companies is a challenge and the pitch is no easier. The device is designed to help Africans in rural, impoverished communities; \xa0something that not all companies see as a promising prospect, Mr. Zang says. That\u2019s why he intends to tap into a very modern financing model \u2013 crowd-funding on platforms such as Kickstarter, where users can donate funds to, or purchase shares in, fledgling firms.</p>\n\n<p>For now, he is searching for more funding, hoping to build upon the CHF 50,000 grant he received as a Rolex Award Young Laureate 2014. While funding issues have been a constraint, the pilot tablets he has been able to produce are now being tested in hospitals in Cameroon.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Zang\u2019s aim is to produce and sell his device for around 2,200 euros which is significantly cheaper than other commercially available, less portable devices. The hope is that hospitals purchasing the low-cost Cardiopad will be able to lower the price of medical examinations and speed-up medical diagnoses.</p>\n\n<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a href="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/wipo_magazine/images/2014_05_art_2_2.jpg" class="lightbox" title="2014_05_art_2_2.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt src="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/wipo_magazine/images/2014_05_art_2_2.jpg" width="690" height="632"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">2014_05_art_2_2.jpg</span><span class="informations">768x704</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div>(PHOTO: MIMORE MEDICAL)<h2>Patenting the Cardiopad</h2>\n\n<p>He also turned to the intellectual property (IP) system to help advance his work. In December 2011, he applied for a patent via the Organisation Africaine de la Propri\xe9t\xe9 Intellectuelle (OAPI) in Yaounde [<a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2014/05/article_0002.html#oapi" rel="nofollow noopener">see box</a>]. OAPI later granted him a patent (No. 16213) on his technology, covering some aspects of both the software and the hardware.</p>\n\n<p>Obtaining a patent was an important step for Mr. Zang. \u201cI did it to reassure myself,\u201d he said, \u201calso to protect the product, and to have a lot more credibility in the eyes of, for example, partners with whom I wanted to sign contracts in order to be able to produce and then sell the product.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When funds permit, he also plans to register the Cardiopad, and his company, Himore Medical, which currently produces the tablet, as trademarks.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe intellectual property system can help us in Africa \u2013 it can add credibility to African products. And credibility has repercussions on the business plan because if you aren\u2019t credible, it\u2019s difficult to sell your product,\u201d says Mr. Zang.</p>\n\n<h2>Driving new developments</h2>\n\n<p>The budding entrepreneur is already in collaboration with other young Cameroonian engineers to develop a range of additional medical devices and technologies for rural areas. He points to what he views as a disconnect in the innovation environment in Cameroon: in the medical space, in particular, many of the creators and inventors are young like him \u2013 roughly half of Cameroon\u2019s population is under the age of 18 \u2013 so they rarely suffer from the diseases that products like the Cardiopad are designed to address.</p>\n\n<p>Further, with a rapidly urbanizing population, urban dwellers may all too easily overlook the specific needs of those living in remote rural areas. For Mr. Zang, innovation requires a flexible mindset, a deep understanding of an entire economic ecosystem and an ability to commercialize ideas.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t only have engineering ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to go further, into researching the problems confronting Africans and then pursue research into solutions, subsidize the creation of companies, create business incubators that can help nurture projects, researchers, engineers and really help them move from the laboratory to the factory.\u201d</p>\n\n<h2>Pursuing a dream</h2>\n\n<p>Ultimately, Mr. Zang\u2019s dream is to continue working to \u201cimprove life conditions\u201d by branching out into other areas of medical technology, envisioning specially adapted devices for echography and radiology.</p>\n\n<p>In the Mbankomo clinic, the lack of these higher-end materials is evident. Surrounded by a tidy plot of well-brushed soil dotted with shade trees, the one-story clinic is austere. Patient consulting rooms are cooled by open windows, but little advanced machinery is on display. Mr. Zang says doctors at the facility are overwhelmed by the health needs of patients, which range from the mundane to the mortal. Connecting these clinics to better-resourced hospitals elsewhere via the mobile phone system is establishing a lifeline.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Zang hopes ultimately to manufacture the Cardiopad in Cameroon, and to help the country develop as a manufacturing center for lower-cost devices specifically tailored to low-resource environments and markets, like those in West Africa.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis will help lower the cost of medical exams and the cost of good health across the regions, in the villages,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s the dream that is smoldering in me.\u201d</p>', u'post_id': 555, u'user_id': 3279, u'timestamp': u'2016-11-30 10:45:21', u'title': u'Cardiopad: Reaching the Hearts of Rural Communities in Africa'}, {u'content': u'<p><a href="http://www.aae.ie/" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>An \xc1it Eile</span></a><span>\xa0in Galway, Ireland would like to invite you to a workshop on Monday the 5th of December from 2-5.15pm in conjunction with </span><a href="/en"><span>Edgeryders</span></a><span>, at </span><a href="http://www.bbec.ie/" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>Ballybane Enterprise Centre</span></a><span>.

I have been wondering about new approaches to care and this question has been much in my mind since interviewing members of the public during a project about the \u201cword on the street\u201d in Liverpool in 2015. It was a sobering month in which I came to know personally\xa0just how disaffected and disenfranchised the public felt about anything changing for the better in England.\xa0 In a <a href="/t/notes-from-community-call-on-emotional-health-and-possibly-inappropropriate-conversation/5625/4">comment</a> on the Edgeryders community call on improving\xa0how we support each others mental and spiritual health, I wondered if \u201ceveryone who lives in a distributed area is in some way involved in processing the emotions experienced in that place\u201d. I feel a great potential for technological networks to create rituals and bring people together to process experiences in new\xa0ways. Generally, I\'m talking about creative\xa0networks for coming back to life: networks that invite people into a social experience to care about themselves and other people, to keep hold of their hopes, to understand beyond their own spheres of experience and to find\xa0support\xa0in being\xa0the magician of their own life. This is speculative stuff, I realise, so I\u2019ll\xa0anchor my offering to this strand in real examples and share work that I know of and am making.</p>\n\n<p>A frank admission to start: the subject of networks of care is relatively new terrain for me. I\u2019m no expert and there are long histories and contexts that I cannot represent here.\xa0 I really welcome feedback, criticism, references and most of all, examples of working networks already in place. There are many excellent examples and the diversity of reports shared on this site - the variety of food sharing initiatives, performance and storytelling circles, maker spaces and innovative support systems\xa0- is informing\xa0my learning around\xa0this subject.</p>\n\n<p>One of the areas that show most clearly the positive effects that community interventions can have are post-conflict efforts. In this post, I want to tell you about the powerful work of theTrust for Indigenous Culture and Health (TICAH) who developed a program with survivors of the Nyayo House Torture Centre and other centres in Kenya. In a follow up piece I will look more at digital systems with a mind to exploring how elements of ritual and and formalised events for expression and listening might be tapped into in new ways to support communities through online means.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><b>Facilitating Forgiveness: the hardest job there is?</b></p>\n\n<p>I met Denis Ngala when I was doing some work in Timbavati, South Africa. He is a tall, radiant and infectiously joyful character, utterly grounded and with a sense of spiritual authority having spent most of his twenties studying in a seminary. He told me a lot about the work that he was doing in Kenya with <a href="http://ticahealth.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">TICAH</a> and the problems that faced victims of torture returning to society after they had been released.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Details of the intense suffering and the physical and mental abuse that went on in Nairobi\u2019s Nyayo House torture chambers and other places of detention during President Moi\u2019s regime are still emerging decades later. Ngala was working at facilitating meals for torture victims and their perpetrators where they could have honest discussions in an attempt to heal these old wounds. He told me that often the victims and perpetrators of the violence were people who grew up in the same village and had studied at neighbouring schools so he was often bringing together people who had known each other throughout their lives. The kind of emotional resolve and resources needed for either survivor or perpetrator to face the horror of the past and sit down together, share food and listen to each other\u2019s stories is frankly extraordinary. But Ngala describes his methodology when convening these meetings as based on simplicity: \u201cit is rooted in listening to one another and honouring each life story.\u201d His role as the third party, guiding the conversation, ensuring that each person spoke and was listened to has had truly beneficial effects. He tells me that some who have gone through the process visit each other and share their childhood stories or are able to meet at public occasions.</p>\n\n<p>One very illuminating aspect of this work is that the focus goes beyond the individuals directly involved. TICAH has looked to help educate the wider community to understand what had happened and how to support it. This was necessary as without\xa0 intervention communities often closed up, and rather than accepting the survivor back into social contact they viewed the returning survivor with unease and distrust, creating a situation in which survivors sometimes found themselves ostracised, left to deal with the experience alone.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>TICAH met this situation with interventions that emphasised embodied communication and the creative body. They invited those effected to walk a labyrinth together in a peace ceremony and organised body map workshops that brought together different survivors to share their stories. The body-mapping workshops use art skills to trace participants\u2019 bodies and then map elements of their life stories onto this body map: visual elements are added that stand for the individual\u2019s aims, what supports them, the traumas they have lived through and their strengths. These visual records are a way of introducing the details of what happened in captivity back into the community to be held by everyone. So the labyrinth walking and the body-mapping make the real lives, bodies and experiences of the victims a public experience and enable the wider community to listen to and appreciate how these survivors managed to live through painful and unbelievably challenging times.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><b>The Human Element</b></p>\n\n<p>This is incredible work - through these interventions TICAH help communicate that the process of recovery is not the problem of the victim of torture alone, but is in a very real sense owned by the whole community. One striking aspect is the emphasis on accepting the seriousness of the situation - dealing with the very worst of what humans can do to each other - with vital, dramatic, expressive interactive meetings. The labyrinth walking is profoundly beautiful group ritual and the body mapping opens up the assembled individuals to listen to the challenges that others have lived through, and it does this in a joyful and creative way. Reconciliation over food feels innately right. The activities though almost timeless in their simplicity are unusual and unexpected, and generally unlike anything that any of the participants have done before. The act of doing something new is particularly suited to transforming problems as there are no painful memories attached; it opens up new horizons and is perhaps more likely to lead to a renewed present.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>When I ask Ngala what networked technologies could do to help these efforts he replies that they could help facilitate expression: \u201cIn this work there are problems, most of them could be solved through sharing. When survivors are given opportunities to share their stories they heal fast. Networks would provide a good platform for people to share their experiences. Sharing could be done through writing or be spoken. Narrations could be recorded and later could be used to make short clips.\u201d I think of just how possible this is as it is poses a clear and actionable technological problem, but looking at Ngala I wonder whether he realises how key his presence is to the process and the quality of the interaction. What forges the profound shifts in people\u2019s experience is how their expression is received, listened to, validated and responded to. When speaking with Ngala, a man with vast generosity of soul and focused attention, you really do feel stronger. He beams at you and honours your presence in a way that is rare. In conversation with him you feel that your words matter, your life is respected and that miraculous healing is possible. Popular culture tends to talk about purging emotions, as if emotions are toxic material that needs ejecting from your system, but what Ngala\u2019s work shows is that the magic is in the courage to speak honestly and the grace of being heard: that\u2019s when emotions turn into understanding. The human catalysts at TICAH are so much a part of why these reconciliation attempts have been successful and any attempt to extend the work through technology needs to factor this in at the centre.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Simplicity of invitation, creative expression, embodied shared experience, working and listening to others, ritual time and focus, the unexpected, all these feel like good leads for designing a transformative care network. TICAH\u2019s emphasis on shared humanity and that each person is a human being with a different story encourages survivors and perpetrators alike to stand strong in themselves, to understand the past and live a better day.\xa0 I think of post-conflict creative efforts like<a href="http://reflections.org.np/" rel="nofollow noopener"> </a><a href="http://reflections.org.np/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://reflections.org.np/</a> that creatively depict the subjectivities of Nepali people in the aftermath of the earthquake. There is a courage in projects that present every person, even though they may have lived through horrendous circumstances, as a human being with a unique story and power.</p>\n\n<p><b>Digital Networks for Creative Care</b></p>\n\n<p>Strong mutual care is essential not only in places seeking to recover from atrocities, but generally for\xa0people working together and sharing space, especially if they are "living on the edge". Change is difficult and every group\xa0liable to conflict. E.C. Whitmont writes in The Symbolic Quest that \u201cThe seeming inevitability of conflict among the archetypal "powers" can cause us to experience life as a hopeless, senseless impasse. But the conflict can also be discovered to be the expression of a symbolic pattern still to be intuited.\u201d There\'s a potential that we can reach into the intuitions that come out of difficult experience and grow understanding of group dynamics to create pathways that do not end in violence, abuse and waste. The sad cases of suicide, sabotage, ill health and conflict that we know of in digital tech, startup and hacker cultures show that forging wisdom in this area is important.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I\xa0feel the\xa0need for strange networks of care:\xa0unusual, compelling networks that don\u2019t attempt to fix anyone but make healing and self-understanding an adventure and help individuals back into the simple joys of communion and creativity. To\xa0explore\xa0group dynamics and coherence in\xa0recent projects I\u2019ve been involved in, I\'ve worked with beans <a href="http://www.rootbeans.com/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://www.rootbeans.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rootbeans.com/</a>, with dreams (following the method of my mentor Apela Colorado) <a href="http://oneiricarchives.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://oneiricarchives.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://oneiricarchives.tumblr.com/</a>\xa0and with storytelling <a href="http://www.thehaguecenter.org/pathways-project-2/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://www.thehaguecenter.org/pathways-project-2/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.thehaguecenter.org/pathways-project-2/</a>. \xa0Back up in Liverpool we\'re improvising on Stafford Beer\'s work on group dynamics in public meetings. Whether it\u2019s VR group therapy where you experience your own body and other people in highly unusual ways or group Skype rituals for reconciliation the whole notion of care networks is wide open for innovation and renewal.\xa0As a guiding design point I think the only answer to questions like how can ritual time be held online or how can digital networks provide the intensity of feedback of live interaction is <i>bold creativity</i>. If you have examples of\xa0creative online\xa0systems to faciliate group communication and support\xa0that go beyond a\xa0message board or online forum and become something more vital and "live" please share them.\xa0 I\u2019ll be at <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow noopener">33C3</a> if there\u2019s people from the Edgeryders community who want to meet around the\xa0theme of hacking\xa0strange networks of care. There\u2019s also an option to organise a session: <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Static:Self-organized_Sessions" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Static:Self-organized_Sessions" rel="nofollow noopener">https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Static:Self-organized_Sessions</a>\xa0</p>\n\n<p><b>Learning in Doing\xa0</b></p>\n\n<p>There is a huge amount of trauma recovery material and contexts for group psychology that I do not know about. It is challenging terrain. As much as it\u2019s essential to tread carefully, it is also necessary to create. The outpouring of emotional pain, anger and concern after the American election makes clear a need for strong communities of action and bold ways for participating in new stories. As worrying as is the prospect of making mistakes around mental health, the more worrying prospect is not creating networks to meaningfully connect up alienated, isolated or suffering individuals. Local actions, online networks and communities are all growing this November: each network has a different focus. Involving digital technology to reimagine group psychology and care (beyond Facebook) is just one of the potentials to help these evolving networks support themselves.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Ngala\u2019s experience shows that targeted and bold ventures can reboot the community\u2019s ability to support\xa0and that there is the possiblity of even the\xa0most horrific of violations\xa0healing. The greatest thing that I learnt from Ngala is the scale of his belief. When I ask him what has been the most illuminating discovery about human care through facilitating this work he replies: \u201cThe most amazing thing is we are all human who heal despite all the experiences we have met in life\u201d.\xa0 His belief is born out by his experience. It is vital not to miss the transformative quality of having one person believe in another. I consider the enormous amount of work and transformation needed in the decades ahead to meet the problems of our time and then I think about three human beings sitting down for a meal in Kenya and have the sense that great tasks are possible if we learn to work together.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Links on article:\xa0</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://ticahealth.org/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://ticahealth.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://ticahealth.org/</a>\xa0</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.ticahealth.org/files/TICAH-nyayo-house-torture-body-maps.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://www.ticahealth.org/files/TICAH-nyayo-house-torture-body-maps.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ticahealth.org/files/TICAH-nyayo-house-torture-body-maps.pdf</a>Interview with TICAH\u2019s founder Mary Ann Burris\xa0with details on body mapping:\xa0<a href="http://practicalmattersjournal.org/2011/03/01/burris-interview/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://practicalmattersjournal.org/2011/03/01/burris-interview/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://practicalmattersjournal.org/2011/03/01/burris-interview/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TICAH_KE" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="https://twitter.com/TICAH_KE" rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/TICAH_KE</a></p>\n\n<p>Photo:\xa0<a href="https://twitter.com/Engalas" rel="nofollow noopener">Denis Ngala</a>\xa0in South Africa\xa0</p>\n\n<p><i>The production of this\xa0article was supported by\xa0<a href="/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296">Op3n\xa0Fellowships</a>\xa0-\xa0an ongoing program for community contributors\xa0during May - November 2016.</i></p>', u'post_id': 553, u'user_id': 2754, u'timestamp': u'2016-11-21 15:42:40', u'title': u'Vital Networks: the work of transforming experience into understanding'}, {u'content': u'<h2>Table of contents</h2><ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li><a href="#tactics">Legal tactics</a></li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li><a href="#logic">Logic of this document</a></li>\n\n</ul><h2>\n\n</h2><p><a name="tactics"></a>Legal tactics</p>\n\n<h3>Don\'t incorporate</h3>\n\n<p>If you are not a legal entity, you are obviously exempt from any authorization regime, bureaucracy requirements etc. Your scope for action is limited only by the freedom of individuals in your legal system.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>On the downside, unincorporated initiatives cannot easily use some of the services that legal entity can.

With several people in town we hosted a community dinner as a way to take action against something happening every day under our noses - massive good food throwaway. By households, restaurants, markets and especially supermarkets, by you, by your family, by your neighbor, by me. We collected food close to being dumped and got people to cook together and share a meal while interacting heavily around the issue.</p>\n\n<p>I won\u2019t ramble about why it\u2019s important we pay more attention to food overall - from where and how far it comes from, the cost of having nicely chopped avocados on a restaurant plate, to how we pick stuff off the supermarket shelves and never wonder where the brown bananas are going, to how we realize our canned peas are overdue after having been hidden in overstuffed fridges or pantries (it\u2019s a <a href="https://green.harvard.edu/tools-resources/video/expired-food-waste-america">trap</a>!).

I\u2019m one of them and I think as a group we can do better. We\u2019re well positioned to use a tiny bit of our time doing something other than work, other than expensive hobbies, other than just consuming.

Christian.\xa0In the same novel: talking about a group of young people, call them silf (Fedayeen): their mission is receiving torture instead of the elderly and sick people and those who lost and those who lost their endurance, can you imagine that the (Fidayeen) were singing under torture: "O prison darkness come, we love darkness, inevitably after this long night daybreak is coming"</p>\n\n<p>By the way altruism is still there and it is main reason why the Syrians in Syria are still alive.</p>\n\n<p>Social solidarity is in its worst conditions in this war but still can feed the hungry and keeps warm to those who are cold. For example the project of "grace conversation"\xa0in Damascus which provides medicine for thousands of families from excess medication at other families, and also "maoayed alrahman"\xa0which are food tables spent by the Syrians with very high annual cost ( 50 million dollars) in 2014 through all the cities.\xa0In addition to internal displacement thousands of families are participating with their\xa0homes and food and many other live examples.</p>\n\n<p>The shape of our lives makes us one body: we know our relatives, enjoy their joys, get sad for their sadness. The satisfaction of our grandparents is as important as our parents.</p>\n\n<p>The poor celebrate double in our holidays because of a race for\xa0goodness, because the concept of "Eid"\xa0in the perception of Islam linked to "Zakat"\xa0which is basically the process of cleansing the money by giving the poor his legitimate right of the money which is 2,5 percent of annual profits in secret.\xa0If there is no secrecy Allah does not accept it .</p>\n\n<p>And many annual grants to the poor some of it linked to time, and some linked to personal events like "Akika"\xa0which is slaughtering two\xa0rams\xa0and distributing them\xa0to the poor when the child is born.</p>\n\n<p>Of course every rule has exception but the united community can overcome it.</p>\n\n<p>Every citizen has moral responsibilities and he is already indebted to the community.</p>\n\n<p>There is no perfection of course, being in Europe allows me to discover the value of freedom, human value, accept differences, respect the personal space, working hard. To be precise I have to admit that the western civilization is the mirror which we see the deterioration of our situation through it, and the image we want to be closer to.</p>\n\n<p>The respect for the human person, the system of rights and duties, which I respected from the first day. But living in the middle east gives you the chance to see the dark face of that world, the military training field I came from taught me to not believe the existing models, the part of relations of states specifically.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m talking here about the weapons/arms markets, and other markets based on the dead bodies of other states. Especially after watching the news talking about Aleppo, Mosul \u2026 etc Cheap games to prolong the war, unlimited support for the parties of the conflict, in exchange for contracts and concessions we will know in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Transforming the world into struggles areas to gain wealth, and safe areas to enjoy the wealth.</p>\n\n<p>Religion also had a lion\u2019s share in the misuse and legitimization of wars has nothing to do with religion and history is full of examples. The equation of religion and ignorance had a devastating impact through history and nowadays it is very clear that faith without understanding is more dangerous than earthquakes, with corrupt regimes support hate speech that all you need to have new Libya, and with governments are the direct enemy to their citizens you will have Syria or Iraq if you are lucky , and in order to not equate the killer with the victim, I blame the governments for expanding the circle of ignorance, and put the platforms in the service of semiconductor scientists and intellectuals.</p>\n\n<p>Under these conditions the best thing you can get to is the Egyptian model, with hungry ignorant people afraid to be like those in Syria or Iraq, governed by fascist goverments.</p>\n\n<p>But I believe in the communion of civilizations.</p>\n\n<p>The ashes of war go away by time, and civilization remains.</p>\n\n<p>For some reason we live short lives, nobody knows the reason more than you, nobody can tell you what is the ideal way of thinking, but for sure at least in the civilized world we can be like ants villages, be single hand for the good of future generations, to get a world does not force you to be a refugee, a world where mankind life in the first consideration, morality and intelligence to regulate relations.</p>\n\n<p>My message to the reader:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Keep reading</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>No one has a monopoly on truth, it is somewhere in the middle, I don\u2019t have it, but I have part of it, we complete each other, you and me are pieces of the puzzle.

Which sounds great, but seriously, what the heck does that even mean?</p>\n\n<p>Minerva is a new university that aims to reimagine the paradigm of higher education, based on the science of learning. All classes are seminars, with a flipped classroom structure. Meaning that we students, learn the content on our own and spend time engaging with the deeper concepts behind the material. Moving the emphasis away from the professor teaching and instead towards students learning.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is facilitated by Minerva\u2019s online platform where all classes take place. Every student (no more than 20 per class) webcams into class, where the platform allows our professors to more easily check how much everyone is participating in the discussion, send us into breakout groups, and live poll the class. Beyond being of instructional benefit, the online format takes away much of the typical costs of facilities development and maintenance that traditional universities place upon their students. Additionally, it allows Minerva to be a genuinely international experience. Our student body is comprised of students from over 40 countries. We live and travel together to seven cities (in as many countries) in cohorts no greater than 150 students. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>This unique structure has brought together an amazing community, with potential for changing many of the ways we view higher education. However, there is one factor of higher education that I work most with, and that is students\u2019 mental health and wellness! Minerva students\u2019 have necessarily high work loads, a variety of cultures and constantly transitioning lifestyles, which makes it the perfect edge case to gain insights on how to improve mental health care in universities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility of Resources:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the U.S., a 2014 study found that the average ratio of university mental health professionals to students is about 1:2080. This means that students in need of counseling services face long wait lists and a low amount sessions, resulting in care that is often literally too little too late.</p>\n\n<p>This has a simple fix: dedicate resources so that students who seek help can get it! The real challenge comes in getting students to value their own well being and to reach out when they feel they need mental support. 80% of students who commit suicide (the second leading cause of university student death) never come into contact with any staff from the counseling center. How do we address these issues?</p>\n\n<p><strong>The answer is Cultivating Care through Community!</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is where my work comes in. As a student working on the school\u2019s mental health team I get work on changes that try and address mental health before it becomes an impediment to education. Currently, I am working on a training for students to learn how to better manage their self care and stress management. Additionally, we are adapting trainings from other universities to include aspects from the science of learning, and create a more lasting impact. A prime example of this is the Student Support Network Training (originally developed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute), where students are nominated by their peers to learn how to better understand their own mental health, as well as support friends by caring for them in crisis and connecting to the resource they need.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, it\u2019s no longer enough to focus solely on the counseling department\u2019s efforts to improve students wellness. Our academic team offers periodic sessions with deans and professors to help students improve their writing, time management and other skills that can lead to increased stressed when not appropriately addressed.</p>\n\n<p>The Student Experience Team has created a series of traditions that brings the student body together as well, to fight the isolation that can commonly occur when students transition into college. Every monday evening a different student takes a leap of faith and give their \u201cMinerva Talk\u201d, by sharing the story of their life so far. On Wednesdays students gather in small groups for Supper Clubs where they all bring some food to share as they explore questions that push them to be vulnerable.</p>\n\n<p>While we still working on figuring out a lot of how we address student well being (and build this university) it\u2019s become clear that the future of student care must be holistic and not just reactive.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts and also what you are working on!

And how come that trauma - such a heavy word, such a serious matter - is your passion?\' That is what people ask me when they hear about <a href="/t/trauma-tour/707">my tour,</a> about me and my bus traveling through Europe to talk and teach about trauma and to try to soften the pain of trauma. \'No, I am not on a mission (that is a far too \'religious word for me to befriend with) - and yes, trauma is my passion, and I do have a message.</p>\n\n<p>I really believe that pain should come in the open. That it should be de-tabooed: we should know more about it, understand better what traumatic pain is, how it functions, how it takes possession of us, we should be able to look at it more closely, to be with it (for a while). Trauma, pain, fear ... we\'d rather not experience it or watch it happen in someone else\'s life. It is like with \'death\': we know it is part of our lives, we all have to deal with it, and yet we don\'t - because it\'s (too) uncomfortable. How to talk about human mistreatments, heavy physical pain, profound disrespect of your person, or situations where you felt like if your life was in danger? How to share the feelings of loneliness and hopelessness that go with such pain? We often do not know how to do that, and try to ban painful events and feelings from our minds, we want to forget about it.</p>\n\n<p>It is something in pain itself too. We\'re hardwired to avoid and suppress pain. It helps us survive, it helps us to go on. Avoiding, minimizing and denying pain is our most natural, short term solution to deal with pain. It is a survival mechanism. It often takes a while, from seconds to minutes, to physically feel the pain caused by an accident, a car crash or a broken leg. Not feeling the pain gives us more time to save ourselves, to get away from danger. \xa0Out of the car, walk away and call the ambulance f.ex. On the long term, however, not feeling isn\u2019t very effective. Because it is impossible to heal from something we don\'t acknowledge. On the long term, suppressed pain comes back to us, like a boomerang. That is what trauma and traumatic pain is about: it is pain that doesn\'t seems to go away, pain that stays with us far too long, as a residue of what happened to us.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that this residual pain needs to be addressed more openly. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>Traumatic pain can be softened - and it should be. Because unresolved trauma makes us sick, depressed and heavy-hearted. It deregulates us, deeply and on many levels: mind, heart and body. We know that traumatic pain lies at the heart of most contemporary diseases, be they mental or physical, we know that trauma adds to almost every sickness as a major contributing factor. And yet ... the knowledge about trauma and how to address it to lower its dramatic impact on our lives is far from common.</p>\n\n<p>That is what my tour is about: I want the world to be trauma-informed.</p>\n\n<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/184185350" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" title="Bus all of it" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe>\n\n<p>I want people to come and look at the pictures on the bus and ask questions.

We can all learn to help traumatized persons recover. It often takes not more than 15 minutes to help people sleep better: help them release tension before they go to bed, by offering a relaxing breathing exercise, or teach them to intervene in their dreams by using their imagination, by rehearsing a different ending for their nightmare f.ex.</p>\n\n<p>We are all on a mission: to a certain degree we all need to become trauma specialists. First, we need to deal with our own trauma\'s and those of the people around us. We need to dare to feel and face our pain instead of running away from it. Second, there\'s too much suffering in the world as to leave its resolution to the clinical field or therapeutic setting. Therapeutic knowledge should be accessible to all of us, it should not be protected and copyrighted. Therapeutic knowledge should be alive in the world, not only in shrinks\u2019 offices. That is why I do what I do: share my knowledge about trauma with you, share insights, methods and techniques from the field of trauma healing ... so that we can all, together, ease and soften the pain in our world. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know of any other projects sharing therapeutic knowledge in the way <a href="http://www.traumatour.eu" rel="nofollow noopener">Trauma Tour</a> does. But the idea of a trauma-informed world is related to a growing field of \u2018self care\u2019: taking responsibility for one\'s own (mental) health by reading self help books, attending self help groups, becoming experience experts, \u2026 It is long known that helping on this \u2018equal\u2019 level, is often more effective than any method or technique. It is also known that the relationship between \u2018therapist\u2019 and \u2018patient\u2019 is a major factor when it comes to healing. If we combine both, \u2018helping expertise\u2019 and \u2018being equal\u2019, it seems a very natural thing to come out of our offices and share therapeutic knowledge with those who suffer. It makes \u2018us\u2019 helpers and \u2018them\u2019 traumatized people equal human beings, fellow human beings. It restores humanity.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m now in the middle of planning my first big tour: driving down the Balkan route and visit Greece in December 2016 / January 2017.

Making young people relevant, inviting them to our social life, giving them a frame to belong in a European future is the necessary counterbalance for our aging and shrinking population.</p>\n\n<p>The rate of cultural change linked to technology has been constantly increasing and initiatives to educate our people must overcome institutional slowing down, if our societies are to participate significantly in the future.</p>\n\n<h3>Education, learning &amp; the value of teenagers</h3>\n\n<p>Traditional educational systems are failing to take social changes into account. The inertia of national states behind educational institutions is failing to answer to the reality of communities that are experiencing social change at a faster than ever rate. The future we imagine cannot be reached following old pathways.</p>\n\n<p>Teenagers are left out of social life, with no appropriate spaces or other activities expected from them, apart from attending compulsory school until an age that keeps rising as the human life cycle prospers. In a phase of life characterized by passion and vocation, loads of energy and bluntness, teenagers in Europe find themselves institutionalized and irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>\xabFuture Tools\xbb project is an acknowledgment of the value teenagers have for society: they hold our future in their hands. \xabFuture Tools\xbb is a space designed with caring attention to fit the needs of our young generation, aiming to connect them to a new world of opportunities by inviting them to work, to collaborate, to participate and to have a voice in their own community. We can now apply our knowledge about adolescence to provide a comprehensive environment in which teenagers can develop healthy social emotions, autonomous and egalitarian participation.</p>\n\n<p>Provide an alternative to corporate uses of technology through the culture of the commons; spread collaborative habits in neighborhoods; build activities rooted in intrinsic motivation that bloom in communal benefit are some of the ways \xabFuture Tools\xbb will engage people in fostering a society with greater equality, solidarity and sustainability.</p>\n\n<p>\xabFuture Tools\xbb is a common learning lab for teenagers. By offering youngster a place to gather and pursue their interests while promoting their autonomy, we aim to empower them to work for a better future. Sharing resources and interests in an alternative learning space, the culture of collaboration and the democratizing possibilities of technology, this place will have its roots in the neighborhood\u2019s daily activities and funnel the parents\u2019 interest in social promotion for their kids towards a more inclusive society.</p>\n\n<p>The abundance of open resources that can be freely accessed through personal learning environments to learn digital skills \u2014such as computational thinking, governance software, UX design, in fact any skills that we may need to implement our projects in the world\u2014 is an opportunity, never known before to such a widespread extent, to empower our youngsters to build a better future.</p>\n\n<h3>Neighboring environment</h3>\n\n<p>The neighborhood as a community comes to relevance in the task of \xabhelping grow adults\xbb. The age group that most closely matches the Secondary Education stage in our culture has in the neighborhood its spatial range of freedom, just one step away from the wide world they will live in as adults. Connecting these neighboring communities to the global emergence of the digital culture as makers and participants through their own teenagers is a pertinent, strengthening link between local and broader communities.</p>\n\n<p>It is urgent for these generations of parents and offspring to leap forward over institutional stagnancy and give ourselves the shared resources we can provide for our own borough, in every neighborhood, nurturing our tribe-prone teens from the gang to the team, by building around them the common ground for community.</p>\n\n<p>It is sometimes sad hear stating that what is being promoted for innovation in the field of education \u2014on the basis of empathic personal exchange, attention to the tempo, sensibility for intrinsic motivations, in short: the wisdom of caring for each other\u2014 are outdated methodologies. Digital tools offers a new breeze to these methodologies, an opportunity to enhance the soft aspects of learning and allow us to cast aside production-line techniques when it comes to our kids: lecturing, memorizing, exams, ringing bell schedules, curriculums and subjects. We can now afford those luxuries our industrialized schools didn't plan for and, dragged by institutional inertia, won't anytime soon.</p>", u'post_id': 796, u'user_id': 3468, u'timestamp': u'2016-10-27 09:29:22', u'title': u'Future tools'}, {u'content': u'<h2><strong>Alzheimer\u2019s Wristband &lt;3</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Idea is about helping the families of the patients who have alzheimer\'s at last stage.

This big Island to the right of \xa0Africa hosts20 million people, the majority still living under \xa01 \xa3 a day. They have a lot of opportunities which still need to be explored. And those opportunities are in the hand of the future generations who need some rejuvenation.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Malagasy parents used to tell stories and legends to give wisdom, advice and knowledge to their children. When there were some schools appearing they thought that a story is not enough to raise their own child. Wisdom came before knowledge for Malagasy people. As Malagasy are saying "Let your behavior be like a tree: if the roots are strong enough, leaves can shake as they want." \xa0Parents decided to send children to school and encourage them to go further as long as they can support them. In fact having a son or daughter graduate from University is an honor for parents and children, it means that both are successful. In that time, to accept a job opportunity easily, leaving the familial cid and flying with their own wings is easier.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, child education is a must until the 6th grade, to be exact. Knowing how to count, writing one\u2019s name or read, that\'s enough in some suburban places. Somewhere in the South of Madagascar kids have to travel 3 hours through village or dunes. Sometimes walking 15 km from school and going back and forth, sometimes students get a half day of school. There has never been a bus school or transport, and even if students get a student car they don\'t get reduction.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>It\'s happened that teachers don\'t get paid for three months, become lazy and don\'t teach classes. Sometime parents and someone in charge on school find a solution, telling parents to give some amount of money or telling his child to bring some rice for the canteen. In small villages school is far, college and high school is even farther, University is more in the province.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>It\'s happened also that parents are less educated and don\'t know how to guide the child, in fact the essential for the children is to manage their own life insurance.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Graduating from University doesn\'t make sense anymore for young people.\xa0</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a young Malagasy person I know where we have been, but I don\'t know where are going...\xa0</p>\n\n<p>After finishing your studies you need to line up behind millions of jobless for a job opportunity. \xa0After investigation ; Many those young people\xa0struggle and move on the street working as a "taxi phone" mobile cheap call, bus driver, gold digger... any available job in general. Some get influenced by easy money called "bizna":\xa0it means selling anything, from a friend or relative, like cell phones, computers, tyres, cars.\xa0Those who have funds to run their business can invest into something short term or permanent like restaurants, jewelry, imports etc.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about it: 67 % of Malagasy people are about 15 to 25 years young. \xa0Statistically 15 % of graduates get an exact job for the position that they prepared for in University, 65% remain jobless and 10 % know someone high placed and get to work for an unsuitable job and that they don\'t have any idea what it is about or how to do; about the last 5% have something \xa0planned for, and finally the 5% remaining help \xa0parents at home. Many foreign companies like to employ people from Sri Lanka or Indonesia because they are more skilled and less corrupted... We have more and more foreigners who are coming here to get rich. It\'s also another gate for economy and illnesses from both sides.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>There are some good things in progress.\xa0Recently I met some people from Christian missionary\xa0called ADRA "Adventist Development and Relief Agency" \xa0using techniques to improve farming for those who have land or what to farming it was only a campaign. NGOs like USAID who have been here since 32 years to help Malagasy people to realize goals of development, recover from natural disaster like cyclones, health care like malnutrition, sponsoring on project used to be only for educational like "youth and reproduction", \xa0"Youth against HIV". But it\'s only in the capital or on a regional campaign for few times and not long enough to be remembered by people. They are trying to give free training, help and support for young people in suburban areas but ... sometime with no success . Youth Volunteers like Peacecorps almost every year whose giving free teaching, help and give some supplies like pen and copy book, chalkboard \xa0etc.. if they have something to give.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>All those things are looking good for a while, but they have no impact on their lifetime. There is no precise political with systematization or screening. There is not enough community who cares especially for young Malagasy. Insecurity, infrastructure and corruption are principal factors which still exist since long time and drag in deep water the majority of those young people. When I was asking them to give their thoughts, they say: " We felt abandoned by the government, they only thinking about how to full they pockets. As we learned from school: "I" is going first and "YOU" is after, that\u2019s how people in government are thinking. Our daily duty is to wake-up, go outside chilling with friends, and go back home at lunch time\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Malagasy people cannot lean on their own government, it doesn\u2019t have enough budget to overcome this or: the budget is going somewhere else which is more important, like towards health. Private school is plenty even if some of them don\'t have the right character as a normal school: no playing ground, no gates... Parents like it because the teaching method is quite modern and up to date, teachers are quite professional. \xa0Some of those private schools belong to someone on the Government. The good thing is that teachers in private schools are at least able to do their job smoothly and actually finish school programs.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Malagasy people still believe that education is the best legacy.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do you find ways to make a living as a young generation which government does not care for ? </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Please go\xa0ahead, ask questions and add your comments :)</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>The production of this\xa0article was supported by\xa0<a href="/opencarefellowships">Op3n\xa0Fellowships</a>\xa0-\xa0an ongoing program for community contributors\xa0during May - November 2016.</em></p>', u'post_id': 746, u'user_id': 3340, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-17 20:27:51', u'title': u'How do you find ways to make a living as a young generation which government does not care for?'}, {u'content': u'<p>"<a href="http://podziemnepanstwokobiet.blogspot.be/">Podziemne Pa\u0144stwo Kobiet</a>" is both a documentary and a collection of abortion stories from Polish women who had illegal abortions in the past two decades. Poland most likely is the only country in the world that had abortions legal by law (1956-1993) and changed it "backward".\xa0We ended up having <a href="http://worldabortionlaws.com">one of the most restrictive laws in the world</a>, and the legislators were smart, by\xa0avoiding criminalizing women (with whom society would sympathize) and focusing instead on everyone else who assists with abortions (the penalties are up to 8 years in prison), creating a system of fear and paranoia.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The first thing that strikes\xa0about abortion in Poland is the statistics - according to Polish Ministry of Health in 2013, there were 744 legal abortions and 718 of them due to the risk of birth defects. 3 of them due to rape and 23 due to the risk posed to women health. In 2015 there were 1044 legal abortions. For a country with 38 million inhabitants, these numbers seem just wrong. In Spain or UK, these numbers are 200 or 400 times higher. And it\'s estimated that illegal abortions every year account for between 80.000- 200.000 cases in Poland.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>So, what kind of abortions are available in the underground and how do women access it?</p>\n\n<p>Chirurgical abortions are one of the common ways. They\xa0usually happen in\xa0hidden spaces, often barely up to any standards, with basic equipment, sometimes only in the presence of doctor (women who come to get the abortion might end up assisting them). The price of an abortion is at least\xa02000 zl (500 euros), and it tends to go up with the standard. In some cases, when doctors are well connected, they can even perform them in hospitals, which would double the price. Many doctors who refused to perform a legal abortion are perfectly fine with doing it illegally after settling the price with their patients.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Considering that the minimal wage in Poland is 1850 zl, and the average is 4000 (yet many people struggle to get contracts, work on 3/4 of full time, or often work on irregular gigs earning even less than 1000 z\u0142 a month with no minimal wage per hour), the price is quite prohibitive and exclusive. Many women end up taking\xa0loans to pay off their abortions.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, women contact pro-choice organizations to find out\xa0who can help them with abortion. Since the 90ties, press and internet advertisements were the ways to find\xa0doctors who\'d perform them. Such services would be named as "painless restoration of menstruation"\xa0- and involve either chirurgical help or access to drugs, highly overpriced. In many cases a friend or a relative knows who does it in your town. The fear and paranoia remain anyhow - women are asked to leave the clinic right after the procedure is done, regardless of their condition, in order not to bring suspicion. They\'re asked to park their cars far away from the place of appointment.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Some of the informal groups specialize in organizing abortions abroad. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ciocia-Basia-728670193835998/?hc_location=ufi">Ciocia Basia</a>, a group of volunteer activist, helps to organize legal abortions in Berlin. For a price of 290/390 euros, they arrange pharmacological and chirurgical abortions in clinics, help with translations and offer a couch for the women coming over. Another popular destination is Slovakia and Czech Republic - it\'s super easy to find websites in Poland of clinics in these countries that provide with professional and anonymous help. Prices are similar to those in Polish underground.</p>\n\n<p>And then you have the pharmacological abortion. There are two drugs containing\xa0misoprostol registered and available in Poland, one of which can be bought without the prescription. Women usually end up making up stories about stomach pain or rheumatic grandmothers to buy them. Sometimes both of them can be obtained from "under the counter", forums also advise to ask a man to help\xa0buy them. Misoprostol should be accompanied by mifepristone to increase effectiveness (the combination of both has 98% effectiveness, while only misoprostol alone is between 80-90%), but the latter drug is not registered in Poland. In this case organizations such as <a>Women on Waves</a> help to buy and ship\xa0them <a href="http://www.womenonwaves.org/pl/page/3404/where-can-i-buy-the-abortion-pill--ru-486--mifepristone--mifeprex--mifegyne">from other countries</a> (they ask for donation of minimum of 70 euros, but they do support women in economic difficulties by providing them for free). It is well known that some of the doctors write prescriptions for these drugs (a pack of 12 costs 25 zl, but can be sold 10 or more times more expensive on the black market) and help women get access to them via advertisements. It\'s impossible to track as these drugs are not refunded by the state - therefore not registered anywhere.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Due to lack of widespread support, some of the women organize support groups on online forums. They look for other women who seek\xa0abortions or just had one, share their stories\xa0and explain to each other what happens to their bodies, how to access drugs, if nausea is a normal reaction to pills, etc. As in some cases, pharmacological abortion can lead to prolonged bleeding and even death, they offer each other a call of support during the abortion, which takes up to a day. It\'s recommended to call for an ambulance in case of emergency - doctors cannot tell if the miscarriage was illegally inducted or not, and that save\xa0lives in some\xa0instances of home abortions.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>I am still reading some more about the abortion underground in Poland, and if I find some more interesting facts, I will updated this text. I also encourage you to share your stories on how women access abortion in countries with restrictive law.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 793, u'user_id': 137, u'timestamp': u'2016-10-18 10:38:49', u'title': u'The Underground State of Women'}, {u'content': u"<p>Garden of Life</p>\n\n<p>We chose the name 'Garden of Life' \xa0for our After School projects, as we believe that every child is like a different flower, and if nourished in mind, body and spirit, will blossom all together to make this world a beautiful garden.

The project seeks to create innovation labs for real human challenges and the planet, helping shape the future instead of repeating the past. It is considered as a catalyst for a new civilization paradigm of joining forces towards \u201cupgrading humanity\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>We used the name \u2018Big Bang\u2019 in a symbolic way to highlight the explosion of new ideas and the creation of brand new knowledge from scratch. A new Big Bang of Creation is about to start at Thessaloniki in the following 2 years (2018) hoping that the idea will expand to other Greek cities and abroad. A school where learning is accomplished experientially, in harmony and interaction with the natural environment, aiming to lead children on a wonderful quest.</p>\n\n<p>Central in our philosophy is that educational activities must take place within the natural environment and the whole procedure must be supported through workshops where pupils have the opportunity to discover and connect with new information. Our educational approach encourages the development of capacities through observation, flexibility, adaptability, evaluation, goal setting and self-confidence in order to create their own path of life.</p>\n\n<p>The Big Bang Schools are furthering the vision of our initial project, the \u201cSchool of Nature and Colours\u201d. This is an educational role model of creative self-management, in which pupils are taught beyond the curriculum how to learn in-depth, sing, dance, stage theatrical plays, raise funds for their school through a vegetable garden and make their activities and campaigns are known to the public using social media.</p>\n\n<p>In this framework, we organize a unique Creative Centre for our children which we called<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Big-Bang-after-School-651071675042509/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE" rel="nofollow noopener"> BIG BANG after SCHOOL</a>\u2019. This is a comprehensive program for elementary school children and kindergarten, where all participants are able to connect with music, cinema, dance, theater, arts as well as workshops in creative thinking, constructions, architecture and engineering. Additionally, we created a specific program for elementary courses such as science, history, philosophy and multilingualism. In this project, everyone is welcome to contribute in different ways besides financial support. This is a project designed to benefit children and parents who seek for alternative educational methods of learning and interacting with people and the natural environment.</p>\n\n<p>My name is Angelos Patsias, an educator on my 30s who aims to launch various innovative activities that will help create a new educational system that will meet the specific needs of each and every place. I started my studies in Primary Level Education at the Democritus University of Thrace and I am currently reading issues for an MA candidate at the Faculty of Sociology at the University of Crete. My philosophy of life encourages me to encounter every difficult circumstance as an opportunity, and at the same time, I strongly believe that returning to the simple meaning of life is an essential action.</p>\n\n<p>My partner, Veta Georgiadou has been a kindergarten teacher in public schools for 22 years. Our collaboration in \u201cBig Bang Schools\u2019 project started when she watched my TEDx speech about \u2018<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsf2AQ9Oq9U" rel="nofollow noopener">Breaking the walls between school and society</a>\u2019. As she usually says: \u2018Children are the best tutors because they believe in miracles, the life at a present time, are full of enthusiasm and are creating all the time\u2019. She studied pedagogics, eventually becoming a wife and mother of three children and her constant self-searching voyage with pupils, parents, teachers, who never stop learning and reforming is still ongoing.</p>\n\n<p>The third partner, Yiannis Sotirakos, is a serial entrepreneur developing projects and technologies towards \u201cUpgrading Humanity\u201d, and innovative educational and edutainment platforms to empower the youth.</p>', u'post_id': 761, u'user_id': 3432, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-20 18:42:56', u'title': u'Big Bang Schools see children as tutors because they believe in miracles'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 781, u'user_id': 3451, u'timestamp': u'2016-10-05 06:18:48', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p>a story how a team started a medical camp with the intention to help as amany people as possible who otherwise would have not received care,</p>\n\n<p>Medical camps have been running in partnership with the villages of Bupsa and Bumburi attract local people from miles around, many of whom walk for many hours and often days to attend the camps. These medical camps are led by Nepalese professionals who are assisted by qualified volunteers and medical and dentistry students from the UK.</p>\n\n<p>The long and expensive journey to the hospitals in Laksha and Kathmandu (sometimes taking days) are out-of-reach for the majority living in these low-income communities. Their main source of income is from subsistence farming and small profits are often shared throughout the community. So as you can imagine, when word gets out that these clinics are nearby, villagers flock to them in the hope of securing a cure for their health issues.</p>\n\n<p>\xa0There are currently no permanent doctors in the region, which is home to a large, ethnically diverse population, spread over a number of rural communities made up of low income households. People lack access to basic health care and specialist treatment and have to walk for many days to attend the nearest hospital or else take the long and expensive journey to Kathmandu. The medical camps provide free consultation, treatment and advice from specialist qualified doctors as well as access to free medication.\xa0The goal is to one day provide the communities in these remote Himalayan villages with permanent medical care and qualified staff, rather than a temporary clinic run from an outbuilding of Bupsa\u2019s monastery.</p>\n\n<p>The group that started the initiative were limited to leftover equipment from the previous clinics\xa0and a small amount of supplies that they carried in with them.\xa0 One of the most common problems witnessed were musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). MSDs are a widely spread problem facing porters and farming communities who endure hard physical labour day-in-day-out. Muscles, joints, tendons, ligaments and nerves can all be affected, causing discomfort to intense pain. The reduction of these disorders caused through employment is a key objective of the EU through its Community Strategy, proving just how fortunate we are to benefit from\xa0accessible healthcare.</p>\n\n<p>Read the full story here: \xa0<a href="http://wildernessmedicinemagazine.com/article.asp?id=1026" rel="nofollow noopener">http://wildernessmedicinemagazine.com/article.asp?id=1026</a></p>\n\n<aside class="onebox whitelistedgeneric">\n  <header class="source">\n    <a href="https://mmtrust.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/wilderness-medicine-in-nepal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mmtrust.wordpress.com</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class="onebox-body">\n    <img src="https://mmtrust.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bupsa-village.png?fit=440%2C330" width="305" height="257" class="thumbnail">\n\n<h3><a href="https://mmtrust.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/wilderness-medicine-in-nepal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Wilderness Medicine in Nepal</a></h3>\n\n<p>Moving Mountains runs small and mobile medical camps in the remote villages of Bumburi and Bupsa, along with the surrounding villages in the Solu-Khumbu region of the Nepalese Himalayas.

People are seen as equal and every role is important, it helps to feel involved, and makes the range of possibilities bigger. But without a leader the group misses sometimes direction and efficiency is less visible. Roles are then distributed and somebody becomes head of design, head of funds or head of communication. Productivity is flowing again, but for me a subtler barrier is still in the way. From idea to task you still need preparation, and that is something I\u2019m completely lacking of.</p>\n\n<p>You could argument that everybody needs to do his part of preparation, and you can\u2019t only be the philosopher, but I lean to see a collective as an ecosystem where each other strengths are put up front and we organize ourselves around this.</p>\n\n<p>Often I tend to fill the gaps as soon as I see them. If something practical isn\u2019t been taken care of I jump to do it, because I\u2019m good at last minute problem solving, but with my lack of preparation skills, if it is to much in amount it take all my energy and i\u2019m doomed to fail, followed by personal and collective frustration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Thinkers, the Preppers and the Doers</strong></p>\n\n<p>So instead of blocking on my personal incompetence, I try to solve it by what I like doing: systemical thinking. I categorize all work inside an organization in three categories that flow in each other: Thinking, preparing and doing.</p>\n\n<p>Visualize your own strengths and weaknesses as a finite set of skill points like in a video game. In your short or long-lived life you earned skill points through events and big moments. You gathered your knowledge into one of those categories and how more you collect how more you can handle in that category, but other way around: tackling tasks inside a category you aren\u2019t good is time and energy consuming with an inefficient consequence as a a result.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you are a superhuman that can do everything alone, in an organization it is rather intelligent to search for each other complementary skills. A thinker with a lot of energy to give to do will need a preparation master as his right hand. How bigger the group how more difficult it is to find a balance, but have five thinkers and one prepper you will never get the job done.</p>\n\n<p>The big difference with a vertical organization is that in a flat organization those three categories aren\u2019t intended. Where you have specific roles inside a hierarchical organization build around power the thinker will always be above the prepper that will be above the doer. When you see everybody as equal we try to divide also the categories equal, but there is the catch: not a lot of people have throughout their lifetime chosen to equally distribute their skill points.</p>\n\n<p>What we need is better understanding about this kind of dynamic. Knowing this I\u2019m intended to take lesser practical mid-long tasks and preparative tasks on me cause I never trained myself and communicate it with my teammates to see how we can find a better dynamic inside the collective. On the other side, give me a task, well explained that takes a certain amount of time, even repetitive, I\u2019m your guy.</p>', u'post_id': 785, u'user_id': 3293, u'timestamp': u'2016-10-07 11:04:24', u'title': u'Collaborative Tools 1: Why flat organizations still need honest role division'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 775, u'user_id': 3380, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-30 14:42:07', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p><em>Loic made a paper to analyse\xa0squat\xa0spaces that are more then meets\xa0the eye.

Plus qu\u2019un toit elle offre \xe0 ses habitants une structure physique et sociale o\xf9 s\u2019\xe9panouir.

Les activit\xe9s au rez-de-chauss\xe9e cr\xe9ent une vie de quartier \xe9vitant toute ghetto\xefsation.</p>\n\n<p>Les ateliers permettent aux habitants d\u2019apprendre, d\xe9velopper ou partager leurs connaissances et leur savoir-faire. Bien que la vie dans une communaut\xe9 telle que celle du \xab123\xbb peut devenir \xe9prouvante par moments, elle permet d\u2019\xe9viter l\u2019isolement des habitants les plus vuln\xe9rables et permet \xe0 ceux qui ne se retrouvent pas dans les solutions conventionnelles un moyen d\'explorer de nouvelles pistes pour l\'habiter en ville. Une m\xe9diation permanente des conflits qui apparaissent inexorablement dans une communaut\xe9 aussi importante est n\xe9cessaire et figure parmi les conditions indispensables de r\xe9ussite de ce genre d\'exp\xe9rience. Ainsi ces b\xe9n\xe9fices se font au co\xfbt d\u2019une gestion rigoureuse et d\u2019une \xe9nergie consid\xe9rable \xe0 d\xe9ployer quotidiennement par les habitants pour la communaut\xe9. Nous avons r\xe9alis\xe9 \xe0 quel point l\u2019inclusion des usagers d\'un habitat est importante pour r\xe9ussir un projet de logement, Le mouvement semble n\xe9anmoins en marche et l\u2019association logements123 wonen a commence \xe0 transposer l\u2019exp\xe9rience \xe0 d\u2019autres batiments avec d\u2019autres habitants.</p>\n\n<p>Ceci en tirant parti des le\xe7ons apprises au 123, ainsi qu\u2019au tagawa et au G\xe9su. Malgr\xe9 le statut temporaire et incertain de l\u2019occupation, il semblerait que plus que le b\xe9ton du b\xe2timent, ce sont les habitants qui portent le projet du \xab123\xbb. \xab(\u2026) les logements alternatifs ne sont pas abordables parce que l\u2019ensemble des exigences qui y sont li\xe9es ne correspondent ni aux r\xe9alit\xe9s qu\u2019ils vivent, ni \xe0 leurs moyens (co\xfbt des mat\xe9riaux, acc\xe8s aux primes, confrontation aux normes de salubrit\xe9, s\xe9curit\xe9, urbanisme\u2026). Ce que les plus pauvres construisent au quotidien, ce sont des alternatives au logement, pour se garantir un habitat qui soit abordable financi\xe8rement et dont ils auront la maitrise\xbb 57 ainsi que les l\u2019importance des gains de la mutualisation de fonctions communes. Ces gains ne se chiffrent pas qu\u2019en m\xe8tres carr\xe9s, mais surtout en contacts sociaux quotidiens, un partage des ressources et une \xe9conomie en \xe9nergie. Ce mod\xe8le n\u2019est n\xe9anmoins pas sans limitations. On peut craindre avec l\u2019accroissement de la popularit\xe9 du projet une gentrification des habitants. Aussi la liste d\u2019attente pour trouver une place, m\xeame si moins longue que pour un logement social est l\xe0 pour rappeler que l\u2019occupation d\u2019un seul b\xe2timent n\u2019est pas une solution exhaustive au manque de logement. La nature urgente de la question du logement \xe0 Bruxelles demande un engagement des pouvoirs public dans une politique de favorisation de telles initiatives.</p>\n\n<p>Ceci en adaptant le cadre l\xe9gal et en informant les propri\xe9taires sur les avantages de\xa0telles initiatives. Ce travail nous permet de d\xe9gager trois points primordiaux pour le mise en place r\xe9ussie de ce genre d\'initiative:</p>\n\n<p><strong>- L\'implication active et quotidienne des habitants\xa0dans un projet commun.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>- La collaboration et l\'information des propri\xe9taires\xa0de b\xe2timents vides</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>- La permissivit\xe9 ou l\'encadrement par les authorit\xe9s."</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can find the complete publication here: <a href="http://www.academia.edu/16771654/LE_DROIT_%C3%A0_LHABITAT_PAR_LOCCUPATION" rel="nofollow noopener">www.academia.edu/16771654/LE_DROIT_\xe0_LHABITAT_PAR_LOCCUPATION</a></p>\n\n<h3>123 was a previously\xa0office building occupied by the French community which had been vacant for 15 years. Groups of squatters moved in and made a deal with the owner to run different workshops - bike fixing, woodwork, IT etc.</h3>\n\n<p>Some interesting facts from his paper:</p>\n\n<p>-social housing in Bxl is much lower, 7 % compared to the 27% in the Netherlands</p>\n\n<p>-7 % of houses totally empty</p>\n\n<p>-1 000 000 sq metres of unused office space: 40% of empty offices have been empty for 7 years</p>\n\n<p>From squatting to a participatory process -\xa0 a public owned space (Community Francais) but community managed: from refugees to Irish artists to Flemish doctor students. Half the people (of 60) don\'t have any revenues, and everyone contributes a little - from 60 eur a month to approx. 150.\xa0\xa0In Belgium it is possible to have a temporary legal occupation for an office, so you can live in an office space!</p>\n\n<p>It\'s an office building, which means people can change the layout easily. This makes it an interesting testcase for architects that are experimenting with commun space. The big difference between buildings for profit and the testcase of 123:</p>\n\n<p>Profit building is praised for being open while just having 7% of their space being used for community. 123 has almost 50% of community used space, but because of their \'illegal\' status it isn\'t praised.\xa0Loic showed a detailed distribution of the types of spaces - at each floor you\'d have facilities, workshops, library + distribution of private and communal space. \xa0Important detail: Stairs are used instead of working elevators as a social control mechanism.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Loic is trying to give more visibility to housing solutions - it\'s not easy, he says, and it\'s important to make good contact with the owner!

There will be mentors (physiotherapists, engineers and designers etc.) and together we will create solutions to personal needs in form of assistive devices. A cooperative model where citizens with various skills can work together on realizing devices for use in everyday life, that will improve or maintain individual functional capabilities. This model will explore ways to transfer research results directly to users (target participants). New and existing ideas will be challenged and transformed into methods and assistive technology for activities of daily living. Initial focus will be to demonstrate how the challenges of mobility can be resolved by helping people's creativity in a social environment. One challenges that people often meet is the need for adaptation of tools to be able to perform day-to-day tasks as .abilities change, In the WeHandU laboratory people will be able (and helped) to implement such changes.</p>\n\n<h3>More participants = more results</h3>\n\n<p>The basis of WeHandU is to be volitional participation of people with skills in various aspects of assistive technology. Solutions will vary from realizing simple mechanical aids to involvement of expert researchers. The new infrastructures of makerspaces (also known as fablabs or hackerspaces), allowing the do-it-yourself construction of objects, lend itself as a host for the WeHandU initiative. Here sophisticated devices can be prototyped using advanced machining processes (e.g. 3D printing). A lot of individuals create a personal DIY solutions. Those not marketed or provided by the health service can be manufactured in the WeHandU framework. Likewise subsequent modifications can be easily be implemented as new needs arise. People challenged by MS, stroke and SCI will find help in peers, designers, engineers networking with clinicians as well as people with \u2018soft\u2019 skills in the socializing context of a makerspace. One of the concrete challenges to resolve is addressing the problem of dropped foot . With a vast practical experience we can guide people to select, try or even construct their foot drop correcting stimulator. A device that, despite solid proof of efficiency in scientific literature, has not been adopted by the healthcare systems. Another of the most important problems regards the vanishing hand function. Here a recently developed technology comes in. It\u2019s a open source (meaning that all details of how to replicate are publically available) device for strengthening the hand, using FES (mecfes.wikispaces.com). It has been tested clinically for improving hand function in SCI, but there is no contraindications for applying it to people living with MS. Most important of all, this initiative in synergy with OpenCare will challenge the existing healthcare providers to adopt the model and provide a more user centered approach.</p>\n\n<p>The WeHandU idea is mainly concerned about preserving autonomy by assistive technology for the hand function and walking using state of the art technological inventions combined with simple do-it-yourself manufacturing techniques in a socially engaging environment. Use of nowadays rapid-prototyping technologies(es. 3d printing), allows to bring creative people together for an effective low-cost collaboration process which brings real and efficient industrial solutions in relatively short time.</p>", u'post_id': 720, u'user_id': 3327, u'timestamp': u'2016-08-22 17:33:12', u'title': u'WeHandU - maker space for developing solutions for cases of motor impairment'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 782, u'user_id': 3457, u'timestamp': u'2016-10-06 18:58:18', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<hr>\n\n<p>Summary ENG + FR</p>\n\n<p>L\'atelier a g\xe9n\xe9r\xe9 beaucoup de contenu que vous pouvez retrouver ici-bas.

Dans cet atelier, nous avons essay\xe9 de trouver ce qui \xe9tait important \xe0 r\xe9ussir pour les collaborations, et ainsi nous en venons au deuxi\xe8me point :</p>\n\n<ol><li>Comment cr\xe9ons-nous de la Confiance entre organisations inconnues, mais avec le m\xeame genre de pens\xe9e ?</li></ol>\n\n<p>Nous avons eu un test grandeur nature : une quinzaine d\'organisations, partageant des valeurs communes et dispos\xe9es \xe0 collaborer et apprendre les unes des autres, mais qui venaient \xe0 peine de se rencontrer. Apr\xe8s d\'autres d\xe9bats, nous avons r\xe9alis\xe9 que la confiance \xe9tait le principal probl\xe8me.\xa0Nous avons donc essay\xe9 d\u2019encadrer la cr\xe9ation de confiance en nous avons constat\xe9 que c\u2019\xe9tait mieux d\u2019avoir des petits projets entre les diff\xe9rents groupes\xa0 \xa0afin de cr\xe9er des liens entre les personnes. Ces projets peuvent \xeatre \xa0des petits projets r\xe9alisables en quelques minutes ou une heure. A\xa0partir de l\xe0 chaque pas suivant deviens une tache\xa0 plus complexe que la pr\xe9c\xe9dente pour cr\xe9er ainsi un lien plus fort.</p>\n\n<div>\n\n<p>3.\xa0 \xa0Donner de perspectives alternatives\xa0 aux soins nous fait r\xe9fl\xe9chir sur notre propre structure de soins.</p>\n\n<p>Finalement nous avions un de participants \xa0qui nous a aid\xe9s \xe0 penser out of the box d\u2019une mani\xe8re perturbatrice. C\u2019\xe9tait un refugi\xe9e Syrien \xa0qui a d\xfb\xa0 reporter ses \xe9tudes de m\xe9dicine pour fuir du pays et qui nous a donner\xa0 beaucoup des choses \xe0 r\xe9fl\xe9chir. Il nous voyait comme\xa0 des \xab\xa0boxpeople\xa0\xbb , vivant dans une bulle et pla\xe7ant \xa0des autres gens dans des bulles. Les personnes \xe2g\xe9es, les sans-abri, les personnes avec des maladies psychologiques, etc.\xa0; ils sont tous plac\xe9s en dehors de la soci\xe9t\xe9.</p>\n\n<p>Il explique qu\u2019en Syrie ils n\u2019avaient peut-\xeatre pas un syst\xe8me de soins de sant\xe9 efficace, mais\xa0 il est beaucoup plus humain. Ceci nous a fait penser\xa0 sur la fa\xe7on comment nous voyons les soins en Europe. C\u2019est aussi lui qui nous a signal\xe9 sur le probl\xe8me de confiance qui est cr\xe9\xe9 ici dans l\u2019ouest.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Workshop gave us a lot of content that you can find here. But for those who are result oriented we compiled the most important knowledge bubbels here.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Everybody is in search of collaboration solutions, but have difficulties realizing them.</p>\n\n<p>After the first round of discussions we noticed that all kind of organizations are ready to become more collaborative, but they are missing the step-by-step tools to achieve this.\xa0They all are conscious about the power of collaboration, but have never had successful long lasting experiences. The goal of this workshop was to find the key elements to make a collaborative initiative succeed, this leads us to the second point.</p>\n\n<p>2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0How do we create trust between unbeknown organizations that share the same way of thinking?</p>\n\n<p>We had a great test case: around 15 organizations that came together for the first time, all sharing the same ideas and willing to collaborate to learn from each other. After a lot of discussions we discovered trust was the main issue.\xa0 So we tried to frame how trust is built and concluded that we needed to start with small projects with each other, these projects don\u2019t need to be longer\xa0 than a couple of minutes/hours, this way people start to bond. After that each following project can become more complex to create a stronger bodn between the participants. \xa0We listed a couple of thing each would do, to immidiate have a Proof Of Concept.</p>\n\n<ol><li>Giving other perspectives of care makes us think about our own caretaking\xa0structure</li></ol>\n\n<p>Finally we had one person that helped think out of the box in a really disruptive way. He was a Syrian refugee that had to postpone his medical studies/Ph.D.\xa0 To flee the country and gave us a lot of material to think about. He saw us as \'boxpeople\', living in a bubble and putting others in bubbles. Elderly, homeless people, psychological ill are all given a space outside society. They maybe didn\'t have the most efficient healthcare system, but he explained it was much more humane. It made us think a lot about how we see care in the west. He was also the person that pointed out the problem of trust we create in the west.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Last Saturday we hosted a quit successful workshop in Brussels around the Open &amp; Care thematic with local participants and workers of the designated field. We had a set up loosely based on the Berlin workshop and will go deeper into the methodology, the preparation, the participants and outcome in the following text. This article is a more organized version of <a href="https://titanpad.com/KRlyZXvSW6" rel="nofollow noopener">the thinkpad</a> we put online at the workshop and where people could transcribe what was being said.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Preparation</strong></h2><ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Reaching out\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kay79fljblycy0s/Dutch.docx?dl=0" rel="nofollow noopener">Dutch</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/30ens5ljqq9xjmj/French.docx?dl=0" rel="nofollow noopener">French</a> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/75wbo2yut2s5cij/Targeted%20invitation%20to%20interviews.docx?dl=0" rel="nofollow noopener">&amp; English invitations</a>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>In the beginning of the preparation of the workshop I reached out to my network of socially involved people who could have interesting stories to add to the platform. It was sometime difficult to explain them the whole concept through mail, so I decided to meet the people who wanted more information. This gave me the following <a href="https://metamaps.cc/maps/2175" rel="nofollow noopener">graphical content</a>. Without surprise the most active and responsive people came from the makers and changemakers scene. They immediately connected to the higher goal and activated their network. The least responsive network where the politicians, coming back from their annual non-active period it was difficult to activate them. Every attempt ended up in a dead end.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li><a href="/t/generating-a-community-around-the-workshop/5840">How to create the community</a></li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>But after a couple of weeks building up a community, a moment of panic occurred. The people where reacting positively towards the workshop, but hesitated to get more involved. The confirmed list of people was stagnating, so I opened a debate on the Edgeryders platform to see how we can resolve that issue. After getting some clarifications from the team that organized the <a href="/t/after-thessaloniki-tips-information-and-ideas/5841">Greek workshop</a> and some tips from people that organized a lot of workshops i changed my method and opened up with a more general approach through mailing lists and facebook groups. The combination of both locally anchored contacts and general presentations of the workshop filled the last gaps. We had 28 confirmed people and around 40 interested contacts in a mailing list.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>One on One discussions / Text submissions</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Before the workshop occurred this where the people wanting to start already a conversation on their work around social and medical care.

Maria found a socially involved catering service, Sigried arranged the space to be workshop ready, Toha was responsible for the photographical documentation and Cecile prepared everything so the outcome would be documented in a nice visual style by using Toha\u2019s skills and the templates.

I helped out by translating the most difficult parts in French or English so anybody could speak there native language if needed. This facilitated the conversation.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Documentation</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Cecile, Noemi and Toha played all an important role in the documentation.

Here you can find some of the insights</p>\n\n<p><strong>Winnie:</strong> he noticed that every project has some community in it, but communities experience different ways of being in the world, different incentives for being in a community.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Laurent</strong>: 3 different projects, which have something in common, with people being excluded by the system because they are poor or sick. Empowerment for these populations is at the core of each project. Behind each there is a diagnosis of how the excluded population can have lost access to institutional support.\xa0If something is possible, it is on the edge, where people can regain access to their lives.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lotfi:</strong> Nous \xe9tions trois entit\xe9s, je suis avec Selvi, nous avons eu une maison de repos, Xander travaille avec des enfants autiste, Alkasem, il esp\xe8re qu\'il pourrait faire son m\xe9tier de m\xe9decin.

Alkasem a fait la parall\xe8le de comment le syst\xe8me de soin ce passe en moyen orient, une culture musulman de l\'entraide. On impose de donner de l\'argent au pauvre. Tout le monde vie ici dans sa bulle, il n\u2019y a pas de transversalit\xe9.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Xander:\xa0</strong> the community aspect is really important, the human is seen as a kind of predator, humans are also caring beings.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alkasem:</strong> i have question to all of you: where are the families of the homeless people? I never saw anyone homeless in Syria, or living on a mattress. How did it happen? Some of the participants responded later on:\xa0</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>the core family concept has been broken down - after uni and growing up you have to carry yourself; so there is no glue which keeps family together</li>\n\n</ul><ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>in North Africa systems are weak -so there has always been a cultural support; whereas in the West the system is supposed to take care of everything</li>\n\n</ul><ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Here (in the West) you are free, but alone!</li>\n\n</ul><ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>"Free, but alone." vs. "Belonging,\xa0but coerced" Comparing systems-based\xa0 vs. family-based cultures of care <a href="https://twitter.com/alberto_cottica/status/779632492940783618" rel="nofollow noopener">(twitter link)</a>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/7674e81184c199abbea3a75d821e62720183a87a" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7674e81184c199abbea3a75d821e62720183a87a.jpg" class="lightbox" title="IMG_7520.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/7674e81184c199abbea3a75d821e62720183a87a_1_690x460.jpg" width="690" height="460"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">IMG_7520.jpg</span><span class="informations">1536x1024 973 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>Jean:</strong> There is a desire of using new ways of technology to organize his place within the society je cherche a me socialiser, trouver une occupation profitable, mais je voudrais rester dans la marginalit\xe9. Find a meaning in his life, but stay at the edge of society.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Claire</strong>: I want to create something can provide something that can give help to each other. It is very complicated to arrive there. With Laurent, Sophie, we have a point of connection, but we need to know each other better. I worked for several years around the project of self-care. I want to do something very new. We are creating to work on a project on different levels in December with Laurent, but it is really difficult to find what is most needed: partnership and collaboration.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Adeline:</strong> Everybody here came with a need, to find ways to come up with a solution, tous le monde est venue avec un besoin, elle esp\xe8re aider \xe0 trouver une solution.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gilles:</strong> Strongly believes in open source and data sharing solutions - everyone is looking for someone who can help them with a solution eg. to develop a website to help the project moving.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Loic:</strong> The core needs he noticed in others is to learn information about what others are doing, get information about collaborations; and second, the need for visibility. Personally he has come here for housing project, but Winnie\'s story is useful to hear also professionally.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yannick:</strong> was in conversation with Kacim,Lotfi - the intergenerational interactions need to be looked into, because it is in only specific circumstances that we spend time together eg living in a house with my grandmother and the positive outcomes which came from that.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 <strong>SIDENOTE: Multiple times in the discussion a same metaphor that was introduced by Alkasem was used by the participants. He noted that our western society made us all \u2018boxpeople\u2019. He finds it so strange that we are all living next to each other, but that we aren\u2019t interacting better. We put old people in a home and (mentally) sick people in a closed environment. I found that metaphor really strong and something to use when we are trying to connect multiple organizations. </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question time</strong></p>\n\n<p>After giving everybody the chance to share their view on the received input we gave everybody 5 minutes the time transcribe it in a question they wanted to solve in the second part of the day.

Three of them where <strong>DoucheFlux</strong>, <strong>Belgium Designers Council</strong> and <strong>Habitats 123: A testcase of alternative housing</strong>. A summary can be found here:</p>\n\n<h3>Laurent d\'Ursel / DoucheFLUX:</h3>\n\n<p>4 years old project, we are opening a huge house to help people out of the marge, we will have 20 showers, 150 lockers, medical service, laundries, a pharmecy, and other needed services for this part of people, which is missing\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Second pillar is activities: DoucheFlux is 50m2 at the moment, so we work at other spaces, we make activities that promote self esteem for these people, they are totally embedded in the system, they can\'t escape what is happening about them, they find it difficult to get further, so their mechanism is that they just stop trying, because they don\'t feel empowered anymore</p>\n\n<p>Doucheflux helps them to get more self-esteem, but it is difficult because sometimes it feel that we are infantilizing them, and if you do that mistake they don\'t come anymore</p>\n\n<p>The challenge: another way to make social work, so not only people that studied for the social sector. To take the social dream out of the social field and bring it to other fields. Because they are fed up of all the social help, they just want a happy life: it is not only important to have an home, but also to create great moments. <strong>To create equal relationships. break racism against the poor.\xa0</strong></p>\n\n<h3>Rozina / Business Imporvements Design Belgium</h3>\n\n<p>Living in Bxl for 15 years, an interior designer coming from a corporate background working in the hospitality business. She started her own design company and got more involved in strategic design thinking - now involved with the Belgium Design Thinking. Projects to make the sports clubs more inclusive because they were closed for refugees; also hardly accessible by children with special needs. So with other people they pushed for inclusivity and speaking to the Belgium Football Union, but also preparing a strategy for the next few years.</p>\n\n<p>Business Improvements Design Belgium (BIDs): they are about creating a new geographical zone and linking community businesses to it, ideal for private - public partnerships.</p>\n\n<p>She is lobbying for BIDs and wants to see where stakeholders can meet in the middle; seems idealistic especially since she\'s not from here.</p>\n\n<p>Has seen encouraging results after talking to her mayor, and right now she\'s trying to create a youth platform for citizenship and sports - an IDEO design type of commune.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>What changed after the football? <strong>People understood there is a strategy and structure, so they get a sense of belonging. If everybody contributes something, we become as a community.We educate the value of communication, transparency...</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rozina would need help to connect with people working hands on with special needs populations.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/5f06bf7675ae198544e232fa0109178b2507ea88" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5f06bf7675ae198544e232fa0109178b2507ea88.jpg" class="lightbox" title="IMG_3024.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/5f06bf7675ae198544e232fa0109178b2507ea88_1_690x460.jpg" width="690" height="460"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">IMG_3024.jpg</span><span class="informations">1536x1024 1.07 MB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<h3>Loic / Right to Housing in Brussels</h3>\n\n<p>Previously office building occupied by the French community which had been vacant for 15 years. Groups of squatters moved in and made a deal with the owner to run different workshops - bike fixing, woodwork, IT etc.</p>\n\n<p>Some interesting facts from his paper:</p>\n\n<p>-social housing in Bxl is much lower, 7 % compared to the 27% in the Netherlands</p>\n\n<p>-7 % of houses totally empty</p>\n\n<p>-1 000 000 sq metres of unused office space: 40% of empty offices have been empty for 7 years</p>\n\n<p>From squatting to a participatory process -\xa0 a public owned space (Community Francais) but community managed: from refugees to Irish artists to Flemish doctor students. Half the people (of 60) don\'t have any revenues, and everyone contributes a little - from 60 eur a month to approx. 150.\xa0\xa0<strong>In Belgium it is possible to have a temporary legal occupation for an office, so you can live in an office space!</strong></p>\n\n<p>It\'s an office building, which means people can change the layout easily.</p>\n\n<p>Difference between buildings for profit and the testcase of 123:</p>\n\n<p>Profit building is praised for being open while just having 7% of their space being used for community. 123 has almost 50% of community used space, but because of their \'illegal\' status it isn\'t praised.</p>\n\n<p>Loic showed a detailed distribution of the types of spaces - at each floor you\'d have facilities, workshops, library + distribution of private and communal space.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important detail: Stairs instead of working elevators as a social control mechanism.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Loic is trying to give more visibility to housing solutions - it\'s not easy, take good contact with the owner! <strong>First you squad, then you talk.</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Collaboration Mosaic</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now it is time to get into the concrete part of the workshop.

So Nadia came up with a good idea to end the workshop with something concrete. We all felt that one of the biggest issues in care is that we live to much on our own island and that if we want to make care better we need to share and collaborate. But to collaborate we need to create trust. So this exercise was given to every participant and will hopefully end up in solidifying the care network in Belgium.

However; of what\xa0use could these benefits be if there is nothing to do? In Germany, refugees are not allowed\xa0to pick proper work for the first three months of their stay. After that period, a working\xa0permit is needed to apply for a job. The permit, however, is only granted if the person is no\xa0longer living in a refugee camp. Needless to say, the said three months often pass without\xa0anything really happening and three months slowly turn into six months and into a year\xa0- during which there is nothing to do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We are currently working at the Internationales Congress Centrum (ICC) in Berlin</strong>- a former congress center that has recently been turned into a refugee camp. Even with the circumstances being unfavourable, the atmosphere at the ICC is quite the opposite: The interaction between the refugees and the staff and security is remarkably free and friendly.\xa0Volunteers playing with children; refugees and security joking around and everybody is eating at the same table. There is no hint of the provider/receiver-dilemma that you would witness in other establishments.\xa0We\u2019ve been warmly welcomed by the people and the relationships have gradually grown more personal since our first visit.</p>\n\n<p>The place is led by the Malteser; we were shown around the place by one of their very nice volunteers. She then introduced us to a room of eight Syrians, four of which were ready to help us in our project and provided us with insights.</p>\n\n<p>Besides stories over everyday rituals like tea and Syrian home traditions, we were shown the little gimmicks to improve the bare rooms where they are living in at the moment: How they pulled out screws and nails from the walls to make clothing hooks; how you make a wall-mounted phone holder with just duct tape and a piece of wood; where to store the food; they showed us how they hack the beds to create more privacy and how to shield the light falling onto the upper beds with merely pieces of wood and a blanket to a point where one could create an entire ceiling with just white cloth.</p>\n\n<p>We learnt quickly that the ideas of how to use the space could never occur to someone who has never been in that exact position:\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>It was evident that they know best about\xa0the needs and necessities in their very situation and environment.</strong></p>\n\n<p>With the creative potential, the only problem lies in the lack of tools and materials.\xa0To see what would happen if material were available, we made a little experiment where\xa0we brought basics like duct tape, cable ties, string and durable cardboard and looked\xa0what they would think of building intuitively. Despite scepticism in the beginning, it was\xa0beautiful to witness the moment when everyone in the room joined to figure out the best\xa0construction for a wall-mounted shelf, built with mortise and tenon joints. The fact the\xa0project was dealt with in such a manner, shows the willingness to engage these kinds of\xa0challenges with seriousness and a certain claim to quality and that it is not only about\xa0practicality and pure function, for such a shelf could have been easily assembled withjust tape and cardboard. It was fun for us to join the working process and thinking with\xa0them about the construction and making, but more importantly, it was fun for them to be\xa0challenged in making something useful and to make that beautifully. Mohammed, who\xa0came up with the idea of using joinery, later joked saying he would love to make such\xa0shelves for the whole camp - and we hoped, it was not merely a joke, but a mentality that we\xa0could continue to work with. In fact, we left all the spare materials in their rooms and by our next visit they had built another two shelves and a small storage for clothes under one of the beds.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SeS9xq-BK7XIQnTHf0SCITt2EeFoBXWx88uniE9pPcQeigJtPNMWXvskrMVBuwW2J121-lJbSzMQJtnfK0-L0xmynHHZdBaZzB4rCLteArdXzDcySWC_Su6KCDoiGZYIwHrcbA3N" class="lightbox" title="SeS9xq-BK7XIQnTHf0SCITt2EeFoBXWx88uniE9pPcQeigJtPNMWXvskrMVBuwW2J121-lJbSzMQJtnfK0-L0xmynHHZdBaZzB4rCLteArdXzDcySWC_Su6KCDoiGZYIwHrcbA3N" rel="nofollow noopener"><img height="223" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SeS9xq-BK7XIQnTHf0SCITt2EeFoBXWx88uniE9pPcQeigJtPNMWXvskrMVBuwW2J121-lJbSzMQJtnfK0-L0xmynHHZdBaZzB4rCLteArdXzDcySWC_Su6KCDoiGZYIwHrcbA3N" width="263"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">SeS9xq-BK7XIQnTHf0SCITt2EeFoBXWx88uniE9pPcQeigJtPNMWXvskrMVBuwW2J121-lJbSzMQJtnfK0-L0xmynHHZdBaZzB4rCLteArdXzDcySWC_Su6KCDoiGZYIwHrcbA3N</span><span class="informations">1600x1200</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ePUoxX2S3DlJlKiEcU88WsFkZJ1k1KI3KZ3SoxxIdyMlFPkwq6BJvr3VbS8WLXEopxxuPrEbZ_s3aVnq7N_wl1UKD2qRUKwnOnBPiFf5Jlgh1oCNL5oL1tn2VhpUbVOOKTZkrwBg" class="lightbox" title="ePUoxX2S3DlJlKiEcU88WsFkZJ1k1KI3KZ3SoxxIdyMlFPkwq6BJvr3VbS8WLXEopxxuPrEbZ_s3aVnq7N_wl1UKD2qRUKwnOnBPiFf5Jlgh1oCNL5oL1tn2VhpUbVOOKTZkrwBg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img height="222" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ePUoxX2S3DlJlKiEcU88WsFkZJ1k1KI3KZ3SoxxIdyMlFPkwq6BJvr3VbS8WLXEopxxuPrEbZ_s3aVnq7N_wl1UKD2qRUKwnOnBPiFf5Jlgh1oCNL5oL1tn2VhpUbVOOKTZkrwBg" width="296"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">ePUoxX2S3DlJlKiEcU88WsFkZJ1k1KI3KZ3SoxxIdyMlFPkwq6BJvr3VbS8WLXEopxxuPrEbZ_s3aVnq7N_wl1UKD2qRUKwnOnBPiFf5Jlgh1oCNL5oL1tn2VhpUbVOOKTZkrwBg</span><span class="informations">1600x1200</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><em>Work in progress: Building a shelf</em></p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/slVlOs-VysXEUvFeyeD0AAgm2t3xVJSOCRzUJQ569o18rGOb8UTn3_UWVGH2faeyS2xuNQUm38As6dv_r3i0TMK8W2Vk-hatL6Ci0PWudQQy7bMdEDs6N_fjGM55oT3pivqzaWw-" class="lightbox" title="slVlOs-VysXEUvFeyeD0AAgm2t3xVJSOCRzUJQ569o18rGOb8UTn3_UWVGH2faeyS2xuNQUm38As6dv_r3i0TMK8W2Vk-hatL6Ci0PWudQQy7bMdEDs6N_fjGM55oT3pivqzaWw-" rel="nofollow noopener"><img height="361" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/slVlOs-VysXEUvFeyeD0AAgm2t3xVJSOCRzUJQ569o18rGOb8UTn3_UWVGH2faeyS2xuNQUm38As6dv_r3i0TMK8W2Vk-hatL6Ci0PWudQQy7bMdEDs6N_fjGM55oT3pivqzaWw-" width="502"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">slVlOs-VysXEUvFeyeD0AAgm2t3xVJSOCRzUJQ569o18rGOb8UTn3_UWVGH2faeyS2xuNQUm38As6dv_r3i0TMK8W2Vk-hatL6Ci0PWudQQy7bMdEDs6N_fjGM55oT3pivqzaWw-</span><span class="informations">1600x1200</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div>\xa0\xa0<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2BgFMUhk2do3FM_OCRbXgkvXunxUZPrVW2Zj3x6TDA-Cgp79VH4dyY1xfdgasEa6i6f2pN5_ks04A-o1BAyBzWI36AVNce_wLQtsD0phtx8S0He9p-A51JMhX0ol6S8J854n29w1" class="lightbox" title="2BgFMUhk2do3FM_OCRbXgkvXunxUZPrVW2Zj3x6TDA-Cgp79VH4dyY1xfdgasEa6i6f2pN5_ks04A-o1BAyBzWI36AVNce_wLQtsD0phtx8S0He9p-A51JMhX0ol6S8J854n29w1" rel="nofollow noopener"><img height="377" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2BgFMUhk2do3FM_OCRbXgkvXunxUZPrVW2Zj3x6TDA-Cgp79VH4dyY1xfdgasEa6i6f2pN5_ks04A-o1BAyBzWI36AVNce_wLQtsD0phtx8S0He9p-A51JMhX0ol6S8J854n29w1" width="502"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">2BgFMUhk2do3FM_OCRbXgkvXunxUZPrVW2Zj3x6TDA-Cgp79VH4dyY1xfdgasEa6i6f2pN5_ks04A-o1BAyBzWI36AVNce_wLQtsD0phtx8S0He9p-A51JMhX0ol6S8J854n29w1</span><span class="informations">1600x1200</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><em>Image above: One of the shelves that Mohammed made after we left.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mohammed\u2019s mentality is exactly what we we\u2019re looking for. </strong></p>\n\n<p>The question is if more people in the camp would share the same enthusiasm. Ideally, a craftsman could be found to take the role of a tutor to guide the others into the basics of building. On our last visit in the camp we learnt that the the camp\u2019s organizers are taking help of one of the refugees who used to be a tailor. He now has his working space (a table with a sewing machine) at the intern clothes depot and helps fixing the garments before they\u2019re given out.</p>\n\n<p>We feel the answer to our problem lies in establishing and expanding that very concept in other camps as well - to involve people in the daily happenings and motivate them to do what they can do best. We will research the willingness amongst the refugees to join such a program as soon as soon as Ramadan is over.</p>\n\n<p>Our plan to help people improving their living situation by building their own furniture is a first step in that direction. We are working on a solution that doesn\xb4t require proffessional skills or tools, but motivates people and gives them the feeling of doing something useful for them and the community. To establish this first step we are going to launch a fundraising campaign on StartNext in the next weeks and we are happy about any kind of support!

We started our project RefugeesWork to help newcomers to connect with locals who are looking for freelancers to outsource some work to them.</p>\n\n<p>It all started in August 2015 when lots of newcomers, mainly from Syria, arrived to Germany.</p>\n\n<p>It now turns out that it\u2019s not very easy for them to find any kind of employment at all. German companies seem to not need the skills they bring to the table and even if they do have what they are looking for, they often reject people who do not speak German well.</p>\n\n<p>We decided to use our digital skills, first of all programming, to help them. We developed a marketplace app where on one side newcomers can register and describe their skills and on the other side local organizations can post their requests for freelancers. We believe work is the best pathway to connect refugees and locals and to date, we have over 300 registrations on the site and big community in Berlin and online. Those Syrians come from all walks of life and some have excellent background, or were running their own business.</p>\n\n<p>But we also realized that freelance requests are mostly for freelancers with web and mobile development background. These are the jobs freelancers can do online, they don\'t need to speak the local language and because all the organizations are trying to automate their processes, there is actually a big need for these professions. We checked our database and available statistics and figured out that most of newcomers are young, they just finished their high school or had to leave in the middle of their studies so they actually lack necessary skills to integrate into the highly specialized German job market. Freelancing would give refugees freedom from discrimination they would face otherwise and freelancers are usually paid way better. The tricky part is in making sure there is a regular flow of work. That is <a href="http://www.refugeeswork.com/en/leads" rel="nofollow noopener">our experience</a>.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/4318361ce323d1066d2813f619ea9a4f95794a7e" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4318361ce323d1066d2813f619ea9a4f95794a7e.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Refugeeswork.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/4318361ce323d1066d2813f619ea9a4f95794a7e_1_690x458.jpg" width="690" height="458"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Refugeeswork.jpg</span><span class="informations">960x638 84.1 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>Therefore we decided to extend our Berlin based coding school for kids and use our experiences to create online e-learning platform to teach newcomers programming: from how to install browser to how to build your mobile app. All the learners can learn digital skills/programming no matter where they are, they get 24/7 support on the chat from mentors and other learners and later and they can apply for projects companies outsource through RefugeesWork. All the learners become part of digital collective Coding Amigos, that we started with international crew of developers with activist streak already 3 years ago. We meet in Berlin 2x a week and co-work together on client projects or our own apps that we in long term want to connect in a circular economy. For us - even though circular economy is usually connected to recycling - that means that supply chains form supply circles and money is not loaned by governments and other usual suspects and end up in always the same pockets who save it and don\u2019t even know what to do with all the money.</p>\n\n<p>Currently we are also following the work of Sensorica in Canada and Enspiral in New Zealand. Our wish is to create a micro-holding co-ownership model. One part of the motivation is to shield these professionals from all kinds of discrimination that they might otherwise experience.</p>\n\n<p>It shields them, for example from the usual politicking among corporate employees who might tend to put such newcomers into a fairly low place. And another part of the motivation is exploring processes and legal ways for cooperation and decision making between many micro-holdings.</p>\n\n<p>We try to list all our initiatives inside of Github organization SquatUp.</p>\n\n<p>We try to keep all our work open and transparent for which we for now use Github.com, Gitter.im and Waffle.io which allow us versioned storing our documents, including code, working on issues on a kanban board and use open communication on a public chat.</p>\n\n<p>All our projects are made with zero budget so with pure love and dedication for our mission: open source &amp; transparency, inclusiveness, digital literacy and open organization. It is not easy, but we don\'t want to waste our time chasing funding and investors or clients, but instead co-create the world we want to live in. And we believe right people and opportunities will come from that and from the people that share the mindset and want to join us.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard to make a living with all of this, so we just try to live as cheap as possible and we work for a better future where society is organized differently utilizing radical transparency and open source. Until then we live from savings that we sometimes manage to build when working on paid projects. By empowering refugees with skills we hope they will later become our partners and continue to help us build an alternative work. On top of that, we might manage to get in projects on a more regular basis and outsource paid work to each other.</p>\n\n<p>So if you are a programmer, \u201dapptivist\u201d, please consider reaching out and connect your apps to our ecosystem via API or help us build an open ecosystem of related apps.</p>\n\n<p>If you know anyone who did not yet start to learn programming, please tell them to join us in <a href="http://gitter.im/codingamigos/learners" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://gitter.im/codingamigos/learners" rel="nofollow noopener">http://gitter.im/codingamigos/learners</a> so they can get started for free immediately. We offer 24/7 support for free to get learners from zero to be able to create their first mobile app within a couple of weeks up to a few months given learners are disciplined and learn full time.</p>\n\n<p>And last but not least, if you can bring in paid IT projects to support our voluntary efforts, the community of learners and our effort to prototype alternative ways of organizing and working together, we would appreciate it a lot. Everyone who successfully brings in a project and helps us communicating with the customer during the project will be transparently included in the sharing of the revenue.</p>\n\n<p><em>The production of this article was supported by <a href="/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296">Op3n Fellowships</a> - an ongoing program for community contributors during May - November 2016.</em></p>\n\n<p>Links:</p>\n\n<p>RefugeesWork - <a href="http://www.refugeeswork.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.refugeeswork.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Online JavaScript school - <a href="http://www.wizardamigos.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.wizardamigos.com</a></p>\n\n<p>Coding Amigos meetup - <a href="http://www.meetup.com/codingamigos" rel="nofollow noopener">www.meetup.com/codingamigos</a></p>\n\n<p>Coding Amigos collective - <a href="http://www.codingamigos.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.codingamigos.com</a></p>\n\n<p>SquatUp - <a href="https://github.com/SquatUp/projects/blob/master/README.md" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/SquatUp/projects/blob/master/README.md</a></p>\n\n<p>Nina Breznik - <a class="mention" href="/u/ninabreznik">@ninabreznik</a></p>\n\n<p>Alexander Praetorius - <a class="mention" href="/u/serapath">@serapath</a></p>', u'post_id': 769, u'user_id': 3396, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-28 23:06:30', u'title': u'RefugeesWork: programming skills for a new generation of freelancers to change the ecosystem and how we work together'}, {u'content': u'<p><b>Background</b></p>\n\n<p>There are tons of reasons that makes baby cries.

Being Greece\'s second biggest city, and the largest city of the country\'s North, Thessaloniki boasts with life, with a vibrant culture that is merging optimally the city\'s laid back flair, with its\xa0rich history, the university\xa0community and contemporary culture. In the last years, Thessaloniki is emerging as a lively incubator of several grassroots initiatives. The first urban gardening projects of Greece happened here, when a group of citizens occupied a former army camp. Social enterprises, consumers networks, activist groups\xa0and a significant arts scene are here at home.</p>\n\n<p>The workshop took place on September 3rd, 2016, inviting socially active citizens in the wider field of care.\xa0In many cases, these people are not strangers to each other. The city is neither too big, nor\xa0too small, and people that care are often meeting each other in the numerous gatherings, events and activities organised at the grassroots.</p>\n\n<p>\u03a4he workshop offered an open space to meet and discuss, using several tools\xa0for harnessing collective intelligence.\xa0Using various participatory methodologies, such as World Caf\xe9, participants mapped out the status quo, how they would imagine Care in Greece in 10 years from now, while engaging into framing this transition.</p>\n\n<p><b>Mapping the status quo</b></p>\n\n<p>The current care system of Greece is characterised by mainstream centralised structures defined (and accepted) by the public health system, marked by chronic problems related to inefficiency, corruption and lack of funding. The severity of the ongoing financial crisis in Greece has further incapacitated the public care system, but it has given rise to a milieu of social, citizen-led projects who leverage volunteerism to care for the most under-privileged parts of the society.</p>\n\n<p>Besides public hospitals and private clinics, these structures harbour initiatives ranging from non-profit actions\xa0by international and domestic NGOs or philanthropic organisations (including the church), to volunteer initiatives and informal groups. Over the last years, such initiatives have focused on the distribution of primary need goods (ie. clothes, food, education), based on a strong narrative around the solidarity and exchange economy. In parallel with citizen-led initiatives, many city councils have launched municipal Social\xa0Grocery\xa0stores or Pharmacies. In many cases, local community action is combined with public social structures.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/b7895260d1c3ea708438bd82d25b036f28c52cc9" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b7895260d1c3ea708438bd82d25b036f28c52cc9.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Care10yrs.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b7895260d1c3ea708438bd82d25b036f28c52cc9_1_666x500.jpg" width="666" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Care10yrs.jpg</span><span class="informations">2048x1536 324 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>Citizen imagine Care in Greece in 10 years</strong></p>\n\n<p>Citizens were asked to engage into collaborative dialogue on the future of care in Greece, using the World Caf\xe9 method. Participants were divided in two groups and shared ideas on different and multi-level care structures. People from one group swapped with the other, in oder to cross-polinate their knowledge which was later harvested to reveal interesting connnections between different aspects of care.</p>\n\n<p>The new paradigm focuses on synergies at different levels, putting emphasis on notions and ideas that bring people together, build trust, strengthen relationships in communities. From the level of housing,\xa0neighbourhoods and\xa0schools, all the way to managing structures of public health and social care. Interesting ideas were shared from participants, for example how we can train care stuff in novel and specialised approaches such as "preventive" mourning. Others talk of the need for communal spaces in blocks of flat, where residents can share tools or creative moments, enhancing social interaction in the buildings they live.</p>\n\n<p>For the participants, the future of care innovation\xa0is closely connected to openess and the availability of public space. Not surprisingly, many people appreciated the power of urban gardening in offering green spaces, but also in building a sense of community in the neighbourhood.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/3a21d9a997a1370082ddc98f72c4f52b37704cc8" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3a21d9a997a1370082ddc98f72c4f52b37704cc8.png" class="lightbox" title="OPENandChange_Graphs.002_0.png"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/3a21d9a997a1370082ddc98f72c4f52b37704cc8_1_666x500.png" width="666" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">OPENandChange_Graphs.002_0.png</span><span class="informations">1024x768 124 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>The transition to such a system is not without obstacles, especially by virtue of the lack of political sense in the crisis-stricken country that is experiencing the deepest recession since World War II.

As pioneers of a new action based, co-operative learning we share our special talents and skills with those interested. We are convinced that sustainable social change in the global community depends on the quality of personal development, training and the ability to effectively and constructively communicate with others. The focus is on interaction and cooperation, shared responsibility and authority, and the improvement of critical thinking. There is no \'teacher\' in the traditional sense. Learning will be self-organizing, dynamically adjusted to needs and ideas of the "learners".</div>\n</div>', u'post_id': 765, u'user_id': 3414, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-27 19:18:09', u'title': u'A holistic, integral, evolutionary, self-directed and self-integrated community'}, {u'content': u'<p>Imagine the City started in 2009 aiming to redefine the processes and relationships that shape the image and experience of contemporary Greek cities. An informal, open team of young people interested in design and architecture started to host weekly meetings to discuss issues such as: What are the criteria that define public works in Greek cities? Why do public spaces and urban environments in our country not reflect the creative human potential we have in the fields of design, architecture, and urban planning? How can we change the way citizens interact with and take care of the public space?</p>\n\n<p>In the past 7 years, the project has created a social platform in physical spaces, where citizens have the opportunity to be informed, discuss and consider the possibilities of improving their quality of life and imagine their city in a different way, with the higher aim to participate in decision-making processes about urban infrastructure and public works. Imagine the City develops public exhibitions in different Greek cities in which local architects, designers, urban planners and artists showcase their proposals, ideas, solutions, and plans for each city, enhanced by a series of parallel urban events.</p>\n\n<p>After the success of the first exhibition in the city of Chalkis in 2009, instead of accepting invitations to organize similar exhibitions in other cities, we created a digital manual documenting our experience, tools and guidelines, which was made openly available to other local teams to use and develop. The result is that Imagine the City has organically been developed in 13 Greek cities by interdisciplinary teams that bring together local authorities, businesses, universities and civil society groups. Exhibitions have hosted over 400 proposals by 650 creators. Two hundred parallel events have taken place and over 100.000 citizens have participated in the different activities. The manual is being evolved and includes from branding guidelines to fundraising and public engagement tips.</p>\n\n<p>The exhibits consist of material that participants have developed as students and researchers in the framework of academic projects in Greece or abroad, or as professionals with a social responsibility or interest to promote their work. The proposals suggest aesthetic and functional improvements of cultural, touristic or environmental importance through sketches, videos, and 3D models. The parallel urban events are developed exclusively for each city, focusing on the dissemination of information, knowledge, and perceptions to the local community, encouraging the participation of youth and children to experimental efforts to transform the urban space. Through debates, presentations, workshops and urban interventions we release knowledge about urban development, shed light on unknown sides of each city and create common ground for new partnerships to emerge at the local level. \xa0The trans-local and self-organised character of Imagine the City has activated the dynamic involvement of academic and public institutions, formal and informal teams, local businesses and simple citizens.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the discussions on local issues, Imagine the City has provoked a public dialogue of the political decision-making and planning processes in Greece, it has questioned the way we inhabit public spaces and has promoted a different urban culture in which citizens propose, evaluate, co-decide, activate and take care of the public space.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the community created the ground for a series of spin-off projects: From<a href="http://www.ideatopos.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">\xa0IDEATOPOS</a>, the first panhellenic conference on Place Marketing and Branding to<a href="http://placeidentity.gr/en/tag/synoikia-pittaki/" rel="nofollow noopener">\xa0SynOikia Pittaki</a>, a participatory light installation that became a landmark of Athens, to<a href="http://politeia2.org/?lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener">\xa0Politeia 2.0</a>, a platform for political innovation to redesign the Greek Constitution from the bottom-up. The need to scale up these projects led to the creation of the non-profit organization<a href="http://placeidentity.gr/en/" rel="nofollow noopener">\xa0Place Identity</a>, which acts as a cluster of projects for urban regeneration and political innovation.</p>\n\n<p>I initiated Imagine the City as a young designer interested in strategic and participatory design. Since then, it has evolved from a \u201cthink tank\u201d to a \u201cplatform\u201d to a \u201ctrans-local community\u201d. Myself, as the initial \u201ccaller\u201d and \u201cfacilitator\u201d and other people that got involved in the project coordination, allowed for systematic experimentation and risk-taking. The collectives that gradually joined our mission gave an unexpected dynamic to the project. Every now and then, we attempted to identify and showcase the ingredients and values that released creativity and joy within our network, causing a multiplier effect in local communities.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the years, we experienced many difficult moments and failures which nevertheless shaped our success. When we failed to gain official partnerships with Municipalities and Universities, we decided to reach directly to the academics, students, and citizens. When we failed to launch the digital Imagine the City platform, we decided to focus on the relationships and processes that are required in the physical space and it turned out this served our local teams better. Every collective challenge can become a step to a new collective insight and result in practical social innovation.</p>\n\n<p>In order to change the image and the experience of a city, you have to observe an entire system and not be afraid by its complexity. You need to face the public procurement processes for urban works, architecture competitions, political decision-making and the separation of powers. You need to rethink your role as the citizen, to understand deeply how a Democracy ought to function, to establish the political rights that you are not aware of. Otherwise, the city (polis) becomes an arena of conflicting material and psychological interests and soon gets out of control.</p>\n\n<p>Through communities of care that work for a common cause, you learn how to trust the other, and thus one\u2019s self. Unfortunately, in our country, we show to one another and to our society more suspicion and blame than trust and empathy. Maybe we keep reflecting society whatever we fail to manage within us. Maybe this is why Greek society still fails to \u201cgrow up\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>A community of change can only be facilitated if you are open, transparent and if you manage to demonstrate collective audacity while remaining the custodian of a team\u2019s shared values. When success triggers humility and difficulties spark evolution.</p>\n\n<p>If you ask me about the future of Imagine the City, personally, I would like it to see it evolve into something I cannot even imagine today, just the way I could not imagine the way it would evolve to date since we first started. I wish it could catalyze holistic solutions for the challenges faced by contemporary cities. As for now, Imagine the City has reached the closure of a first cycle. Interest from new cities to join has decreased significantly and those teams that have been activated in the past are unable to scale their activities without systematic organizational and financial support. Due to the financial crisis, local businesses cannot afford financial or in-kind sponsorships to fund urban activities. At the same time, larger sponsors are not interested in supporting projects in smaller cities due to limited promotion opportunities. However, there is a growing interest in research and training opportunities related to Imagine the City and the processes that could truly empower and scale our trans-local community.</p>\n\n<p>We are considering to launch the Imagine the City Academy: a trans-local training program that will support local interdisciplinary teams who develop prototype urban regeneration projects focusing on citizens\u2019 engagement. Building on past experience and existing local teams, we wish to promote action research on new models of managing public works to design holistic solutions that respond to the real needs of cities and local communities. The Academy could offer administrative, educational and financial support for local teams to exchange know-how, apply participatory tools, develop policy proposals and materialize prototype urban interventions. This program has been budgeted at 270.000\u20ac for a period of 5 years. The first year would focus on mapping the results and analyzing the needs of local teams so far, as well as process design for the program. The second would entail an open call, dissemination campaign and activation of cross-sector partnerships at the local level. The actual training program and project development phase of local projects would be in years 3 and 4. In the last year, we would evaluate results of local projects and make participatory policy proposals to tackle the systemic issues that suffocate creativity and participation in urban planning in Greece.</p>\n\n<p>I work as a freelance designer and have a small company,<a href="http://www.theswitch.gr/index.php/en/" rel="nofollow noopener">\xa0theSwitch</a>, which I co-founded in 2005 with a group of friends. While working on branding and designing professional spaces, I started working on methodologies of strategic and participatory design and I got involved in a series of social projects. In social projects, by design, I try to apply principles of self-organisation, self-sufficiency, sustainability, and independent financing but for the moment I cannot claim that I have managed to achieve the results I aim for\u2026 I think that in our country it is even more difficult due to the financial breakdown and the close networks of power. Often, sponsorships tend to manipulate projects or connect them to certain political agendas. We have also experienced funding programs that can destroy something truly innovative through their bureaucratic mechanisms or to make it easier for society to digest. I consider as my main personal goal to be professional, financially and politically independent so as to be open to collaboration, respecting a predefined set of values and encouraging substantial progress.</p>\n\n<p>My involvement in public affairs started from my teenage years, in the city where I grew up where I was part of the scout\'s community and a student magazine team. I have spent innumerable hours volunteering in my life, yet I am against \u201cvolunteering\u201d as an end in itself, or as a \u201cculture\u201d that apparently needs to be cultivated. I believe that Greece was never short of \u201cphilotimo\u201d (love of honor) and \u201cmeraki\u201d (love in doing), solidarity and social care actions. However organized civil society is not recognized in our constitution and our institutions, its positive impact neither being acknowledged nor encouraged.</p>\n\n<p>What we need to cultivate today is a culture of holistic and creative problem-solving. Communities do not need volunteers but of citizens committed to solving problems \u2013 not just pointing out issues and ideas! I mean, solving problems in practice. If we do not take the responsibility of applying what we believe in, even in pilot projects, if we do not create new paradigms and do not experience political maturity, then we can keep talking politics (\u201cpolitika\u201d) but we cannot live as citizens (\u201cpolites"). Before sticking to political identities and ideologies, we need to achieve political rights and the freedom that will enable mixed policy and governance models. Instead of allowing closed networks of power to define our lives, these governance models could facilitate communities of action for the common good and the interests of the Polis.</p>', u'post_id': 540, u'user_id': 1086, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-22 12:19:44', u'title': u'Facilitating communities of action for the common good and the interests of the Polis'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 542, u'user_id': 3380, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-28 16:36:35', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p>We are the families of the "Oltrarno", the other or wrong side of the Arno river in Florence, Italy.</p>\n\n<p>Facing a tough challenge - surviving in the Disneyland of the Renaissance, as a community.</p>\n\n<p>Right behind the Carmine church, where the Renaissance was born,\xa0families of the most varied background - both traditional and immigrant - run a garden which was donated to the population of the district by the American Red Cross in 1920 and has since been largely seized by a real estate speculator.</p>\n\n<p>A cross-section of ordinary people of every kind, who are beginning to work together to develop new ways of survival, friendship and beauty\xa0in an era where the "state" is no longer the key actor.</p>\n\n<p>As we discover our own needs, our strength, the power of working together, we find that we have a whole world of prospects before us, something much larger than the garden we started out with.</p>\n\n<p>We are here to listen and to learn, and of course we would be glad to show you around our side of Florence, should you ever drop by!</p>', u'post_id': 766, u'user_id': 3439, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-28 11:00:58', u'title': u'Surviving as a community among the tourist flood in Florence'}, {u'content': u'<p><strong>Discover our initiative in <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11CyVAt-zi4JrEKac8qSZEndXUDkbTveU3VzLYXjnJhU/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=10000" rel="nofollow noopener">ten visual slides</a>!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Breathing Games (<a href="http://www.breathinggames.net" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://www.breathinggames.net" rel="nofollow noopener">www.breathinggames.net</a>) promotes respiratory health by encouraging each citizen to take care of their health.

The publication will be made available in Kathmandu at no cost to the residents to assure wide dissemination of its data to a diverse communities. It also will be available in the United States and sold as a way to fund other parts of this project and future projects. A link to this finished book is available on this website.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>C. <a href="http://www.bagmatiriverartproject.com/videos/bagmati/" rel="nofollow noopener">a documentary video</a> will document the project and include interviews with water quality and health professionals, community members as well a policy maker in Kathmandu. Songs by traditional Nepalese folk singers are incorporated throughout the video including a commissioned song about the Bagmati River. A link to this finished documentary is available on this website.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>D. a brochure and poster written in Nepalese will also provide important accessible scientific and health data about the river. The poster and brochures will be distributed to the communities that live along the entire length of the river in Nepal. Members of the Bagmati River Expedition 2015 team, who created a comprehensive report about the river\u2019s water quality, microinvertebrates, avian population and plastics data, have already established connections in these communities. We are working with Sujan Chitrakar and his graphic design students in designing the posters and brochures. Sujan is the Academic Program Coordinator and an Assistant Professor for Kathmandu University\u2019s School of Art, Center for Art and Design.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>All elements of the project listed above will be finished and presented at the opening of the exhibition in November 20, 2016 when Jason and I plan to return to Kathmandu.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>An exciting extension to this project is the plan to ship the artwork, publication, documentary, brochures and posters back to the United States where it will tour around the country and, possibly, internationally. Water issues are a worldwide concern and the Bagmati\u2019s perils are not unique. Our hope is that, by touring the exhibition and by combining it with site-specific exhibitions, audiences can create connections between their region and other global communities. There is a good deal that can be learned from the history of the Bagmati as well as from the grass roots efforts that created the Saturday Bagmati River clean-up program and the successful community health initiatives supported by the non-government organizations. All of these efforts has unified the underserved residents of the Kathmandu Valley to address the basic needs in their communities while creating hope and motivating government involvement.\xa0\xa0</span></p>\n\n<p><span>The Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo, New York is very interested in the merits of the project and they have volunteered to promote and organize the touring exhibition.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>For more information please contact <a href="mailto:alberto@albertorey.com"><span>alberto@albertorey.com</span></a>.</span></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Project Leaders</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Alberto Rey</strong> \u2013 Distinguished Professor in the Department of Visual Arts and New Media at the State University of New York at Fredonia, Director and Founder of S.A.R.E.P.

Since about 10 years ago, food activism raised as our generations Woodstock, something that some of us like to call \u201cFoodstock\u201d. Therefore, the lines between political activism and an academic life started becoming very thin, and in times it felt -indeed- awkward to interact with two environments that hardly communicated to each other. Maybe for a good reason.</p>\n\n<p>In 2007, I travelled to India for the first time, to do my MSc thesis in the Central Indian Himalayan belt, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.navdanya.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Navdanya</a>, an NGO founded by renowned food and seeds activist, Dr. Vandana Shiva. In 2008, <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Local-Plant-Knowledge-Livelihoods-Ethnobotanical/dp/382361519X" rel="nofollow noopener">I published my first book</a> on human-plant relations of tribal hill communities on the noble mountains of the Garhwal Himalaya. At the same time, returning to my university in Stuttgart, Germany, I helped found <a href="https://fresh.uni-hohenheim.de" rel="nofollow noopener">F.R.E.S.H. - the Food Revitalisation &amp; Ecogastronomic Society of Hohenheim</a>.</p>\n\n<p>F.R.E.S.H. was one of the very first student initiatives in Europe, trying to engage young agricultural students in a new, holistic, and self-reflective thinking about the future of the food system. We organised conferences, peaceful protests against unsustainable practices in the university\u2019s canteens, a student garden and we even designed and fundraised for a new academic module on the Ethics of Food &amp; Nutrition Security. Through community work in the campus, a group of young students from more than 15 countries from around the world, started building these much needed bridges between analytical thinking and solving the world\u2019s problems.</p>\n\n<p>Around this time, in 2008, I attended Slow Food\u2019s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWlBg9nr-HE" rel="nofollow noopener">Terra Madre</a> in Turin. This was a game changer, which allowed my friends and me see the wider picture, and to connect with hundreds of other youth. We saw the rise of the urban gardening movement and the food waste movement. We spoke of the need for intergenerational renewal in the agricultural sector, and we started connecting the dots. For us, good food and good farming almost became an obsession, and a latent hope that maybe we can manage to improving the world, by improving our food and our quality of life.</p>\n\n<p>At the same year, still a student in Germany and doing my ethnobotanical research for my PhD in India, Thailand and China, I founded a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/slowfood.thrace" rel="nofollow noopener">Slow Food Convivium in Thrace</a>, my home land in Northern Greece. Well before the financial crisis and the social havoc it evoked hit home, we started discussing about resilience, an organic transition, urban gardens, quality food production/consumption systems. Early days for such ideas in Greece, this action has raised plenty of scepticism, as no-one would expect what was coming. Our actions ranged from organising public social meals in squares in streets, campaigns, food fairs, etc. I have organised three delegations of small Greek producers to Slow Food fairs in Italy and Germany, and as the crisis was unfolding, I wanted to show that a difference Greece exists -other than the one presented by the media and blamed by politicians- and it was here.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In 2012, I produced an award winning short documentary, called \u201c<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/foodpolitics" rel="nofollow noopener">Farming on Crisis?</a>\u201d. This was the untold story of the Greek countryside, unfolding through a man\'s journey across the crisis-stricken country, uncovering the stories of young farmers and the prospects of revamping the economy through good farming and sustainable rural development. Building a bridge between the small and the large; the urban and the rural; the local with the global, the film used the case of Greece in order to touch urgent global challenges like food security, the environment and the future of our food. This movie travelled around the world, screened in several film festivals and opened a new dialogue: what future can we hope for, with only 6% of Europe\u2019s farmers under the age of 35? We even got an award in Hollywood.</p>\n\n<p>As my life proceeded into this environment, I started venturing into good food entrepreneurship. From one side, I was launching global petitions for a better agricultural food system, to be presented at Rio+20, on the other hand I started discussing with my parents plans about revamping our family\u2019s traditional olive grove in Northern Greece. At 2012, we created <a href="http://www.calypsotree.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Calypso</a>, a single varietal extra virgin olive oil made inside the ancient grove of my small village, Makri. Our purpose was (and still is), not only to produce a product of the utmost quality, but to champion <a href="http://www.arc2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/arc2020-brochure-5-with-hyperlinks.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">innovative agroecological practices</a>, trying to invite more farmers of the region in our journey towards sustainable quality. Soon after, I joined forces with another Italian friend from my former Slow Food years, and then we joined by another one, and another one, and we created <a href="http://www.wedelivertaste.com" rel="nofollow noopener">We Deliver Taste</a>. This is a small consultancy company connecting agriculture with gastronomy, hospitality and marketing. We are consulting good farmers and help them access new markets, while working with restaurant owners and chefs in order to close the loops in the \u201cbroken food system\u201d that we all new is a major part of the problem. This is of utmost importance for <a href="/t/transforming-food-systems-in-post-crisis-greece-conversation-with-pavlos-georgiadis-part-one/669">Greece and its post-crisis future</a>,\xa0 since the country has one of the largest per capita agricultural populations in Europe. We are now establishing new partnerships, working with ICT developers and experimenting on open data systems, with the aim of creating tools that bring more transparency and education in food supply chains, and shorten them in terms of communication and enhanced interaction among all peers.</p>\n\n<p>Having experienced these transformation at the personal and social level, I still continue doing a lot of community research in Greece. To me, my country has emerged as a testing ground for <a href="/t/greece-as-a-hot-spot-of-transformative-future-conversation-with-pavlos-georgiadis-part-2/671">a new transformative future</a>, what I like to call the \u201cPlan C\u201d. That is, if the \u201cPlan A\u201d is a Grexit, and \u201cPlan B\u201d is a devastating bankruptcy, then I think there is also space to investigate the possibility for another plant. <a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/2015/08/time-to-work-out-a-plan-c-for-greece/" rel="nofollow noopener">The \u201cPlan C\u201d has to do with the design of a roadmap for advancing towards a real transition back to the Commons</a>, based on civil engagement for participatory mapping and collective management of the assets that influence what is currently under attack: the everyday lives of the people.</p>\n\n<p>Inspired by the many different communities on the rise throughout the country, and concerned about the lack of resources and the disconnection between them, #BackToCommons is my latest project. This is not an organisation (I don\u2019t think there is a need to be one - there are so many organisations which we work with), but rather an informal network of young researchers who are trying to pull resources for creating systemic infrastructure in Greece. The aim is to give a new hope to a desperate society, but also connect this action with the world, knowing that a lot of people in the ground don\u2019t have access to resources, due to many known barriers. Lack of funds and language are only two of them.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure where the journey of #BackToCommons is going to end, but I am convinced that it is heading towards the right direction. More and more people in Greece start believing on the power of commons-based action, and what is considered an \u201calternative\u201d in other, more affluent economies of Europe in the world, over here is pretty much the only way forward. Despite the discontent, this offers a significant opportunity for working out transition solutions that I am sure are going to prove very useful for the international community.</p>\n\n<p>I know that given the political, organisational and financial support, realising this type of transition is\xa0 one of the few chances we have in order to achieving the very possibility of realising the Sustainable Development Goals and the objectives mapped out at COP21. More importantly, as extremism is on the rise across the continent, what is needed more than ever before, are new narratives that connect our societies - not separate them. And in the absence of political sense, I think that we the people can still continue building them.</p>', u'post_id': 543, u'user_id': 3338, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-29 09:33:55', u'title': u'#BackToCommons: Building new narratives that connect our societies - not separate them'}, {u'content': u'<p>My name is Jenny Gkiougki and I am one of those Greeks that went back home <em>during </em>the crisis. (For an account of how I came about this decision and my take on the crisis please follow <a href="/en/crisis-what-crisis-the-journey-back-to-my-eco-roots#comment-25934">this link</a> here on Edgeryders) During my residence abroad I was working as a business consultant and marketer. After ten years, I decided to return to my Greece to contribute to the local community and help with the bringing about of change. I am currently (amongst others) working on a project called \u201cReal Food Utopia\u201d as a co-facilitator with a foreign research partner, dealing with the mapping of alternative food systems in the region of Thessaloniki. (For a full list of all the projects I\'m working on currently and the great and exciting things we are creating in Greece and in EU and links to many of them <a href="/t/from-eco-activism-to-food-sovereignty-and-beyond/527">please look here at another of my posts).</a></p>\n\n<p>The workshops of the project are related to alternative economies, peri-urban gardening, refugees and food through a participatory procedure between people who belong to informal initiatives all around the city. This procedure also includes training in participatory video making and working on all its processes (ie. storyboards, editing) in order to create audiovisual material and share the technique with everyone who is interested in it.</p>\n\n<p>I am a member of the URGENCI International Network of Community Supported Agriculture, the European Research Group on CSA, and the European Movement for Food Sovereignty. I have been working as an activist on matters related to Food Sovereignty for 5 years and I am currently cooperating with a team of another three more advocates to create a legal entity to represent grassroots initiatives. In the near future, we would like to expand our network through an open call all over Greece and reclaim our existing collaborations and good synergies abroad.</p>\n\n<p>I am interested in self-sustainability and viable solutions with regards to how we live and thrive and hence I beleive that the future lies in the creation of new types of communities, ecovillages etc, and the promotion of practices like permaculture and the blue economy model of zero emissions that can create self-sufficient farmers and viable, circular economies that not only do not pollute, but actually create more resources instead of depleting them.\xa0 I am trying to encourage Greek people to be more involved in Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) schemes, to share risks with their farmers during the cultivating season and create a new concept of human relationship within the community they interact with. Additionally, the enhancement of CSA would support small-scale farmers who lack access to the local market and cannot (should not) get involved in complex food chains.</p>\n\n<p>We would like to address the needs of small-scale farmers who wish to obtain access to European food markets at fair prices, but also consumers of all ages who become more conscious about food production and consumption. I would like to engage in interactive campaigns and seminars that target informal collectivities who are interested in food sovereignty, but lack financial resources and technical support. Our community project will form a new hub that will host them and their projects.</p>\n\n<p>We are interested in creating a new agricultural production model in Greece, focusing on agroecology and self-sufficiency in the context of land and food management, considering limiting factors such as economic hardship. All in all, we pursue the transition to a new way of thinking and living through an \u201cumbrella\u201d project which consists of several innovative schemes.</p>\n\n<p>The main scope of the project is to empower rural farmers and inspire rural lifestyle, by combining traditions and technology, based on the principles of permaculture. We wish to enhance small-scale agriculture, in order to revive Greece\u2019s rural areas and promote an economy that is based on social solidarity and alternative currencies.</p>\n\n<p>What we have in mind is summarized in the following fields of action:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tExporting network of agricultural products in Northern Europe (especially citrus, olive oil and \u201cugly\u201d fruits) that are produced by small-scale farmers to solidarity collectivities at fair prices.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tPromotion of food security and food sovereignty in Greece.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tRespond to the mainstream challenges by using our ingenuity and creativity for social \u2013nonpersonal- benefits.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tReduce food waste promoting \u201cugly\u201d fruits and vegetables focusing on good quality.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tBoost local economies and offer technical support to Community Supported Agriculture schemes.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tCreation of an official Greek hub for non formal groups working on food sovereignty that lack financial support.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tSaving of Greek agricultural land from the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund and ensuring its utilization through concession or purchase by our group in the context of communal ownership.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Increase awareness and educate farmers and consumers in order to become more conscious through seminars, campaigns and training sessions about sustainable farming methods and consumption patterns.

Being an adjunct professor lecturing Sociology of health at the University of Parma I have a good starting point - not exactly a healthcare expert person, but a sociologist with a huge passion for e-learning and innovation in education, working on the change from within.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>My idea is that the change should take place in the training and education sphere about how professionals and practitioners become such. Innovation and openness of knowledge must become the cutting edge paradigm within universities, hospitals and healthcare policies.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>I\u2019ve been granted research scholarships for the past years and I use them to bring change in two main areas of education: technologies and practices of innovation. It\u2019s about bringing these two aspects, also existing in collaborative economies, communities, in hacker groups and activists promoting open access to knowledge, data and technology to stubborn, hermetic ecosystems of higher education. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>My current project, a weblab named Puntozero (</span><a href="http://puntozero.github.io/" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://puntozero.github.io/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://puntozero.github.io/</a>)<span>, explores the ways in which teachers, professors, tutors and students -used to the traditional model of lecturing a class and equipping people with theoretical knowledge and in-field training- might integrate in a community of practice to innovate the way of learning. This year there are about 150 students involved. The brainstorming about proposals include more talking to the patients, who want to collaborate and surely want to see medicine more friendly, more efficient, more human. It is important to change the way we see health care - not as a prestigious, restricted profession for a selected group of professional, but as a practice that has been there for thousands of years, a huge amount of collective wisdom that pioneered and support what we call medicine and care right now. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>It\u2019s fascinating to play with the idea of a healthcare student classroom where, instead of feeding people with theories, teachers would create space where students meet makers of all sorts and discuss various technological innovations with them, and spend time with their patients, getting hands on experience in various cases. By encouraging sharing of data, more interdisciplinary collaboration, creativity and networking educational institutions could create a new breed of health professionals. Their work style would be more inclusive and horizontal, and they would be more interested in critical thinking and discussion, sharing and transparency. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>At the moment I\u2019m working with a couple of small innovations that could lead to improved communication between health professionals and patients. One of them is about involving three trainees in archiving and developing a set of health-related </span><span>caremojis</span><span>, accessible in a open, less formal exchange, a tool improving communication and adoption of symbols to represent concepts of concern (e.g.: surgery tools, health conditions, symptoms, etc..). They will be soon ready to be used and evaluated by the students. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>Another one is to replace yearly reports from traineeship by an online book, accessible to everyone and encouraging discussion. And it actually did. While i was working as professor I also skipped preparing tests and asked each pupil to come up with one multiple choice question, and out of 150 of them, were chosen random 20 questions set that became the test I made an exam. It was a very democratic, surprising step for students. I tend to be also available online for my students as much as possibile and I put a lot of stress on digital learning and Open Educational Resources (OER) - to save paper, to spare their pockets, to promote more openness, to bring more p2p learning. Finally, I try to skip the usage of huge, expensive books in the classrooms - instead, I look for good, open source materials, and if they\u2019re in English, I ask my students to translate one page each and put it up in Italian as a wiki, available to everyone. There are all these ways in which students are forced to meet and talk, an essential practice, widely absent in the formal education. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>I\u2019m interested in joining the OPENandchange with the mission of tweaking and/or revolutionizing the classroom and the health care education and training. I want to create more opportunities for students to meet people who change the way care is given in different ways - by making devices, by creating informal institutions, in fablabs and elderly houses. I want to prepare workshops where makers and patients would be working along the health care providers on new solutions. And I want to empower alternative ways of giving care, outside of the formal profession, initiatives driven by values other than money - by the idea of being helpful, virtue of serving each other, and actual engagement. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>Therefore i would like to engage other scholars, makers, educators, archivists, patients and who else inspired by an open paradigm of healthcare in contributing to a p2p learning project to advance healthcare professions curricula and innovate where possibile and to open knowledge filed the higher education for healthcare professions.

Evasive entrepreneurship refers to circumventing institutional obstacles as part of novel activity. It is not illegal: it\u2019s done by using new technologies, finding room in existing regulations or working in the gray zone. If successful, it can make the institution being sidestepped irrelevant, or even provoke reform by highlighting its inefficiency. Evasive entrepreneurship is potentially a tool that can aid institutional reform in Europe, in particular in areas where institutions are obsolete or ineffective but where political reform is slow in response.</p>\n\n<p>I use this framework to discuss how initiatives which stem from communities can bring about change. An example used to illustrate this is the Helliniko Metropolitan Community Clinic in Greece, a large volunteer effort which provides health care to low-income patients. The self-organized clinic referred to as the people\u2019s<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/vijoleta-gordeljevic/how-greeks-built-their-own-health-system_b_8238210.html" rel="nofollow noopener"> \u201cAlternative Health System\u201d</a> has served thousands of patients parallel to the existing (but ill functioning) health care system.</p>\n\n<p>All this is nothing new. Economic and social development often results from entrepreneurs responding to problems or opportunities and enacting change. While high-tech business firms are everyone\u2019s favourite example, this entrepreneurship need not be profit-driven nor abide by existing rules.</p>\n\n<p>Institutional entrepreneurship refers to how entrepreneurs are influenced by and influence institutions. It is a field that greatly interest me. Entrepreneurship typically refers to business activity. More fundamentally however it includes all innovative activities aimed at change, not only firms. Other categories include \u201csocial entrepreneurs\u201d who create non-profit organizations, <a href="https://books.google.se/books/about/Who_Governs.html?id=-L99RHLc3WoC&amp;redir_esc=y" rel="nofollow noopener">\u201cpolitical entrepreneurs\u201d</a> who recombine resources in the policy arena to bring about reform and <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5613.html" rel="nofollow noopener">\u201ccommunity entrepreneurs\u201d</a> who organize to provide local public goods.</p>\n\n<p>According to Schumpeter, the defining characteristic of entrepreneurship is not earning profits but disrupting the current equilibrium \u2013 the \u201corder of things\u201d inherited from the past. Business entrepreneurs who change the market equilibrium with new technologies, products or organizations are one important group, but the term can be applied to other actions which bring about dynamic change.</p>\n\n<p>This post discusses these concepts theoretically as well as giving examples of how specific projects can be viewed within this framework.</p>\n\n<p>A case illustrating political entrepreneurship is the <a href="http://participedia.net/en/cases/rahvakogu-peoples-assembly" rel="nofollow noopener">People\'s Assembly in Estonia</a>, an online platform for crowdsourcing ideas for reforming electoral and political laws. The public was free to suggest proposals, which were reviewed by experts and discussed by a randomly chosen assembly of a few hundred voters. The People\'s Assembly was initiated and organized by civil society voluntaries dissatisfied with democratic institutions in Estonia. It uses modern IT-tools to mimic classical democratic associations in smaller polities which allowed for face-to-face discussions and open proposals.</p>\n\n<p>One interesting example of \u201ccommunity entrepreneurship\u201d is <a href="http://prinzessinnengarten.net/about/" rel="nofollow noopener">Prinzessinnengarten</a>, a large urban garden in the middle of Berlin founded and managed by local volunteers. The garden was built in a poorer part of Berlin to experiment with green urban gardening but also as a social initiate. Both the Prinzessinnengarten and the People\'s Assembly are entrepreneurial in that they are novel responses to opportunity, but clearly not business firms.</p>\n\n<p>Social entrepreneurship was also the driving force behind several much larger institutions. The Swiss businessman Henry Dunant is not famous for his private investments but for founding of the Red Cross, for which he received the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize" rel="nofollow noopener">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 1901. More recent example of non-profit entrepreneurs includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales" rel="nofollow noopener">Jimmy Wales</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Sanger" rel="nofollow noopener">Larry Sanger</a> who in 2001 created Wikipedia. The Red Cross and Wikipedia were innovative initiatives which changed the world as much as any entrepreneurial firm and which also required novel ideas, alertness to opportunities, risk taking and organizational effort.</p>\n\n<p>The People\'s Assembly, Prinzessinnengarten, The Red Cross and Wikipedia are examples of novel and to various extents disruptive entrepreneurship, but not of evasive entrepreneurship. These are examples of innovations in practices, technology or organization carried out within the existing institutional framework.</p>\n\n<p>Entrepreneurs act within the rules of society we call institutions, sometimes defined as \u201cthe humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction\u201d. Formal written institutions include laws, property rights and regulations whereas informal unwritten institutions include as traditions, cultural practices and norms. In the last few years there have some interesting work on how institutions affect entrepreneurs and how entrepreneurs may in turn influence institutions. I have <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7951014" rel="nofollow noopener">previously written</a> about the interaction of entrepreneurship and institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Institutions such as property rights, rules, market structure, the political system and social norms largely regulate society and influence the extent to which entrepreneurial talent is directed toward productive or unproductive activity. Entrepreneurs can in turn work to abide, evade or alter institutions.</p>\n\n<p>The common response is to institutions and work whiting the current framework. Altering institutions can take the form of social activism aimed directly at influencing policy makers to reform laws and regulations, such as the environment movement. A perhaps more intriguing way in which entrepreneurs interact with institutions is through evasive entrepreneurship aimed at circumventing formal institutions. Unlike activism, evasive entrepreneurship is not aimed directly at changing institutions by influencing policy makers but at devising ways to work around them.</p>\n\n<p>One example includes rides-for-hire application companies such as Uber and Lyft which enable their users to circumvent regulations in the local taxi market. <a href="http://www.ifn.se/wfiles/wp/Wp1103.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Another example</a> aimed at circumventing intellectual property right and monopoly power includes file-sharing platforms such as The Pirate Bay. An important recent study by <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2513475" rel="nofollow noopener">Elert and Henrekson</a> discusses evasive entrepreneurship in depth:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA well-established idea in the entrepreneurship literature is that entrepreneurs generally abide by institutions, which are therefore seen as the main determinants of entrepreneurship and economic growth. We challenge this idea by providing the first formal definition of evasive entrepreneurship, and argue that it is an important yet underappreciated source of innovation and change in the economy, especially because evasive entrepreneurs through their actions in the market may spur institutional change with potentially important welfare effects\u2026This type of entrepreneurship is a means to test and provoke the existing institutional frameworks, and it also indirectly results in adaptations within those frameworks\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Social activism takes place in the policy arena and deals with unwanted institutions by creating opinion and influencing politicians to directly reforming the institution in question. Evasive entrepreneurship by contrast accepts the institution but devices method to de facto work around it in the real economy. Elert and Henrekson discuss the distinction:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUnlike institution-altering entrepreneurs, evasive entrepreneurs do not use political means to change institutions, but instead affect them through their activities in the market [...] they do not directly try to change institutions through political means at the higher levels of the institutional hierarchy\u201d</p>\n\n<p>An entrepreneur who devises clever ways to evade taxes by using tax-havens may cause harmful economic effects. An early definition of evasive entrepreneurship is efforts in \u201cevading the legal system or in avoiding the unproductive activities of other agents\u201d. Adam Smith had this figured out already in 1776. He wrote that individuals could circumvent institutional constraints unfavorable to commerce, and added that the effort of individuals to better their condition is \u201cnot only capable of carrying on the society to wealth and prosperity, but of surmounting a hundred impertinent obstructions with which the folly of human laws too often encumbers its operation\u2019\u2019.</p>\n\n<p>Elert and Henrekson agree. Evasion can be both a bad and a good thing, depending on the specifics.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf evasive entrepreneurship circumvents institutions that are welfare enhancing, it is likely to decrease welfare, but if there are other motives behind these institutions or if they have become obsolete (act as impediments) due to technical and/or organizational change, evasive entrepreneurship is likely to raise welfare\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It is more likely that evasive entrepreneurship act as a vehicle of regulatory change by provoking it when the institutions being evaded is obsolete or inefficient</strong>. In these cases, evasive entrepreneurship has the additional benefit of pointing to inconsistencies in regulation.</p>\n\n<p>Policy-makers may indeed welcome evasive entrepreneurship in many situations. The interest of politicians and society do not always perfectly coincide, for example in settings characterized by rent seeking, corruption, lobbying or group conflict. This can lead to institutional designed to further private interests of politicians or special interests despite being ineffective for society at large. Not all institutional inefficiency is however intentional. In other cases, inefficiency reflects complexity and the fact that optimal policies constantly shift due to technological and social change. In this situation,evasive entrepreneurship palys a Hayekian role by utilizing local information that is known in communities affected by policies but which policy makers in centralized decision making do not have full access to.</p>\n\n<p>Another major problem in devising institutions is uncertainty, not the least when dealing with new technologies. When there are large uncertainties, evasive entrepreneurs can serve as an educational source for policy makers by demonstrating by experimenting and testing boundaries, demonstrating on a smaller scale what works and what does not. This is particularly true when there are active communities which self-organize to actively bring knowledge to the surface. In recent years, policymakers have become more aware about the benefits of using self-organized communities as a source of smalls scale experimentation and innovation as a complement for large scale for bureaucracy. Many initiatives fail, but the cost of failure is small, unlike state activity, and easily outweighed by the gains from even a few successful experiments.</p>\n\n<p>An example of such innovative initiatives who I recently came into contact with is the tech community <a href="/t/about-edgeryders/447">Edgeryders</a>, which experiments with open access enterprises to deal with institutional failure in Europe. One fascinating case in evasive entrepreneurship which interested me is in the Greece health care sector.</p>\n\n<p>Health care provision is one of the major problems facing the economy. Studies in the field of health economics has documented the difficult problem of health inflation, where expenditure on health care consistently increases faster than the rest of the economy, which puts pressure on public and private finances in both the U.S and Europe. There are however few satisfactory answers to what can be done about this.</p>\n\n<p>The Greek health care system in addition collapsed following the economic crisis. Edgeryders works with a very interesting case study on evasive entrepreneurship in the Greek health care sector. Health care provision in Greece faces major difficulty following the financial crisis, with brought the public to the brink of bankruptcy and in addition led to many Greeks losing their jobs in a country where the national health service is tied to employment. This led to many unemployed Greeks losing their insurance virtually lacking access to public health care and no money to pay for private clinics.</p>\n\n<p>One response to institutional failure was Metropolitan Community Clinic, a self-organized initiative evading existing institutions to provide health care to those lacking health care. <a href="/t/care-by-communities-greeces-shadow-zero-cash-health-care-system/4880">Edgeryders write:</a>\xa0</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is a very strange animal as health care providers go. It has no legal existence. Its literature proudly proclaims: \u201cMCCH is a volunteer organization without Legal or Taxable status and it is not a \'Non-Profit-Making-Organisation\'.\u201d Maria: "We are technically illegal". It does not accept donations in money. It does accept donations in kind: medicines, equipment, blood sample analyses. It operates from a building that belongs to the Municipality of Helliniko-Argyropoulis. Though none of its employees works in the building, the Municipality still pays the electricity and phone bills that the MCCH generates\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Traditional economic theory might in the past have concluded that this arrangement is impossible, but work in New Institutional Economics by Elinor Ostrom and others have shown that self-organized governance systems can use norms, internal trust and reciprocity even when formal structures and property rights are lacking. The MCCH may serve as an illustration of Ostrom\'s Law: \u201cA resource arrangement that works in practice can work in theory\u201d</p>\n\n<p>There are apparently several similar health-care clinics in Greece circumventing the institutional framework as a response to policy failure. I find this an interesting example of evasive entrepreneurship, and plan to evaluate the MCCH as a case of evasive entrepreneurship as a response to institutional failure together with my college Erik Lakomaa. Elert and Henrekson in their study focus on for-profit evasive entrepreneurship, but conceptually nothing precludes non-profit evasive entrepreneurship.</p>\n\n<p>In discussed above, the benefits of evasive entrepreneurship are particularly important in situations when existing institutions do not function well, which makes Greece a suitable case study. This and other cases are interesting to evaluating if evasive entrepreneurship may be utilized to identify, resolve or reform obsolete institutions in Europe. \xa0</p>\n\n<p><em>Photo credit: Charles Knowles on flickr.com</em></p>', u'post_id': 509, u'user_id': 3165, u'timestamp': u'2016-06-20 22:42:36', u'title': u'Escaping failed institutions through evasive entrepreneurship'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 529, u'user_id': 3393, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-03 11:36:45', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/f0620e8ff7efc3c2261f54ed6c0356ab64fc7ea3" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f0620e8ff7efc3c2261f54ed6c0356ab64fc7ea3.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Timeline.002 low.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f0620e8ff7efc3c2261f54ed6c0356ab64fc7ea3_1_690x304.jpg" width="690" height="304"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Timeline.002 low.jpg</span><span class="informations">1014x447 113 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>About two months ago, we set out to convene a smart swarm of grassroots initiatives to renew health and social care. The idea was big and ambitious: <strong>cast <em>communities</em> \xa0as care providers, alongside the state and private business</strong>. We had decided to run for a 100 million dollars grant, the MacArthur\'s Foundation 100&amp;Change. But not as an organization. <strong>We would run as a smart swarm of grassroots initiatives around care</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>We have researched "care by communities" in the opencare project. We fancy ourselves experts in the field. But this new task was not research: it was design. How could all those independent local initiatives combine a in a tentative system-level solution? No way this could happen through scaling grassroots initiatives. They are so fast end efficient because they mobilize local resources: skills, mutual trust, capital, institutions. They should scale as far as these resources extend, but no further. No, what we needed was an ecosystem, an organic mosaic of local solutions. We needed to think like biologists, not like engineers.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>There was only one problem: you can\'t design an ecosystems. Ecosystems evolve. They are so fast, efficient, diverse and beautiful precisely <em>because</em> no one agency controls them. Hell, they <em>die</em> if you try to control them too tightly. So, we did not try to design care by community at scale. Instead, we designed a context that speeds up mutation, adaptation, exchange (both cultural and economic) and selection of grassroots initiatives. The key is to hardcode incentives for them to want to interact. With no interactivity there is no ecosystem; if it does not have links, it\'s not a network.</p>\n\n<p>I hate application forms just as much as the next guy, but this one was a lot of fun. <strong>It felt right, honest</strong>. It is so strange that we could see no point in trying to bullshit the judges into selecting us. We are proposing something different, and scary, and exciting. If they go for it, better they go with their eyes wide open.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>But there is something else that makes me think we are on the right track. This: <strong>everybody hates the grant cycle</strong>. <strong>It just does not work, and it has to go</strong>. Putting money on the table attracts the sharks as well as the good guys, and the sharks have an advantage: they don\'t care about the problems, they only need to please the grant giver.\xa0Grant givers know this, so they respond by putting in place rules and control systems to keep the sharks away. But of course the sharks mutate, camouflage. They go to the right conferences. They talk to funders. They pick up the exciting new concepts and ape them, turning them into hollow\xa0buzzwords. So the grant givers erect new barriers, and so on. The result is an arms race. The losers are the doers, who need to spend more and more time differentiating themselves from the parasites. Some of them even give up, focus more and more on getting the next grant, and become parasites themselves. In the grant cycle nobody can hear you scream.</p>\n\n<p>This won\'t happen in Open&amp;Change. For two reasons.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>First, there is no incentive to become a parasite. If we win, we win as a swarm. MacArthur will perceive the swarm, not the single organizations. Our best path to prosperity is to avoid mission drift, use the swarm to get our initiative off the ground, and never have to chase a grant again.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Second, we are not alone. We share the grant with hundreds of peers. They can and should be our partners, suppliers, clients, friends. <strong>The grant brings us together, instead of driving us apart in a competitive logic</strong>.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Against all the odds, I am quite upbeat about Open&amp;Change. It feels like we are onto something.

It\u2019s not an area that many psychotherapists decide to explore in their daily practice, but ever since I can remember it was the most appealing area of psychotherapy for me. And one that is highly unexplored and somehow underrepresented. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>One of the reasons why I decided to try Trauma Tour is my exchange with a patient over Twitter. We\u2019ve been talking online for a very long time about her experience, as she cannot come and see me in Belgium. And then I thought, I should be able to go and see her. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>We, psychotherapists, stay in our daily practices. We don\u2019t move. We don\u2019t reach out and explain things to people. We do things with individuals - why not try to work with a group, and talk to a group? This is what I\u2019d rather do. The more I thought about it, the more sense it made. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>Eventually I bought a bus. My very first tour this week goes to Ghent, where I already have connected with potential participants. It will be a chance for me to see in what ways I can connect with groups. How to talk to people about trauma? How to equip them with knowledge and capacity to deal with their own experiences? And what could \xa0be a possible model for sustaining the project, as I really want to go far with my tour, reaching the Balkans, Greece, visit communities out there. Ultimately, I\u2019d also like to volunteer in refugee camps and serve with my knowledge and experience there (I do work in an asylum center in Belgium once a week). </span></p>\n\n<p><span>During the preparation for the tour I have realised there is a big interest in the topic already - people really want to know more about trauma. I\u2019ve already taken a step towards promoting awareness and dealing with the problem - I wrote a book about trauma last year. The book became quite popular, and it\u2019s now being translated from Dutch to English. It will be available in January, and it is based on common licence, along with the exercises included. This decision is based on my view that psychological knowledge, and therapeutical knowledge, are all based on dozens of years of collective practice and wisdom accumulated which should be available to everyone without limitations, certifications, individualisation...</span></p>\n\n<p><span>I need to extend my network now in order to connect with communities and groups that would like to host me. I could be travelling from one place to another this way, knowing there would be support and people to talk to. I need to figure out best ways to sustain myself - travelling for long would cost me my patients, and a source of income. If you\u2019d like to give me a tip, share an idea, help me prepare the tour - leave a comment. </span></p>', u'post_id': 740, u'user_id': 3403, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-12 14:06:06', u'title': u'Trauma Tour'}, {u'content': u'<p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t assume a person with a disability is easily offended.\u201d</i></p>\n\n<p><i>\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \u2014\u201cDisability Etiquette\u201d from Wikipedia.\xa0</i></p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the research, we asked ourselves, \u201cWhat is disability?\u201dAccording to <i>Cerebral Palsy: A Guide for Care </i>by Bachrach Miller, the terms regarding disability are defined as such:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cImpairment is the correct term to use to define a deviation from normal, such as not being able to make a muscle move\u2026Disability is the term used to define a restriction in the ability to perform a normal activity of daily living which someone of the same age is able to perform. \u2026 Handicap is the term used to describe a child or adult who, because of the disability, is unable to achieve the normal role in society commensurate with his age and socio-cultural milieu\u2026All disabled people are impaired, and all handicapped people are disabled, but a person can be impaired and not necessarily be disabled, and a person can be disabled without being handicapped.\u201d[1]</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, more and more people begin to pay attention to how to address people with disabilities. The use of \u201cpeople-first language\u201d* in English aims to \u201cavoid the subconscious dehumanization when discussing people with disabilities\u201d[2]. However, as the researches continue and after we interviewed a few people with disabilities, we soon realized that language is not really a problem. Every person we interviewed all said that the word \u201cdisability\u201d doesn\u2019t bother them at all and they don\u2019t mind being called \u201cdisabled\u201d because it is a fact. (<span>Interview with Raul Krauthausen</span> by <a class="mention" href="/u/moriel">@Moriel</a>).</p>\n\n<p>So here is the question, if the language / term / vocabulary doesn\'t matter as much as we think, where does the problem really lies?</p>\n\n<p>Another example would be: why is it okay to say someone has dark hair but not okay to say someone is a gay or someone is a black especially in the western countries? It is because people who used these terms earlier in the history had a strong prejudice and discrimination in mind. In the end, language was created to describe things as how they are.

Costs are lower because multiple patients can be treated at the same time, in the same space (in the US, reclining garden chairs are commonly used to keep equipment costs even lower, as in the picture above). This is possible because this style of acupuncture mostly uses distal points on the arms and legs (no undressing required) and, after insertion and manipulation, the needles are left in to continue working for 20 minutes while the next patient is seen.</p>\n\n<p>[And if you are unfamiliar (or dubious) about what traditional acupuncture can treat, <a>here </a>are some research summaries from the British Acupuncture Council.]</p>\n\n<p>This area of the UK has a lot of rural poverty. The town in question used to be a centre of the textiles industry and still has associated businesses, but now is mostly well-known for being poor, backward and depressed in comparison to nearby Exeter or Taunton. A walk down the high street reals the unholy trifecta of economic malaise, high levels of obesity, ill-health and disability, and that indefinable loss of spirit in a town that convinces every young person of passion or ambition to leave the area at the earliest opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>The main message is that Community Multibed Acupuncture can be an incredibly powerful intervention in an area like this. The effect seems to come from a combination of:</p>\n\n<p>1) Effective health care - I\'ve lost count of the number of patients who have come in with stories of months or years of expensive National Health Service treatments that made no difference to their conditions, who then see a large reduction in their symptoms after only one or two acupuncture treatments. (Moves to provide acupuncture on the NHS over the last decades have been faltering and half-hearted, and are now suffering from a pushback against anything considered \'alternative\' or \'optional\' - which is a shame, as it could save the NHS millions).</p>\n\n<p>2) Humane treatment - unlike the increasingly isolating and interventionist treatments common in industrial healthcare, the effectiveness of traditional acupuncture shows patients that good health can often be achieved through minimal intervention, through working with the body rather than against it, through self-help, and lifestyle and dietary changes. Demonstrating that a more humane approach to health is possible starts people thinking about what else they need to question.</p>\n\n<p>3) Collective treatment - something about the nature of receiving shared treatment with other people seems to have an effect on people. Perhaps it cuts through the common Western idea of illness as something private, secret and shameful - whatever it is, sharing one\'s vulnerability and the act of seeking support and help with other community members seems to have a profound psychological charge.</p>\n\n<p>4) Affordability - although health care is free (\'at the point of use\') in the UK, it is, in effect, rationed; waiting lists are getting longer again, and many NHS trusts are effectively bankrupt. C&amp;MACs offer a form of healthcare without the expensive pharmaceuticals, electronics and salaried consultants. Most either offer a reduced rate (e.g. \xa320) or a sliding scale (e.g. \xa310-30, where you pay what you want). [I\'ve found problems with both models - resistance to the idea of a sliding scale is very common, and often leads users to undervalue what is being offered. Given that it has taken the District Council 2 months (at this time of counting) to respond to what should be a simple request for licensing, and given that the licence terms for this district are insanely onerous, I have found a degree of freedom and enjoyment in simply offering treatments for free and explaining to patients what sort of average donation is necessary to keep the clinic open.] If all kinds of healthcare were funded equally, acupuncture would prove massively more cost-effective than many \'mainstream\' modalities - not to mention less energy-intensive and ecologically-damaging.</p>\n\n<p>5) Knock-on effects - people who come to the clinic see flyers and posters for other events while they are there. They buy a coffee in the cafe upstairs and bump into other people they know. They go into other shops seeing as they are in town already. People who had given up on the town are excited that something like this would happen there. Maybe some people even wonder whether there is something they could do to get things happening in the local area. These are effects that are common to any community venture, many of which other ERs have mentioned elsewhere. As with education, art, reskilling, etc, the fact that users of the service are making positive changes in their lives, and are already feeling the benefit of being involved, seems to snowball this effect even more strongly.</p>', u'post_id': 671, u'user_id': 393, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-25 15:12:08', u'title': u'Community Acupuncture - an ongoing mutation'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 506, u'user_id': 3249, u'timestamp': u'2016-05-31 11:02:50', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p>The United Nations think that health care is the nub to development, and the forerunner to any of the other Sustainable Development Goals; that is for a country, or a continent...or Africa to develop strongly, there must be sound healthcare system first. I think that there are many suffering in Africa because of the unaffordable, inaccessible, and inadequate health care system, and I think that in order to keep the tolls of death low, perhaps people don\u2019t need to wait for a revolution to the health sector, maybe what we need is an easily accessible, and affordable health alternative. Because of the many polluted rivers, African children die daily from diarrhea. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention tells us that 2,195 children die EACH DAY from diarrhea. Due to the unaffordable health care system, many diabetic sufferers die without receiving proper medication or medical attention. Hence, many African countries like my country, Nigeria, have one of the highest diabetic sufferers and deaths.</p>\n\n<p>My name is Ivan Ezeigbo. I am 20 years old, and currently a sophomore at Minerva Schools at KGI, California, USA. I was inspired by Monica Marcu\u2019s book, The Miracle Tree, to research with a team back in Nigeria on the blood regulatory power of the contents of the leaves of a very medicinal plant. It is a herbal plant that has just drawn a lot of attention in its potential to cure over three hundred ailments. This is the Moringa Oleifera. We experimented on Wistar albino rats. The idea was to inject alloxan intraperitoneally to all groups of Wistar albino rats with healthy working pancreas (alloxan increases blood sugar level, thus inducing hyperglycaemia or making them \u201cpseudo-diabetic\u201d). The bioactive agents of moringa leaves were extracted with ethanol and water, and two groups of the rats were treated each with these contents. An additional group was treated with synthetic insulin (insulin is a natural blood regulatory hormone that brings down blood sugar level), and all three groups were observed. We discovered that the group of Wistar albino rats treated with the bioactive agents of the moringa leaves extracted with water had a SIGNIFICANTLY SIMILAR blood sugar level as those treated with synthetic insulin, and less significant with those treated with ethanol. This unearthened two truths. First, moringa has powerful blood regulatory effects, almost equivalent to the natural insulin. Secondly, water is a better extraction agent than ethanol, unlike the case for many other plant leaves. Aside its blood regulatory power, moringa also cures diarrhea, and many other bacterial and fungal infections. It is also a healthy store for numerous nutrients, vitamins and amino acids. It also thrives very well in these tropical regions of Africa, especially the Southern Nigeria. Armed with this knowledge, I took up the entrepreneurial project of making moringa teas using tea bags because this would not only help a lot of poor people in Nigeria, and Africa in general, who cannot afford or obtain quality health care, but would be a cheap and accessible way of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, since water is a good extraction agent for moringa, moringa teas would provide consumers the maximal health benefits. Even though, I have not had the necessary funding and have been self-funding this project, my motivation to help people live longer and healthier has kept this dream going, and I have not tired out in bringing this to fruition. I am still conducting researches and experiments on my tea, and I have just purchased about two plots of land for moringa farming. I would still need to set up an industry where these teas will be processed.</p>\n\n<p>This is good news to diabetic sufferers in Africa; it is good news to poor children and families in Africa who cannot afford quality health care. This is good news to hypertensive patients and the obese. This is good news to Africa. My dream is that this project greatly lowers mortality rate in Africa, and if we are not being too optimistic, perhaps...just perhaps, we may begin to realize stronger development.</p>\n\n<p>A link to the paper we published on the experiment with Wistar albino rats: <a href="http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.diabetes.20160503.02.html" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.diabetes.20160503.02.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.diabetes.20160503.02.html</a></p>', u'post_id': 725, u'user_id': 3382, u'timestamp': u'2016-08-25 12:12:58', u'title': u'The Answer to Africa?'}, {u'content': u'<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thesucreblue" rel="nofollow noopener">Sucre Blue</a> is a program that strives to create a chronic disease health care model to bring affordable access to medical treatment to people with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease in Bangalore. It\u2019s a challenging setting to work in. One has to think that in these communities there is no doctors, hospitals or medical treatment in place. Access to treatment is \xa0extremely limited (for diabetics as well - many forms are absent, some not always available, most of them too expensive anyway) and families earn 2 dollars per day. Many patients\u2019 diabetes is caused by malnutrition, despite the common conception that it is a rich people\u2019s condition. I often see blind children who lost their sight because their families lacked access to medication or means to purchase them. And all that in India, with the second fastest growth of diabetes in the world, and 70 percent of the population living in rural areas. Which makes it extremely difficult to identify those in need and ensure they\u2019re given help.</p>\n\n<p>For the past years, I have lived in India - partly in a hospital, without being paid, and I had a chance to see how the system works. As a diabetic myself, I\u2019ve experienced the hardships of managing my own illness and needed to adapt to available solutions.</p>\n\n<p>As an answer to this challenge, we are building a sustainable, and affordable model that could be replicated in other communities, across India and beyond. The service is based on dozens of patients and caregivers, who are being trained to provide other members of the community with door-to-door assistance. Our Community Health Workers in the pilot area conduct free screenings (sugar level, BMI, pressure monitoring) and check for diabetes and other health problems \xa0- which they can later address according to the needs of each of the patients. An important component of this work is building relationships between the patients and the leaders - and help to establish links between those in needs and institutions that could provide them with further help. We also provide patients with free medicine. On top of that, we educate, bring awareness and help with early detection of potential issues. Many pre-diabetics in India could avoid becoming ill by changes in their dietary habits - and the diet is large to blame here.</p>\n\n<p>Such screenings would not only help to support those who suffer from diabetes but extend preventive care and potentially save millions of dollars in treating more complex effects of diabetes, such as dialysis and other complications. Beyond that, we\u2019re helping some of the diabetics to overcome their poverty, as managing their problems costs \xbc of their income, pushing them to extreme poverty. Providing free treatment and medication is essential for them to improve their quality of life.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, we equip our workers with SMS technology that allows them to collect the daily logs and patient\'s\u2019 history - which will be stored in an open source database available to any researcher in the world. Otherwise, such information about chronically sick citizens of rural India is basically impossible to acquire.</p>\n\n<p>We plan to transform <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thesucreblue" rel="nofollow noopener">Sucre Blue</a> into a model that could be replicated by communities all over the world - with a peer-based approach, designed to deal with chronic diseases. In India, we engage women in our work - mostly those who suffer from diabetes themselves. It is a way to change a bit disproportionate representation of men in healthcare - and it empowers women in the society. \xa0Having their personal approach to diabetes allows us to change the opinion around the disease, often perceived as a curse, for example forbidding some of the ill to get married.</p>', u'post_id': 755, u'user_id': 3427, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-20 05:47:59', u'title': u'Sucre Blue'}, {u'content': u'<p>There is a growing recognition about the negative effects stemming from commodifying innovation through restrictive I.P. protection and exclusivity, especially in the medical field. Open Source Development methodologies in software emerged as the dominant form of collaborative innovation in the late 90\u2019s and the trend has been spreading to a wider sphere of work. The IT infrastructure of today\u2019s world enables peers to connect, share and collaborate on solving common issues through use of collective knowledge. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production" rel="nofollow noopener">Commons-based peer production</a> is the term that defines such collaborative efforts by peers. The collaborators act as the stewards of commonly held wealth and assets which could be anything ; monies, knowledge, equipment, reputations, social capital etc.The beauty of such networks is that development for one project can be mixed and remixed to suit a variety of other needs. Traditionally, such endeavors have been part of a gift-economy where peers do not seek tangible rewards for their contributions. However, for larger scale and mainstream economic model, gift economy is not a viable method for development. The question, then, is how do we keep track of contributions to inform fair rewards?</p>\n\n<p>That is where the <a href="http://valuenetwork.referata.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow noopener">Open Value Network</a> model (OVN) comes in. An OVN is built around a core open source community, preserving its nature, and adds layers of governance, infrastructure and methodologies in order to make large scale, open innovation networks as predictable and accountable as traditional organizations, such as coops or limited liability corporations. In an OVN, contributions to a process, be it tangible items such as time and money or intangibles such as social capital, are recorded and whatever benefit is derived from this process is proportionally divided and distributed back to contributors. This makes open networks sustainable, by allowing the implementation of capturing and redistribution mechanisms. Networks have yet to gain public recognition, legitimacy and legality, but the jury is out already, the OVN model makes open networks fully capable socioeconomic agents.</p>\n\n<p>SENSORICA is the first instantiation of the OVN model. It originated in Montreal, in early 2011. The initial focus of the network was to develop open source scientific research equipment using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production" rel="nofollow noopener">commons-based peer production</a> methodologies. Indeed, most of activities are coordinated from the SENSORICA Montreal lab, a physical location where local affiliates can meet and work together. However, the Network Resource Planning (NRP) tools that Sensoricans have developed lays the foundation of a strong decentralized community without geographical borders. It allows tracking of the flow of resources through the entire system, at both micro and macro levels. NRP is the mainstay of all SENSORICA projects, and enables SENSORICA to practically implement the ideologies of collaborative and open innovation in a transparent and equitable manner.</p>\n\n<p>The video bellow explains the idea in detail.</p>\n\n<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="Ixgp8_B9g5A" data-youtube-title="Open value networks: Tiberus Brastaviceanu at TEDxMontreal" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>\n\n<p>The wellness of societies and communities also depend on the innovation of its peers. Over the past few decades, the care aspect of communities has also been commodified. Healthcare and Education, the basics of human needs, have slowly been removed from the sphere of communities and instead, been handed over to closed and elitist institutions, including companies for profit-maximization. The result is a disjointed system where even these basic necessities are the purvey of the well-off. Moreover, in health care the quest for new cures and treatments is a quest for profits, and resources are mainly deployed in research and development (R&amp;D) that promises good returns on investments. The illnesses of a few are forgotten. Just like with technological innovation, we, as a society, need to free knowledge and break down barriers to participation. For that to happen, Open Science will play a big part, meeting the requirement of creating open source scientific equipment and research methodologies that enable peers to do R&amp;D on issues most important to them.</p>\n\n<p>SENSORICA\'s position on Open Science</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="http://www.sensorica.co/home/working-space/activity-clusters/open-science" rel="nofollow noopener">See more on Open Science on SENSORICA\'s website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Guy Rouleau, the director of <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/neuro-brain-research-patient-care-and-training" rel="nofollow noopener">McGill University\u2019s Montreal Neurological Institute</a> (MNI) announced recently <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/montreal-institute-going-open-accel-erate-science" rel="nofollow noopener">in the Science Magazine</a> that his institute was going to steer towards Open Science.</p>\n\n<blockquote><i>\u201cWe think that it is a way to accelerate discovery and the application of neuroscience.\u201d (\u2026) \u201cThere is a fair amount of patenting by people at the institute, but the outcomes have not been very useful\u201d (...) \u201cIt comes down to what is the reason for our existence?

But this project is very different. As we are designing the hardware device, we are also thinking about how the data generated from its use during therapy sessions will be managed. It turns out that the blockchain technology can truly revolutionize how therapy and medical care are administered, and how the medical data is managed, and SENSORICA has already embarked in blockchain applications development.</p>\n\n<blockquote><span>--&gt; blockchain and other p2p technologies create the possibility of new health care services</span></blockquote>\n\n<p>The vision for SENSORICA is to demonstrate the economic viability and practical superiority of open innovation. Since innovation has been segregated from community for the better part of the last century, the possibilities of applications are endless. We are not claiming to have the solution all the problems that our health care system is facing, but our past experiences have allowed us to peer into a new realm of solutions, enabled by the new digital technology and the new socioeconomic processes it has made possible.</p>\n\n<p>There is a lot of criticism for commons-based peer processes pertaining to their ability to deliver large scale solutions, while being self-sustainable. In other words, the conclusions point to the persistent need of traditional forms of organizing innovation, production and distribution, in order to fuel these new processes: <i>one needs to have a paid job to contribute to open source development</i>. The flaw in these arguments is that they analyse these new practices within the traditional capitalist paradigm. Commons-based peer processes are part of a new socioeconomic paradigm, which prescribes its own underlying theory of value and its own capturing and redistribution mechanisms. Saying that open innovation is unsustainable is factually false, even within the capitalist regime. <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/" rel="nofollow noopener">Arduino</a>, for example, is a very successful commercial operation relying entirely on open source hardware and software technology. Most successful 3D printing and personal drone commercial operations also rely on open source, as well as operations that provide blockchain applications. All these new and disruptive technologies are dominated by these new types of ventures who know how to steward open networks. Something is going on here, for those who have eyes to see. And all these organizations are only hybrids, in the sense that their structure have capturing mechanisms that function in a market-driven economy, while relying on commons-based peer processes for innovation. SENSORICA has data that shows, perhaps for the first time, how capturing mechanisms that are fully compatible with the logic of the p2p economy can be gradually introduced within this transitory economy, to become dominant in a very near future.</p>\n\n<p>We do not have experience in pharmaceuticals. We cannot prescribe today a method through commons-based peer production to deliver a new drug, going through all the norms and regulations. The monetary costs associated with this type of ventures are huge, and if we transpose the challenge in an OVN setting it would require the deployment of an amount of resources and a complexity that we cannot sustain, at this point in time. But we do not see a hard barrier... As these systems scale, one day they will be capable of undertaking such challenges. Alternatively, we do have extensive experience with scientific instruments and less costly, and less regulated therapeutic devices. This is the path of least resistance for OVNs to infiltrate the care domain and gain strength. Joshua Pearce\'s conclusions show that once open source-based scientific instruments enter a market niche it totally disrupts it, putting traditional companies out of business, as they cannot sustain their operations at such low product prices. Operating at lower prices, the monetary rewards an organization gets for the product, doesn\'t mean that we are going towards poverty. The zero marginal cost tendency, driven by open innovation, only makes sense in the capitalist paradigm.

In our fluid, hyper-individualized societies, families, village communities and urban neighborhoods are weakening (if not totally disappearing). Individuals, given their life structure, have less and less practical possibilities to take care of others (even when, in principle, they would do it).\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Care institutions, which were supposed to substitute the traditional community\u2019s and individual\u2019s care, have fewer and fewer economic resources (and often political will) to do it.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>The gap between the growing demand and the shrinking offer of care is the basis of the present care crisis</strong>: a lack of care that is <strong>practical</strong> (the caring system do not succeed in coping with the care demand) as well as <strong>psychological</strong> (the sense of loneliness deriving from the lack of sense of care throughout the whole society).\xa0</p>\n\n<p>To overcome this crisis brand new care systems have to be imagined and enhanced.\xa0A first step is to better understand caring activities, considering their nature and diversity.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The practical/organizational side of care is particularly important because care is more than exchange of information and knowledge. Care requires proximity and action: doing something for each other, taking time and being committed.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Care activities. </strong></em>Care activities are quite diverse: they can be performed by whoever could be willing to do it (as shopping for groceries for somebody who is temporarily sick); they can require a lot of time, attention, and assumption of responsibility (as taking care of the daily life necessities of somebody seriously ill); they can require timely actions by highly specialized experts (as performing\xa0surgery in very specific moments). And so on. \xa0\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In general terms, these differences are characterized by a set of main parameters:\xa0</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<b><em>Time</em>: duration, frequency, flexibility, \u2026</b><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<b><em>Space</em>: virtual, hybrid, only physical, \u2026</b><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<b><em>Competences</em>: normal everyday life socialization, specific diffuse knowledge, specialized expert knowledge, \u2026</b><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<b><em>Responsibility</em>: very low; low, high, very high.</b><br>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Different care actions should be attentively analyzed and mapped using these parameters. Intuitively, we can already say that different care activities could be delivered by different actors in different modalities.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><em>To imagine a new care system, we </em><em>should</em><em>\xa0recognize all the potential </em><em>caregivers</em><em> and consider them as resources. Either as effective care resources (when they are already active). Or as potential care resources (when they can be\xa0activated under certain conditions)</em></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Care resources</em>.</strong> In principle, everybody can care for someone else. He or\xa0she can do it in different forms (depending on his/her expertise and time availability), but all of them require attention. In turn, given that attention is a limited resource (each person has a limit in his/hers capability to give attention), this is true also for his/her capability to care. Care (both the expert and non-expert one) is a diffuse but limited resource.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Presently, care systems are built on a mix of three main resources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<b>Institutional care givers (based on professional actors)</b><br>\n</li>\n\n</ul><ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<b>Third sector and charity organizations (based on both professional and nonprofessional actors)</b><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<b>Traditional care communities (as families, village communities, urban neighborhoods ).</b><br>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>We know that, for different reasons, all of them are in difficulty to cope with the growing care demand. Therefore, the issue is to reshape the system in order to permit to new potential resources to </em><em>emerge</em><em> and become effective resources.\xa0</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Mainstream and countertrends.</strong></em> We have said that, in principle, everybody, depending on his/her time and expertise, could give some forms of care. But we can observe that today, in the contemporary societies, this care potential, clashes with the dominant culture and practice.\xa0In the name of individual freedom and convenience, our culture\xa0tends to assume a careless approach to everything and everyone (the throwaway society extended from things to human relationships). And: a mainstream practice of living that makes it difficult to introduce care activities in the daily life (due to work constraints, to the evolution of families and to their being scattered in different places).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, given the present structures of family and work, few people can commit to offering care, especially if this requires continuity, high responsibility and duration in time.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, several examples tell us that there still are several people who could and would dedicate some time/energy/attention to well-defined caring activities - if and when an appropriate enabling system would permit them to do it in an easy and flexible way.</p>\n\n<p>This limited but diffuse caring availability is the potential resource that the socio-technical innovation should be capable to transform in an effective resource. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>In other words, thanks to an appropriate socio-technical innovation, it should become possible to cultivate and harvest the limited individual caring resources of broader groups of subjects. That is, to catalyze and coordinate existing but not used care resources could be the key to overcoming the crisis of care in contemporary societies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hypothesis and vision</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Hypothesis.</em></strong> If the close (social or institutional) organizations of the past cannot cope with the dimension and complexity of the present demand of care, they must be opened. That is: the care activities must be divided in smaller/lighter tasks, and allocated to a large number of actors, each one giving what he/she is capable/willing to give.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Vision.</em></strong> Open care is an ecosystem of care-related interactions, characterized by being distributed among a large number of individuals, groups and institutions, with different competence, responsibility and commitment: \xa0from the highly specialized actors and institutions\xa0to family members, friends and neighbours with no specific knowledge and limited time availability.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Viability</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Social preconditions and enabling systems. </em></strong>To be viable, open care requires two main social preconditions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<b>The existence of a large number of other actors (relatives, friends, neighbors) willing to care for someone, even though they have practical limits (in terms of time and resource availability).</b><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<b>The existence of dedicated and specialized actors capable of intervening when their competencies are (really) needed.</b><br>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Given the previous social preconditions, the open care potentialities are made real thanks to the existence of a technological and organizational system capable of catalyzing \xa0diffuse resources, coordinate them and give their action the needed continuity. More precisely, this enabling system should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<em><b>match different demands with different offers (in terms of competence)</b></em><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<em><b>give different care actions coherence and continuity (from the point of view of the care receiver)</b></em><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<em><b>promote and support both relational and the highly effective ones (i.e. the most specialized, professional interventions).</b></em><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<em><b>be organically part of </b></em><b><em>a larger systems</em></b><em><b>: the ecosystem of interactions that represents what today we can refer to as a local community. </b></em>\u200b\u200b</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Social innovation and open care</strong></p>\n\n<p>The open care viability is based on the existence of a whole stream of social (and socio-technical) innovation that is already moving in a similar direction.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In fact, in the complexity of contemporary society we can find several promising cases (some of them are still social prototypes, some others have already reached a more mature stage). For instance:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<b><em>Circles of care</em></b>:<b> </b>groups of citizen facing the same problem (as: diabetes, allergies, obesity, \u2026 or simply the old age) who mutually support each other, with the supervision of a team of doctors and nurses (a well-known example is the Circle in UK: <a href="http://www.participle.net/ageing" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://www.participle.net/ageing" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.participle.net/ageing</a> ).</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<b><em>Networks of care</em></b><em>:</em><b> </b>coordinated networks of family members, friends and neighbors, who share and coordinate their efforts to care for a person with serious problems (a well-known example is Tyze in Canada <a href="http://tyze.com" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://tyze.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://tyze.com</a> )</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<em><b>Intergenerational cooperation</b></em>: organizations that supports the encounter of young and elderly people mainly around the theme of collaborative living (a well-known example is Prendi a casa uno studente (Take a student at home), in Italy: <a href="http://www.meglio.milano.it/pratiche_studenti.htm" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://www.meglio.milano.it/pratiche_studenti.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.meglio.milano.it/pratiche_studenti.htm</a> )</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<em><b>Collaborative inclusion</b></em><b>: </b>organizations of migrants and residents collaborating to produce both migrant\u2019s inclusion and social values, for both the migrants and the whole community (an example is: \xa0Dine with us, in Belgium: <a href="http://dinewithus.strikingly.com" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://dinewithus.strikingly.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://dinewithus.strikingly.com</a> ) \xa0\xa0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Considering these\xa0diverse examples, we can observe that they present three common characteristics: (1) some care activities are delivered by non-professional actors; (2) the overall care burden is shared between different subjects; (3) specialized interventions are asked only when they are really needed. \xa0</p>\n\n<p><em>These examples are interesting because they give us an idea on how open care components could work. Nevertheless, in my view, they are not yet the full representation of the open care vision. </em></p>\n\n<p><em>To better approximate it, two steps should be taken:</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<b>To rethink each one of these service ideas adopting the radically open approach that characterizes the Open Care research.</b><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<b>To consider the whole socio-technical ecosystem, and to improve it in order to give all of them and a multiplicity of similar ones the possibility to flourish</b><br>\n</li>\n\n</ul>', u'post_id': 497, u'user_id': 3045, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-15 09:36:52', u'title': u'Collaborative care.

We organize practical workshops for children from all backgrounds to get them in touch with biology in a fun way. We do this because the role of biological technologies will become increasingly bigger as we move towards a circular society. Education plays a fundamental role in allowing people to be a part of this process.</p>\n\n<p>Why are we doing this? My personal motivation is best shown through\xa0a memory from my biotechnological engineering studies. We went on a company visit to Monsanto. At the time, I was not particularly aware of the dirty business they were in. We got to see the production facility, water treatment installations and large glyphosate tanks, which are all used to produce Roundup. During the luxurious lunch, which Monsanto employees also attended, a fellow student whispered to me: \u201chow can they sleep at night, considering they work for such a questionable company?\u201d. That was the only thing that I heard about the issue from anyone at school, both teachers or students. I didn\u2019t (now to my shame) know anything about Monsanto at the time and had to look it up myself afterwards. I was baffled and disgusted. What are we teaching our students?</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the perspective we teach, relevance is important as well. I hated biology in high school. If you had told me I\u2019d be a bioengineer someday, I would have laughed in disbelief. The content of biology class often remains descriptive (you\xa0learn about the parts of a plant cell), while higher education and jobs are all about application (you use these plant cells to grow something useful, like a building). A child that likes\xa0engineering, design and coding should consider\xa0studying biology. This is fundamental if we want enough people to develop sustainable technologies for the future.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/290db74661f062dfcecf295700a1a5ff75b2183b" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/2/290db74661f062dfcecf295700a1a5ff75b2183b.jpg" class="lightbox" title="IMG_20160831_204348_0.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/290db74661f062dfcecf295700a1a5ff75b2183b_1_666x500.jpg" width="666" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">IMG_20160831_204348_0.jpg</span><span class="informations">2500x1875 357 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>ReaGent has been going for about a year. We\u2019ve experimented with several ways to bring biology closer to society. We\'ve had children work with enzymes, build\xa0their own microscope, extract DNA and much more.\xa0The coming year, we will expand to reach more children and this scale-up entails several challenges.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cell division</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a first step, we have decided to continue the project under a new name: <strong>Ecoli</strong>. The DIY biolab in Ghent will stay as ReaGent, while Ecoli will provide biology education to children and underprivileged groups. A DIYbio space or biohackerspace and child education are not very compatible regarding administrative or legal aspects, like insurance and licenses. Another reason for the split is the different story we want to tell.</p>\n\n<p>The story to inspire a citizen scientist or biohacker is different from the story to inspire a child. Moreover, DIYbio has had issues with public perception. We find it important that knowledge is spread equally and that everyone can participate in an open discussion. We would not like a distorted image to shape decisions and opinions of people, leading them to self-censor and potentially miss out on learning opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>The creativity, mindset and <a href="https://diybio.org/codes/draft-diybio-code-of-ethics-from-european-congress/">ethics</a>\xa0present in a DIYbio lab strengthen and form the way we educate. We feel like we get the benefits without the drawbacks if the DIY biolab and educational project are two separate entities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Funding education in a fair way</strong></p>\n\n<p>The question that I posed in the initial post\xa0was on how to fund education outside of, but as an addition to, the traditional state-funded system.</p>\n\n<p>Making a project like this financially sustainable is a challenge. The groups where we have our biggest impact, and thus create the most value, are also least capable of paying for it. We have set up a way to partially fund this by doing workshops in the classical school circuit. Our impact there is equally important and they can afford to pay (a little) for our services. It remains to be seen if we can sustain ourselves in the long term.</p>\n\n<p>Chances are, we\xa0will\xa0have to find funds elsewhere \u2013government or industry. Government is the obvious choice, since education falls under their responsibility. Though, as often with government, it would be na\xefve to count on funding. Additionally, it entails somewhat of an administrative burden (especially in Belgium and the EU) and it\u2019s a slow process.</p>\n\n<p>So, do we want to cooperate with big biotech companies? How will this affect what we want to achieve with Ecoli? Do we risk that public opinion, or opinions of parents, ultimately influences\xa0what a child learns? Biotech has plenty of shortcomings \u2013<a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/9/22/9366721/daraprim-price-shkreli-turing">funding and market mechanisms</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/chinese-scientists-genetically-modify-human-embryos-1.17378">ethical</a>,\xa0<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_kahn_gene_editing_can_now_change_an_entire_species_forever?language=en">ecological</a>\xa0and the list goes on. But it\u2019s a technology, a tool that can be used for good and bad. The drawbacks that I mentioned are effects of the way it is used and not inherent to the technology. If we are scared of biotech, it is because we are scared of ourselves, and rightfully so.</p>\n\n<p>We still have the option of telling a nuanced story. Especially if we can highlight these issues during education, which is a rarity. My personal Monsanto experience is only one example.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Caring with science</strong></p>\n\n<p>More fundamentally, care is everyone\u2019s responsibility in one way or another. Earlier this week, one of our team members went to visit an institute that accompanies people with a mental disability. He visited them to explain what we do and to offer them biology workshops for their audience, the responsible\u2019s jaw dropped as she launched off in enthusiasm, pointing out all the ways we could cooperate. She said nobody ever thought of deeming their people worthy of science oriented workshops. Even if it\u2019s just for entertainment, science or technology can be used for care. People have a tendency to underestimate capabilities of certain groups, like little kids or special needs people. On the other hand, there\u2019s a tendency to overestimate the intelligence required to grasp or play with basic principles. The power lies in how it\u2019s communicated.</p>\n\n<p>This is only one of plenty of groups that don\u2019t get equal chances for quality education. It is part of the mission of Ecoli to provide those groups the opportunity to learn and discover.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Beyond the tools</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are likely at the start of a similar revolution like the digital revolution. That means we have the chance to try and anticipate this time round; to try and prepare people; to embed values, like openness and inclusiveness, that make sure we don\u2019t need to fix the problems of accessibility and literacy afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>What we do can be considered an experiment and in many ways, it\u2019s not necessarily about biology. We hope that, in addition to growing a basic biological literacy, we help to build\xa0a shift in attitude. When we watch global developments, it is clear that the biggest problems we face don\u2019t require technological solutions. Even problems that are directly caused by a misuse of technology, like climate change, could be headed towards a solution by changing our attitude, especially when combined with more sustainable bio-based technologies. A change in behaviour is not likely to happen overnight, but if we can build institutions that promote caring, collaboration and trust, we might be on our way.</p>\n\n<p>We are engaging with the Edgeryders community because we hope our actions can be part of a bigger solution. One where different actors work on improving their respective fields. By sharing experiences of our project with the Edgeryders community we hope we can grow more resilience for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>We will be attending the workshop in Brussels on the 24<sup>th</sup> of September and would be delighted to meet you!</p>\n\n<p>If you connect to our story, let us know! We love feedback and discussing the subject. Here\u2019s some other questions that occupy our mind. Should this type of initiative stay an addition to the state-funded system? Is this form of bottom-up activism, independent of the government or in spite of it, ultimately a desirable strategy?</p>\n\n<p><i>The production of this\xa0article was supported by\xa0<a href="/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296">Op3n\xa0Fellowships</a>\xa0-\xa0an ongoing program for community contributors\xa0during May - November 2016.</i></p>', u'post_id': 530, u'user_id': 3362, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-04 22:55:24', u'title': u'Bringing quality biology education to every child equally'}, {u'content': u'<h2>\n\n</h2><p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/21a0a001afc551f5b281223f22c766aa21a0b94e" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/2/21a0a001afc551f5b281223f22c766aa21a0b94e.png" class="lightbox" title="TweetUp.png"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/21a0a001afc551f5b281223f22c766aa21a0b94e_1_690x230.png" width="690" height="230"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">TweetUp.png</span><span class="informations">1500x500 101 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<h2>A short online event where you can quickly catch up on what is happening in the community, tweet support or ask any questions.

After graduation, I spent years working for French and international industrial companies, after which I quit and went on to work in the humanitarian field throughout Southeast Asia. With the arrival of new technologies and the community approach using the Internet to connect people, it became clear to me that there are now widespread and relatively cheap tools of empowerment readily available. Upon my return to Europe, I decided to work on the development of such ideas. This led to the inception of the <a href="http://echopen.org" rel="nofollow noopener">echOpen</a> project.</p>\n\n<p>The idea started from a chat among friends, an engineer (Luc) previously employed in the ultrasound industry, a mathematician and physician (Mehdi) and a radiologist (Pierre). We discussed smartphones: widespread devices that are more sophisticated than the computers that sent people to the moon a few decades ago.</p>\n\n<p>How could we use this technology to improve health care, considering that now almost everyone have one in his/her pocket?</p>\n\n<p>This idea emerged as a combination of our passion for open technology and community engagement. Using technologies that have existed since the 70s,with a bit of tweaking, are cheap and perfectly functional to make this idea come true. We then give access to these tools and knowledge to anyone interested, and to encourage them to try new things out.</p>\n\n<p>This is how our mission came about. We plan to develop the very first Open Source, affordable ultrasound probe (echo-stethoscope) dedicated to diagnosis orientation, based on open source hardware and software principles. It will be cheaper than any of the fancy machines you can find on the market. There already are some ultraportable ultrasound scanners out there, but they cost several thousand Euros \xa0our goal is to divide the price by 10-15 times. This device will be able to produce a medical image that you can then transport to your smartphone or laptop. It\u2019s a device that every health care professional will want to carry in their pocket - allowing for faster and more accurate diagnosis orientation, which means faster and better medical care. As a preventive tool, it will reduce the number of patients who need emergency help. It can save the lives of mothers who die in developing countries during their pregnancies. Our tool will also spark more interactions between professionals and patients.</p>\n\n<p>We launched the project in late 2014, but the actual work really began in August 2015. Hosted by the hospital Hotel Dieu, right next to the Notre Dame in Paris, we have an open space with an interesting, eclectic ecosystem of researchers, community members, senior professionals working in the technical and medical areas of ultrasound technology, radiologists, experts in echography, medical laboratories, universities, and schools, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, we developed a functional prototype of the tool - it works, but the quality of the image is not satisfactory. With the involvement of more than 200 people, mostly from France but also in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, we are now improving the quality of echOpen. Our deadline to complete the new medical-quality prototype is this December.</p>\n\n<p>Our project has been supported by the Fondation Pierre Fabre, which believes in our approach and that our concept could be used in Africa, where doctors lack medical imaging devices. They provide financial support and other resources - and the more we have, the faster and more efficiently we can do our work.</p>\n\n<p>We are constantly looking for both funding and new profiles to get involved within the community, anyone from developers, to designers, engineers, legal experts, and community managers. We are also working on making our wiki more accessible to English-speaking members.

Successi e difficolt\xe0 che tuttavia solo in questi ultimi anni hanno visto agire nei processi decisionali con un riconosciuto ruolo di protagonisti le persone direttamente interessate. Un cammino spessissimo difficoltoso, che richiede abnegazione oltre che motivazioni solide ed acquisite competenze sul campo, attuato da pochi in favore di molti spesso non consapevoli, iterando almeno per i secondi una sorta di continua delega in bianco in merito al proprio futuro.</p>\n\n<p>Un colpevolmente atteggiamento passivo, che caratterizza tutt\'ora l\'esistenza di chi bisognoso di particolari attenzioni, che la forza \u201cdestabilizzante\u201d del Progetto pu\xf2 mutare risvegliando le coscienze di quei molti che potrebbero e dovrebbero veramente mettersi in gioco.</p>\n\n<p>Il secondo elemento intimamente correlato al precedente riguarda il ruolo dell\'associazionismo \u201cdi categoria\u201d, del terzo settore in generale, che in questi anni \u2013 ma anche oggi ed auspicabilmente domani \u2013 hanno garantito alle fasce deboli della popolazione una vita dignitosa e rispettosa attraverso la creazione, il consolidamento ed il faticoso mantenimento di soluzioni e processi sociali ed assistenziali in sostituzione di un apparato pubblico sempre pi\xf9 in difficolt\xe0 e molto spesso privo di sensibilit\xe0 e visione rispettose dei bisogni individuali quanto povero di capacit\xe0 strategiche in relazione ai profondi cambiamenti dei quali sono oggetto il sociale e l\'amministrazione della cosa pubblica.

Our mission is to expand collective material and organizational capacities in order to build revolution in the 21st century. With a workshop, library, kitchen, and meeting space, we focus on efforts to self-organize, connect, create infrastructures, and develop greater individual and collective efficacy. \xa0The Woodbine Health Autonomy Resource Center is a communal space in the neighborhood of Ridgewood, Queens. \xa0It is part of the Autonomy General Assembly, which is a gathering space for the different projects that are housed within Woodbine. \xa0The idea behind Woodbine comes in the wake of Occupy, but takes its motivations from the Zapatistas in Chiapas, the ZADs in France, communities in Rojava, and all those who have struggled for liberation. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>As we begin answering questions of autonomy, we are faced with the myriad of material obstacles in our way. \xa0Health, or our lack thereof, can be seen as a crucial weakness in the revolutionary struggle. \xa0We are tied to a \u201cmodern\u201d health system that fundamentally removes our bodies from a larger physical reality. \xa0We are made to become cells in revolt, aberrant genes, failed organs, physicalities riddled with disease. \xa0Disease becomes individualized as \u201chealth\u201d and \u201cwellness\u201d becomes commodified. \xa0States of mental health become symbols of individualized weakness. Propensities toward depressed states, or anxious disorders, and \u201cimbalances\u201d in the brain necessitate chemical intervention, while never addressing the overwhelming emptiness of modern life. \xa0An insane mind is the mind that can adapt to an insane society, and from the news today, we are surely going insane. \xa0Insanity as the only rational response to an insane world, but what contemporary visions of \u201chealth\u201d require of us, in order to perpetuate this economy, is that we be atomized, necessarily taking on our struggles alone, seeing them as the individual product of a weak, chemically imbalanced mind. If we refuse this logic, begin to express the anger necessary for a health that recognizes the truly horrific nature of the time we\u2019re living in and develop shared practices of care that diffuse that isolation, we can begin to grow the collective backbone we so desperately need.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from a critique of modern theories on health, we as a community have lost all control over our health. \xa0Our individualized choices to workout, eat right, not smoke, etc are important, but wholly insufficient to answer the demands of this century. \xa0In order to access healthcare, we are tied to jobs that are literally killing us, whether it be mental depravity or physical degradation. \xa0Many people are in constant fear of losing this state granted access, but then are also in fear of having to access such a system, a system that is the cause of more than 50% of bankruptcies. \xa0Because we have relegated health to these institutions, we have lost our ability to heal ourselves. \xa0We no longer know the abundance of nature in helping to create health. \xa0Most people cannot perform basic first aid or use simple techniques for health. \xa0Many communities lack any cognizance or skill to handle the inevitable emotional collapse of our comrades. \xa0In addition, these institutions fundamentally cannot address the issues of climate change, economic collapse, or disruption of key infrastructure. \xa0They are as weak as we are, as evidenced by the effects of superstorms on the health infrastructure of New Orleans and New York. \xa0How can these institutions help us when the very air we breath is killing us? \xa0How do they help us adapt to a world without clean water? \xa0To answer the sadness in our souls to live in a world where we have killed all the fish in the ocean? \xa0</p>\n\n<p>To answer simply, they cannot. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>They are tied to the same system we are, replete with the same fundamental limitations. \xa0But we are not the same. While we are in chains, we are not of the system. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>We have not always lived this way. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>And to remember this fact is to regain our humanity. \xa0</p>\n\n<h2>Where we are now</h2>\n\n<p>Within Woodbine, the struggle for autonomy has been broken down into specific \u201ctracks\u201d, meant to focus our attention on tangible obstacles to building functioning communities. \xa0The health track is composed of a mix of health professionals and those with informal training in various health practices. \xa0We place an emphasis on re-creating a sense of community wellness and the dissemination of skills. \xa0We work to create ties with those who practice herbal medicines, massage, kinesiology, acupuncture, meditation, yoga and other forms of so called \u201calternative\u201d medicine. \xa0We work on owning our own definition of wellness, from the physical to the mental. \xa0In addition, we investigate current systems of western medicine, skills, and ultimately, work to develop an ability to manipulate these institutions to serve our goals. \xa0We do not reject modern methods of medicine, but rather recognize the need to detach the knowledge from the oppressive institutions that guard it. Food and the environment have a fundamental role in health, and because of this, will have their own tracks to address their wide breadth of knowledge. \xa0Overall, this track allows us to answer the questions of how do we begin the process of removing our physical and mental minds from an oppressive system, to reclaim our control over health and use health to increase our collective autonomy. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>Within the city, there is a public health infrastructure with clinics and hospitals. \xa0While there are significant problems associated with these institutions, they do provide much of the emergency and chronic care in the city. \xa0There are also spaces dedicated to holistic type medicine, although many of these are inaccessible to large portions of the population. \xa0For these reasons, we started by building a health resource center within our Woodbine space. \xa0The space is meant to be a means to involve community members, understand the care-related skills they have, and be an informational center. \xa0We have public open times for the community, staffed by one of our members. \xa0We also have begun offering a series of basic skills, including basic first aid, wound care,community health, food and nutrition, wellness, and many others. \xa0Our goal is that participants can use the informational aspect to understand their disease process, find resources of different modalities, and either receive aid in navigating the health systems in place or find treatment within the space itself. \xa0And finally, we have a preventative aspect, with our communal Sunday dinners, organic farm share, and weekly workout sessions, where we are beginning the process of owning our own health.</p>\n\n<h2>Where we are going</h2>\n\n<p>Our overarching goal is to examine what health autonomy would look like for us here in the city. \xa0We are beginning with the basics by providing ways to interact with neighbors, to think of health in a communal sense, and to aggregate the people and resources from which to begin our journey. \xa0Our short term goal is to continue with our introductory skill shares, create concrete ways to navigate the overwhelming health infrastructure that exists, and build a health community. \xa0We are also beginning to experiment with providing care outside of the realm of state control. \xa0This practice may involve working outside the structure of licenses, certifications and insurance. \xa0Our intention is always to heal, and so we must find ways to do so that protects providers and patients. \xa0As we progress, we will consider creating a larger clinical space, with more emphasis on offering a range of clinical modalities. \xa0Finally, as Woodbine looks to expand our sense of territory to upstate NY, we will look to an expansion of the project to include a more rural context, likely in the form of a functioning low-fee/no-pay clinic. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>As we move through the journey towards health autonomy, we find ourselves in a context that has removed us from our ability to understand our reality . \xa0We fight that disconnection and work to build the infrastructure that can allow us the space to envision a new existence. \xa0We look forward to hearing your stories, to understand your struggles and to collectively create the foundations to answer these monumental questions. \xa0</p>\n\n<h2>My questions for peers doing related work elsewhere\u2026</h2><ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tHow do you create sustainability? \xa0Donation based/grant based/fee based?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tHow do you interact with existing structures?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tHow do you work with or around licensures/certifications to provide safe care?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Contact us:</p>\n\n<p><a>Woodbine.nyc</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1792377994328928/">Woodbine Health Autonomy FB group</a></p>', u'post_id': 521, u'user_id': 3367, u'timestamp': u'2016-08-11 01:38:34', u'title': u'Woodbine Health Autonomy Center'}, {u'content': u'<p>I\'m Narindra Michel RAKOTOARISOA, I was born near of tropical forest in east of Madagascar, near by raining forest.

I didn\'t know too much people who suffer with the same illness like mine until now...</p>\n\n<p>More than the half of the forest in my country has been cutted for combustion, furnitures, slash and burn,...

To work towards this, FOCS\u2019 mission is to build a strong community by supporting families of color through parenting programs, resource sharing and fostering meaningful connections. For example, programs include regular parenting groups led by trained parent facilitators of color, multi-cultural art classes for kids and adults, and community events and resources on relevant topics for families of color. FOCS is unique in providing safe spaces where families of color can build community with a focus on race, identity, culture and ethnicity through a lens of social and racial justice. \xa0Since our founding in 2013, FOCS has evolved into an active base of over 1000 interethnic, intercultural families of color in South Seattle and the greater Seattle/King County area in Pacific Northwest of United States of America. .</p>\n\n<p>Born out of the desire for alternatives to mainstream parenting groups, FOCS tackles serious challenges head on. There is a lack of effective opportunities for community dialogues on race and family. Culturally-relevant and multiracial parenting resources are unknown or unwritten. Mainstream organizations aren\u2019t committed to anti-racist policies and practices for our children of color. And families of color seek a safe community where shared experiences and cultural understanding are the norm.</p>\n\n<p>Today, FOCS is a nonprofit organization led by women of color including the Executive Director and Founder Amy Pak as well as FOCS\u2019 7-member board of directors. Prior to incorporation, core volunteers dedicated hundreds of hours to evolve and solidify the needs of our community based on what we\u2019d be hearing from our families. We have grown from an all-volunteer start-up group to one that is led by .5 FTE staff, 2 interns, 1 Rainier Valley Corps Fellow, professional and diverse Board of directors and hundreds of dedicated family volunteers. It is critical to us that FOCS employs and utilizes the assets of our parents of color network for \u201cpeer to peer\u201d learning and sharing. This builds strong community and ensures our voices are lifted up and valued. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>Since 2013, 30 parent groups have been organized, providing weekly support and reduced social isolation for over 180 parenting group participants. FOCS ARTS cultural arts programming has engaged over 800 families in fun, interactive, multicultural learning opportunities. The FOCS online community forum involves resources sharing between over 430 families of color. \xa0In 2015-16, FOCS successfully executed five dialogues in Seattle around issues of equity on race/multiracial identity, anti-bias education, reproductive justice, and transracial adoption and included a total of 500 people and 75 volunteers. Our reach is wide and it is getting stronger. FOCS was recently awarded the Ron Chisom Anti-Racism Award by the Seattle Services Coalition for our work in racial justice for families. The ceremony was June 1,2016 at City Hall, Seattle.</p>\n\n<p>FOCS, a non-profit, was eventually founded in 2013 and it is now a women-led organization which connects parents and builds a loving community of families of color in Seattle. We\u2019ve discovered a growing demand from families of color, young parents, transracial adoptive families, multi-national,, multiracial families growing in Seattle, yet the city remains 70% white with growing displacement of families of color, immigrant and low income communities not being able to afford America\u2019s city with the quickest rising cost of living in the nation. Seattle also boosts America\u2019s largest multi-racial identifying people and also reflects where children of color are the majority nationally in Kindergarten. \xa0FOCS fosters meaningful connects, engages parents and children with cultural arts, but also providing a platform where they can discuss everything, from returning work to breastfeeding, race, community, identity and social justice. It\u2019s a powerful combination of professions, education, traditions and backgrounds. Our impact has been deep and quick, we have connected over 1000 families and trained and employed more than 35 parents as Parent Educators and Teaching Artists.</p>\n\n<p>FOCS initially opened <a href="https://www.parentmap.com/article/new-community-play-space-in-south-seattle-cornerstone-cafe" rel="nofollow noopener">Cornerstone Cafe</a> in Fall of 2014. The space offered a drop-in child care, and a cultural arts program including capoeira and Hawaiian and Spanish talk story. We now operate FOCS ARTS cultural arts programming for 0-7 year olds with parents each week, facilitate community dialogues on race and family, parenting groups for newborns and waddlers and consult and provide race and equity workshops for parents and educators at preschools and elementary schools.</p>\n\n<p>We became part of commuinity led de-gentrification of South Seattle, where our community resources reflect the historical community of residents. Instead, FOCS members are connected by the culture of inclusivity, community building and play-centered learning. Our values are women of color and mother leadership, racial equity, economic impact, dismantling racism, education equity, and an intercultural interethnic community. We envision a world where children of color are born into a loving community that is racially and economically just.</p>\n\n<p>One Filipina American mother of mixed race Filipino, Salvadorian and White two young boys said about FOCS,</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI gave birth to my first son in 2010. My pregnancy was difficult, it was unplanned, my relationship was unstable, my partner was unemployed and I suffered internal bleeding during the first trimester resulting in an emergency surgery; I often cried during my prenatal appointments, and the midwives expressed concern that I was at risk for post-partum depression and they recommended joining a parent group when my baby arrived to build a supportive community. My son arrived 3 weeks early and the birth was long and ended in a c-section. When my baby arrived I continued to face difficulty. My son was very small but healthy, but he failed to gain weight as I was unable to produce the milk he needed, and he rarely slept more than 2 hours at a time for nearly the first 6 months of his life. I had never felt more scared, tired, or overwhelmed. After 6 months I went back to my midwife with signs of Postpartum Depression and worked with my health care providers and my partner on a plan to help me manage my symptoms and the stressors in my life.</p>\n\n<p>Looking back through this experience what was missing from my life was an opportunity to build authentic relationships and community with other mothers. I was part of a parent group, but never felt like I could be myself in these groups and share what was going on in mothering experience and within myself. I often felt lonely and isolated even in the presence of the group. I attribute this experience to having a space where both mothers and partners were included as well as the facilitation of the group which focused primarily on the baby and not on the identity or needs of the parent. When I joined a FOCS (Families of Color Seattle) group last Spring, after the birth of my second son, I knew I found the place I had yearned for earlier in my motherhood. The circumstances with the birth of my second were entirely different so I was in a better place emotionally, physically, and financially, but I know that every mother still needs support and community.</p>\n\n<p>What I found with FOCS was an intentional space to build authentic relationships and community. As mothers we are welcomed in and acknowledged as whole people with cultures, professions, fears and passions, not just as care taker of a child. FOCS openly discusses and acknowledges race, ethnicity, culture, language, and identity and its importance in motherhood, parenting, and raising children. In my experience these topics were left out of other traditional parenting groups in the community. When these topics are left out, people of color and their experiences are neglected and excluded. When FOCS brings our multiple identities to the forefront the result is more authentic conversation and relationship building. My first year with my second son has been extremely positive and I attribute much of this to my on-going connection with FOCS. I felt supported as an individual and mother, and was able to transfer the love I felt to the love I share with my child. It is so important to provide support for mothers so that we can be better mothers. I believe that the strength of the community that is being built is a testimony of the need that families of color in Seattle are looking for spaces to connect".</p>', u'post_id': 531, u'user_id': 3398, u'timestamp': u'2016-09-07 07:10:21', u'title': u'Connecting Parents to Build a Loving Community of Families of Color'}, {u'content': u'<p>Interesting read and thought to share: Two UPC students design and build a low-cost wheelchair for use in developing countries.\xa0The wheelchair can be put together or taken apart in 15 minutes, costs \u20ac70 to make and is built out of two bicycle wheels, two supermarket trolley wheels and a PVC pipe to help address some of these unmet needs and make life easier for the people with motor disabilities who are most in need of assistance.</p>\n\n<p>\xa0The design of the DIY wheelchair includes two sizes, Standard and Kids, and the weight of the assembled chair ranges from 15 to 20 kg.

We spend lots of money on them on the household and institutional budgets. Several times a day we throw away these 30 cents items, often without needing to. Every human will or have used them for years. For multinational corporations they are the sweet smell of money, for us\u2026well it depends. Surely a disaster for\xa0the environment.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>What are we talking about?</p>\n\n<p>This is the situation. You are a caring person and you see tears. What\u2019s the problem?\xa0Parents know the drill. The usual detection algorithm starts. A check flowchart: pain? hunger? \u2026. or is it the \u2018bottom line\u2019?</p>\n\n<p>The sweet or not so-sweet smell tells you what you have to do.</p>\n\n<p>You will also know about the silent-positive; no alarm and no change leads\xa0to a pain in the bottom. We dry the tears and invest in curing the wounds. Soon this leads you to adopt the institutional approach.</p>\n\n<p>The institutional approach is to change at specific times, whether needed or not. The vacant slot is usually before feeding and ofthen clean ones goes to pollute our dump-yard. What goes in, must come out and then the sh.t hits the fan. The unscheduled aftermath sometimes goes undetected (silent-positive).\xa0This scheme goes for our elderly as well. The poor person is left unchanged.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>You know what we are talking about here, don\u2019t you? DIAPERS. Those wonderful disposable ones that have released tremendous time resources, given\xa0mothers time to breathe,\xa0for which, we gladly pay the price.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>What\u2019s the problem? The issues are 1. many times diapers are changed un-necessarily and 2. many times they are NOT changed at the right moment. First case is a waste of money and environmental resources. Second case is health hazard (especially for the elderly).</p>\n\n<p>The theoretical solution is simple: Change when needed.</p>\n\n<p>In practice: you can\u2019t go around sniffing there every 20 minutes, especially not as institutional employee.</p>\n\n<p>Solution:</p>\n\n<p>With cheap modern technology you could easily make a \u2018pamper sniffer\u2019 (please be aware of active patents). This 10\u20ac sniffer would signal yellow (a drop of pee is absorbed so it\u2019s not yet urgent) red (the sh.t has hit the fan, change now). Those IOT freaks will upgrade to an app telling the carer: what, who, and the GPS coordinates of the sinner.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Critical obstacle:</p>\n\n<p>You think Mr. Pumpers will sponsor a 50% reduction of his profit?</p>\n\n<p>Opportunity:\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Someone could get very rich, society will save and environment spared.

The very nice volunteer Berivan showed us around and we had the chance to talk directly with the people.</p>\n\n<p>The first time we visited I was surprised how \u201egood\u201c the atmosphere was. I somehow always thought a refugee camp would be a very sad place, but children were running around playing and everyone was kind of open and nice to each other (from my point of view).\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The ICC Messe is a former congress centrum which was recently rebuilt\xa0to be a refugee camp. The Big Main Hall is segmented with thin white walls into something like 40 rooms that look like roofless boxes. Instead of doors there are blankets and towels covering the entrances. There are no windows; in this main Hall the light comes from tubes in the ceiling.\xa0Inside of each room there are 4 bunk beds, so in total 8 people per room\xa0(familys are usually separated and live in private rooms, also: the rooms are separated by gender).</p>\n\n<p>Usually the rooms don't have any kind of furniture inside, but the one we were sitting in had a big picnic table and a bench and also a bunch of office chairs. We got offered very sweet black Tea in plastic cups and started sharing stories.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Firstly we asked how people organize themselves in the room.</p>\n\n<p>The Camp is designed for people to stay around three months, but most of the people are staying six or more. There are only the bare necessities provided. For example there are no possibilities to unpack the backpacks or suitcases, which are probably unpacked since the beginning of the journey. Thats why the people find solutions, for example they pull out nails from the wall and hang their cloth on these nails. Or they found a piece of metal string which they also used to hang cloth from. There are also some card boxes used as bed table and chest. Hussam (who is diligently learning German) pointed at one of the card boxes saying \u201eK\xfchlschrank\u201c. We were laughing but it was true! tomatoes, cans of beans and a lot of eggs were stored\xa0there. Also under the bed was a lot of food (maybe the darkest and coldest spot in the room). The reason for that is that they don't always like food by the caterer and of course you get hungry between the official \u201emeals\u201c. They boil the eggs in a water cooker by the way!\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting observation was a little plastic cup full of washing powder.(they usually give the dirty cloth away to the washing and get them back clean) Hussam told us that he likes his shirts to be without creases and because there is no way to iron,he washes them with his hands and drys them in the room. That was eye opening for me because, yes they might have nothing but they have dignity and preferences! they start a living.</p>\n\n<p>Also very interesting is that in the bunk beds the bottom bed is the preferred bed because they can build a little privacy by hanging towels and sheets at the upper bed. The upper bed is always dependent on the main light system which is switched off at 11 in the night.</p>\n\n<p>Berivan told us that in one room they build constructions out of a broken bunk bed so that also the upper bed could shield from the light.</p>\n\n<p>Another very striking construction was a piece of wood sticked to the wall with duct tape which was supposed to be a smartphone shelf, to watch movies at night.</p>\n\n<p>Also they put pictures from magazines on the wall to make the atmosphere a little more cosy.</p>\n\n<p>But still even if they find the possibility to hack something there is a lot of stuff just flying around in the room.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There was a lot of creativity to make the most out of the given, bit still no tools or materials. </strong>Berivan told us they used to give out tools, but because they never came back so there are no tools anymore.\xa0What if we could support the already existing creativity by opening a space for tools and materials? encouraging them with their ideas and hacks?</p>", u'post_id': 681, u'user_id': 3242, u'timestamp': u'2016-05-16 17:24:04', u'title': u'Home, sweet Home'}, {u'content': u'<p>As a global- world citizen I find Switzerland IDEAL for my needs to interact with others around the world.

She was born in 2007 with an extremely rare and complex heart defect. We flew around the world to find a solution for her heart to function as close to normality and we found it. In 2008 in Boston, on the day she was discharged from the hospital with a fixed heart, we discovered she is profoundly deaf. Acquired deafness from the many medical procedures and medication she had for supporting her heart function in her\xa0first months of life. Right now she is a perfectly normal 9 years old and her hearing is provided by a cochlear implant. The journey to normality was not over yet. Cochlear implants provide only the access to sound, but the brain needs to get used to decoding the sounds it receives. So going down that tortuous road and understanding how a late diagnosis can make auditory-verbal rehabilitation\xa0much harder,\xa0I started thinking about solutions for\xa0children who are already diagnosed and also for those\xa0that will to be born and possibly suffer from\xa0congenital hearing loss.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In 2013 I started an NGO - Asociatia Sonia Maria, willing to get involved\xa0in providing solutions for children with hearing loss and congenital cardiac diseases. I counselled families of children born with congenital complex cardiac diseases in order to access health care abroad. I helped them transfer their children to a cardiac centre in Munich, Germany where their health issues met the needed medical care. Parents reached out to me for advice and\xa0support, I helped them contact the clinic and maintain the contact with medical staff abroad. Other times I just I brought medication that was not available in my home country\xa0or found a connections in countries where needed medication was available and managed\xa0bringing it to Romania. This saved my daughter\u2019s life at birth, and other children further on. At times I flew with families to Germany, discussed with doctors and supported them during the hard times their children underwent complex surgeries. Once we started dealing with hearing loss, it\xa0broadened my area of issues that needed to be addressed.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In 2015 I opened Casa Koala, the first family centred auditory-verbal centre in Romania, with the help of an Australian speech therapist. Viktorija McDonnel\xa0relocated in Bucharest for two months to help us kick start the project. In Romania there is no other rehabilitation\xa0centre especially designed for children with hearing loss wearing cochlear implants. We hold individual weekly sessions in the centre and for children living in remote areas we provide tele practice. Children and their families have the opportunity to access this\xa0program especially created to help families of deaf\xa0children\xa0on their road to learning to listen and speak. With a team of three people we try to change the way in which families relate to\xa0therapy. We\xa0are trying to\xa0build\xa0a community of people who are informed, counselled and supported on their path to speech rehabilitation.</p>\n\n<p>Having access to information and seeing how much harder it is for children to acquire speech when they are diagnosed at a late age, I am making efforts to create a Bill that will implement mandatory neonatal hearing screening in all the maternities in Romania. This will mean that\xa0all the children born deaf will\xa0be diagnosed at birth and\xa0they will have the best chance in receiving the proper medical care, the devices that will give them full access to sounds and further on a fair chance in rehabilitation.</p>', u'post_id': 723, u'user_id': 3381, u'timestamp': u'2016-08-24 22:32:40', u'title': u'Creating an alternative rehabilitation system for children wearing a cochlear implant in Romania'}, {u'content': u'<p>I\'m an Interior Architect, Business Woman, Mother and active citizen. I have been running my own Design business for the past 9 years ever since I have left the corporate hospitality world. I started with my company Design2Style in partnership with my Husband, designing residential &amp; interiors and developing brand design for companies. Over time, my interest and knowledge of design thinking and strategy increased, gaining experience in projects and from attending various conferences on the subject, which resulted in moving forward, evolving personally and professionally. I launched Belgium Design Council, which applies design thinking on the project\'s infrastructural level. This allowed me to move from aesthetic design to applying design thinking processes in \u2018designing\u2019 communities.</p>\n\n<p>We\'re working on several projects at the moment. I\'ve got increasingly interested in Business Improvement District concept over the last couple of years, which existed since the 1960\u2019s/70\u2019s in the Northern America, and concentrated on socio-economical regeneration for business and communities as a whole. The combination of a geographical zone including businesses, community, people and the collaboration of those elements creating successful public, private and citizen partnerships, in order to enhance people\'s lives and environments. Creating sustainable socio/economic regeneration. BIDs and similar partnerships have been launched around the world - in Sweden, Scotland, Germany, England - and one of them is our non-profit organization of BIDs Belgium. We\'re also planning to launch BID EU in the near future, in order to create a platform for sharing best practices with each other and filter these down to ground level. I\'m planning to concentrate on specific target groups - besides the regular social innovation aspect, there will also be the social inclusion of elderly, youth, special needs people and on ways in which we can involve them and make them feel more as a part of the community. There is a plan for the pilot version to be launched in September in my own community in Brussels, Koekelberg, in collaboration with the municipality. We will address the project to both 300 businesses of this district and 3 other neighboring districts.</p>\n\n<p>We have also been developing and presenting the general information and interactive sessions for the BIDs in Brussels. We invited architects, developers, retailers, freelancers and members of the communities and explained the concept, but also ask them for feedback. There has\xa0been positive feedback and some are really keen on implementing, but they need guidance - and we want to prepare and adapt the framework which has been shared by other BID countries, which would be useful and simplify the launching of BIDs across Belgium. The model works this way: by defining the geographical zone, having a collaborative approach to working together as a community, whilst addressing the issue that is of priority and defining the projects for that area. BIDs can be supported by a levy that business owners, citizens, and the municipality contributes to. Crowd-funding has also been used to support local projects. Some cities have it already in Belgium, albeit these are a slightly different models - Mechelen and Ghent for example. The BID is a non-profit organization, with a task force representation with an open source, collaborative and transparent approach and it needs to be inclusive of the Open Care element.</p>\n\n<p>I also have a personal project close to my heart - in which Belgium Design Council works on also. It\'s about special needs children. As there is a personal background to it - one of my sons is nearly 11 yrs old and\xa0is autistic, with emotional and behavior regulation challenges. As we have been dealing with this since he was 2 yrs old, I have observed there is a big gap between what\'s available on the grassroots level for parents and at an institutional level. There is no support in the communities for parents with children with special needs for example. This personal project is about injecting more tools and awareness with creating more inclusive care in the communities themselves - also by using design thinking and visual tools, beyond pictograms available online. I have realized how much sensory input and additional energy my son needs and how much its presence could help him move around and understand things better - and visual designers and illustrators could greatly help such children. As Belgium Design Council we are planning now to fill this gap - one way is to work with the schools where children with special attend. \xa0Our son will be changing to a further\xa0specialised school closer to our\xa0home now. I have spoken\xa0with the principal\xa0and he is very interested some of the creative\xa0inclusive projects I have suggested,\xa0but the school has\xa0no time to initiate these - I have the experience and the knowledge and wish gather some support from other parents and see if we can move forward. Same for the people in the municipality, who are very much interested in this kind of work.</p>\n\n<p>My Husband and I are also heavily involved in another nonprofit organization in Brussels and volunteer at a local football club, with over 300 youth from various backgrounds. We also have a goal of making this youth more inclusive and open - both for children with special needs, but also for refugees, who get refused from other football clubs around the city for example. We will introduce the first refugee children into the club for the coming season, which we are very proud of, as we see this as part of the wider community work we are involved in.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that the initiatives, such as BIDs, should, in fact, be initiated by the city itself - and whenever I speak with the politicians, they understand it but resources and knowledge bases are at times limited. It can be challenging when systems and organizations need to change, understand and adopt design thinking themselves in order to be open for such initiatives and collaborations between private, public and citizens. The concept and ideas can appear too complicated, too political, too new and disruptive, yet many cities around the world are seeing the value this can bring.</p>\n\n<p>This is why we decided to be active citizens, to get involved in various initiatives we are working on, pulling in our network and knowledge base - and turn things around by, inspiring, collaborating and sharing information, including enlisting more volunteers from the football club to the BIDs projects, showing that non-hierarchical organisations welcome everyone. It\'s important to talk, share, bring people together, because it\'s part of the process of change - and this is where OpenCare comes as a partner.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Do you design better communities yourself?

I\u2019ve worked a lot with refugees, doing legal orientation, helping them to find houses, jobs, but also writing projects to get funds to create new spaces of inclusion.</p>\n\n<p>For me it\u2019s interesting to see how many edgeryders are interested in migration or refugee issues and what are the connections to spring up from the many well known problems of working with refugees. I think that it\u2019s possible to underline some key issues when talking about care in this context .</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Helping Relationships vs Peer Relationships</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Know your rights vs Rights as a cage</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Intercultural problems and Empathy</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Inclusiveness in our society/community: avoid ideological and too theoretical approach</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>A little bit about my experience: In particular I would like to speak about my working period during the so called \u201cNorth \xa0Africa Emergency\u201d for 3 years. It was a really hard situation for our (Italian) reception system. We were in the paradoxical situation to tell them: \u201cyou are an asylum seeker, you HAVE to be an asylum seeker, if you want to have any chances to stay in Europe\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>In effect after the Arab Spring Revolution (2011) everything changed. A lot of people that came from Horn of Africa or from other Sub Saharian regions and were in Libya for work decided to come in Europe. Gaddafi\u2019s death meant the end of every agreement \u201cPetrol vs Migrants\u201d that Italian Government had signed with Berlusconi in 2009 (for more details, this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/14/gaddafi-berlusconi-refugees-human-rights" rel="nofollow noopener">Guardian article</a>). So you\u2019d have more asylum seekers in Europe, but also different routes, different countries of origin, different reasons to leave their countries.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011 asylum seekers in Italy were more than 40.000 (4 times more than 2010, <a href="http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=migr_asyappctza&amp;lang=en" rel="nofollow noopener">Eurostat</a>) and Italy became the fourth country for the number of claims submitted, mainly from Nigeria,Tunisia, Ghana and Mali. Most of them have lived for many years in Libya, illiterate in their own native language, living in segregated conditions of work or in the terrible detention centers.</p>\n\n<p>The history is long and I\u2019 don\u2019t want to become boring, but <strong>only to say that it\u2019s not possible to speak about refugees in general when trying to be of real help.</strong> We have to think about the countries where we are and where they come from (for example 90% of Syrian refugees that arrived in Italy decided not to ask asylum here, but in other north EU countries), the migration routes, the particular war conditions, but also the economical ones..</p>\n\n<p>For all these reasons it was hard to prepare asylum seekers during North Africa Emergency because they came here for Lybian crisis and most didn\u2019t leave their countries for reasons of \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d (<a href="http://www.unhcr.org/protect/PROTECTION/3b66c2aa10.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Geneva Convention</a>) or for war crisis in their countries (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0083:en:HTML" rel="nofollow noopener">subsidiary protection</a>). And so it was difficult to explain them that formally they have to be asylum seekers, that we need to find these elements in their stories. How could we help them? I usually do some group or individual meetings to inform them about procedures, about what does it mean to ask asylum and I prepare them for the Audition. How to help them to underline important elements in their stories, not lying... A lot of also ethical questions..(Legislation vs Reality)</p>\n\n<p><strong>A relation of care: teaching a foreign language</strong></p>\n\n<p>The relations between us is a relation of help. Sometimes you can help someone too much.</p>\n\n<p>The question is more to create opportunities for people to be really active (refugees as #nospectators). There are language barriers, cultural misunderstandings, different contexts of life, different expectations.</p>\n\n<p>In this complex and nonlinear context of work that I would like to start from the first point: the challenge to learn a new language, the language of the recipient country. It could be difficult and, in some situations, also impossible, like a WALL.</p>\n\n<p>This could be because learning a language means that you accept to be in a country, you decide to start again your life. For a lot of vulnerable people that are victims of violence (in their countries of origin or during the migration travel) it could become a catalyst of bed experiences.</p>\n\n<p>So learning a language becomes the first step to say: \u201cI\u2019m here. I would like to take part in this new society and new community.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>For all these reasons we needed to share knowledge and experiences about \u201chow to teach in more effective way?\u201d, we needed to create a community - or better to create a space for a community of italian schools! So we started with: <a href="http://www.milano.Italianostranieri.org" rel="nofollow noopener">www.milano.Italianostranieri.org</a></p>\n\n<p>It is a platform of the Municipality of Milan to help foreigners find a school of Italian; there are a lot of problems to find the right schools, also because there are a lot of schools but not connected.</p>\n\n<p>We saw that there is this tendency to work alone, providing a service but without \xa0sharing knowledge, critical points.. We knew people that attend 3 different classes, for months, \xa0but they couldn\u2019t speak Italian!</p>\n\n<p>So we decided to open our website to every school, private, public, run by volunteers, by NGOs.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not simple to help, to take care of someone. It\u2019s a relation full of responsibilities, and good intentions often aren\u2019t enough. We noticed also some schools that are so active in helping their students, helping them in legal stuff or finding jobs.. But all these activities could be dangerous, create a bubble, a dependence relation, mixed with ideological thoughts ..</p>\n\n<p>Your students are not yours.</p>\n\n<p>To create a community we realized \xa0real life meetings between teachers and schoolmakers. Every school has the possibility to post directly activities, news. So everyone can have an always updated map of time classes, levels, locations etc; But also a moment of exchange between teachers, methods and materials. The teachers all together wrote also an <a href="http://milano.italianostranieri.org/it/pg/guida-intergalattica-per-il-pianeta-l2" rel="nofollow noopener">handbook for teachers (in Italian only)</a>. We also created an <a href="http://milano.italianostranieri.org/it/search/e-learning" rel="nofollow noopener">e-learning database</a> to help people to find free resources on internet and a lot of <a href="http://milano.italianostranieri.org/ar/post/mrf-at-lytly-at-mn-jl-lmysh-at-wlml-f~-ytly" rel="nofollow noopener">videos (in 5 languages) to explain Laws. Education system...</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>I\u2019ve been asked what projects I think can really make a difference: </strong>Projects that work on the concept of <a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic920418.files/arc_1_10refandpsych-1.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">resilience,</a>\xa0avoid that people identify themselves with their own pain.</p>\n\n<p>We saw a lot of people that 5 or 6 months after their arrival start to fade, to turn off. During the first months you hope that your rights became effective, job, home.. But nothing happens. Your life becomes full of complaints.</p>\n\n<p>A very interesting school that is part of the community is for example, <a href="http://milano.italianostranieri.org/it/locations/asnada-onlus" rel="nofollow noopener">Asnada</a>. It\u2019s a Montessori/Experimental\xa0school. The idea is to teach in a different way. Helping people to use this new language not as a \u201cstranger\u201d language. Usually you start to have 2 languages: the native one that is the language of feelings and relationships and a second language that is the language of bureaucracy. The idea is to teach a language that helps you to construct your new identity, \u201ccreate your new life here in a new language\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>So the lessons became a workshop where we, all together, construct the language, with different ways, methods (arts, music, plays..) and also being a community.</p>\n\n<p>So in my opinion it\u2019s really important to be able to find new ways to take care, creating effective spaces of meeting, of real exchange.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Work on resilience, opening workshops where people can create something (for ex. FabLabs, Makerspaces..) using open technologies (like Raspberry Pi) could become new ways to take care of people in really big troubles, with strong vulnerabilities and help them to start again.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Maybe Opencare, Edgeryders community could be the right place where to start!!</p>\n\n<p>What do you think?</p>', u'post_id': 515, u'user_id': 3324, u'timestamp': u'2016-07-25 09:44:02', u'title': u'Italianostranieri: why learning and teaching a foreign language for refugees is a form of CARE'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 5838, u'user_id': 3364, u'timestamp': u'2016-08-11 08:33:12', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<h1><b>Doctor.. could you hack me a neuroprosthesis, please?</b></h1>\n\n<p>(The thoughts expressed here are a personal view and do not reflect the opinion of former or current employers)</p>\n\n<p>When I was a little boy, in 1973, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Up,&lt;em&gt;Stand&lt;/em&gt;Up" rel="nofollow noopener">Bob Marley was singing Get Up, Stand up for your rights</a> and the article <a href="http://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jour/73/10/2/75.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">"Functional electrical stimulation - A new hope for paraplegic patients?" was published</a>. Now, 40 year on, as a senior researcher in rehabilitation engineering I look back on things that are still true: people still fight and patients still hope. Can we improve life conditions, and how? A fundamental question is: do we meet the \u2018clients\u2019 needs?</p>\n\n<p>Just to give an example: \xa0My mother suffered from a slipped disc so passing the vacuum cleaner was a low back pain for her. As a good boy I stated: "When I grow up mom, I\u2019ll invent a cleaning robot to do the job for you". Someone beat me to it - <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US7769490" rel="nofollow noopener">the cleaning robot is a reality</a> - it sells well, and substitutes the socializing cleaning woman once offered to the elderly. I see now that a cleaning robot is not what a mother really wants. She just wants a good boy saying: \u201cmom, I\'ll do that part of the cleaning with you\u201d, and do it right away.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://mecfes.wikispaces.com/Doctorate+thesis+and+first+experiments" rel="nofollow noopener">Until doing my masters</a>, the disabled people were an unknown phenomenon to me.

Together we coined a method, not an ambitious cure, just a simple idea that could help a bit and during my Ph.D dissertation, we <a href="http://ifess.org/proceedings/IFESS1997/IFESS1997_073_Thorsen.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">demonstrated feasibility of restoring the hand function</a> using electrical activation of the paralysed muscles.

Is the problem (as some people with SCI have entrusted me) that there is no such demand or \u2018new hope\u2019 for walking? After all, wheels are more efficient than legs - provided accessibility!!!</p>\n\n<p>Another hypothesis could be an issue of lack of flexibility of the healthcare system, not beeing able to provide state of the art technology to patients !?</p>\n\n<p>Still, for more than forty years we continue producing scientific publications with conclusions like: \u201c\u2026the work carried out so far proves that functional movements can be restored...We therefore believe that patients can benefit. <a href="http://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jour/73/10/2/75.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Further research should be carried out</a>\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Please, don\u2019t get me wrong. The research contribute with important results, but obviously there is a problem of transferring the research results into the benefit of people with physical challenges.</p>\n\n<p>So far business oriented people responds that it\u2019s because the solutions are not technically good enough, that they only fit a few thousand patients and we continue <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23080037" rel="nofollow noopener">the research for enhancements to the technology and demonstrate clinically effectiveness</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13761879" rel="nofollow noopener">less ambitious solutions have been available since the 60\u2019ties, to alleviate the simple problem of foot drop. It applies to thousands of people living with stroke, multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury</a>. <a href="/t/fes-for-foot-drop/667">It\u2019s a little electrical device providing electrical impulses to the muscle that lifts the foot and I\u2019ve encountered many people with stroke and multiple sclerosis who gained significantly in mobility (see this user statement).</a></p>\n\n<p>Despite demonstrated clinical efficiency and the immediate advantages it\u2019s almost never proposed to the patients of the health care system (except for the UK [11]). Why???</p>\n\n<p>So on the one hand we spend <a href="http://musculardystrophynews.com/tag/kessler-foundation/" rel="nofollow noopener">million dollar research</a> to refine technology that is not widely used!!!!. Will <a href="https://youtu.be/H1iu_oI2ghw?t=634" rel="nofollow noopener">our institutions and society implement the provision of such technology</a>!?</p>\n\n<p>They need one solution that fits many, because the modern health care model reduce human life in cost/benefit analysis to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year" rel="nofollow noopener">numbers</a>. However, as long as assistive technology is not used it\u2019s difficult to identify exactly where to improve it. \xa0We know that consumers must be involved early in the development, it\u2019s difficult to do so in a realistic setting. We realize that marketing assistive technology is different than selling a robot vacuum cleaner.</p>\n\n<p>So a relatively simple method of restoring the hand function in people having broken their neck (cervical spinal cord injury), that has been demonstrated useful in a <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2013/836959/" rel="nofollow noopener">large clinical trial</a> has not become available to people who really need it because it does not fit the \u2018business model\u2019 \xa0of modern health care systems !?</p>\n\n<p>As an example we experienced that half the participants wanted to take the experimental device with them home. We are not allowed to do that. I\u2019ve only spend around 50 euro to build the prototype in the laboratory, but we are not in the 1970\u2019ies anymore. In the name of assuring \u2018quality\u2019, \u2018safety\u2019 etc, \xa0we need to manufacture, CE mark, register as a medical device and so on!. \xa0To provide a patient with a medical device we need to spend hundreds of thousands of euros on paperwork!!! And who is then going to sell at a reasonable price. \xa0Why should people, already challenged economically by loss of health, <a href="/t/fes-for-foot-drop/667">spend 5-10 k\u20ac </a>\xa0for a device that could be made much cheaper?</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s where the revolution of <a href="/t/project/4861">OpenCare </a>\u2013with a subset of community driven provision of assistive technology - comes in.</p>\n\n<p>Could we leave people with a physical handicap to become a maker, create their own assistive technology?</p>\n\n<p>Would it be possible for, for example, researchers to help people living with a disability to hack a dropped foot correcting device like <a href="https://youtu.be/rSQNi5sAwuc?t=78" rel="nofollow noopener">connecting an Arduino with an extension board</a>?</p>\n\n<p>Will doctors provide indications of how to find the assistive technology, which might solve your health issue?</p>\n\n<p>That would mean that people should take responsibility for their own rehabilitation devices. They would have full ownership. Clearly they must be guided by healthcare professionals and experts without conflict of interests to ensure that everything is done ethically, safe and sound.

Ever since we were diagnosed with cancer until the end of our treatment we both were more than convinced our body could fight this and we eventually would win the battle. We were always pretty fanatic with sports and always had a focus on eating healthy. We immediately started to look for information on how to keep our body in the best shape during the chemo and radiation attack. During the first appointments we had at the hospital with a nurse specialized in cancer treatment, we received a lot of information on the treatment itself and its possible side effects. However, there was no information added on (healthy) food, which products to eat best during treatment or information on the possibility to continue exercising.</p>\n\n<p>At home our search started at the internet and we looked up questions like: Is it healthy to sport during treatment? What is the best food to eat? Should we be adding supplements to our daily meals? Who can help to keep my body in the best shape?</p>\n\n<p>Through the dietician working at the general practitioners office Carry got a first list of products, which could affect the treatment and also some products to prevent loosing too much weight. We did not know if we had to expect a weight loss, because that is what we all think chemo does to your bodies. What we forget is that you get a lot of medicines to fight the treatment side effects, which have again their own side effects, such as potentially gaining weight (take for example prednisone, one tends to store a lot of body liquids that could cause weight increase).</p>\n\n<p>The information from the GPs dietician was not sufficient, therefore we asked for the advice of a dietician at the hospital. During the first appointment we asked all kinds of different questions, but we were shocked by the answers. Before we were ill, we ate very healthy, fresh/fair products, now we got the advice of the hospital dietician to buy ready meals in case we would did not feel well enough to cook. Or in case you would lose weight to eat artificially manufactured nutrition containing ingredients to increase weight.</p>\n\n<p>Currently there are all kinds of \u2018food fanatics\u2019 and \u2018health hypes\u2019. We are convinced that healthy food should not be a trend. We don\u2019t want to focus on trends or hypes; our focus lies at informing people about healthy food and \u201cback to basic\u201d. We want to reach the target group of cancer patients, to help them in finding good food to fight the battle of their life. As we experienced ourselves, medical specialists at the hospital don\u2019t have enough time to guide a patient in the best way and many dieticians follow the \u2018old\u2019 rules and are promoting the medical food of the pharmaceutics industry.</p>\n\n<p>We want to start a foundation, which will have a wide network of researchers, specialized food coaches, sport coaches and doctors to gather information and advice, on how to compose healthy menu\u2019s for cancer patients and provide information on healthy ways of exercising during your illness. Not only in general, but also customized, for each individual. Our plan is to set up an overview listing healthy products to eat during your treatment, but also listing products, that are particularly unhealthy.</p>\n\n<p>Next to that we want build up a network to reach out to people who cannot cook or are not able to exercise (or just walk) on their own. Look around to your own environment. If you were aware that there is a single man/woman, who lives a couple of streets away, which is not able to cook because he/she is too ill, would you not cook (needless to say that this needs to be in line with the advice of the foundation) for that person? This is called community care.Focusing on the hospital food will be the second target (long-term). Once we start informing patients and start working with researchers, food coaches, sport coaches and doctors, we will eventually be able to slowly change the hospital food.</p>\n\n<p>Figuring out the healthiest ways to fight your battle by staying in direct contact with your target group is part of specialized care, which would be the future in health care. Not general, but focus on single patients with their own problems/questions and side effects.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>\n\n<p>(Customized) advice serving cancer patients during treatment (chemo, radiation,\u2026) to ensure optimal nutrition and exercise.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>focusing on natural instead of artificially produced ingredients</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>emphasizing the importance of regular and moderately intensive exercise.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Channels</strong></p>\n\n<p>Short-term: online (info and community)</p>\n\n<p>Long-term: face to face (workshops on two main subjects)</p>\n\n<p>Activities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>develop and maintain a blog/website/platform with menu proposals containing healthy ingredients, working together with food coaches and researchers on this.

We are convinced that the magic happens by connecting citizen\u2019s skills and needs. We aim to become a laboratory for urban change hosting citizens in search of anchor.\u2019</p>\n\n<p>But Huis VDH doesn\u2019t fall from the sky. For me, being in good care in the city has always meant having a healthy living environment. To create such a good environment we need good city planners and a great vision on public space. Something Brussels is still lacking...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Once upon a time, there was public space.</strong></p>\n\n<p>From 2012\xa0onwards, I got fascinated by the concept of public space and how to bring it back in the center of everyday life in the city. After reading <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHU9aLPyxf0" rel="nofollow noopener">a call</a> by philosopher Philippe Van Parijs about the urge to design new ways to interact in public space because of the limits of private space in the city, I got involved in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=248368211944878&amp;fref=ts" rel="nofollow noopener">Pic Nic The Streets</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/canal.park.bxl/?fref=ts" rel="nofollow noopener">Canal Park BXL</a> that both asked the government to urgently work on citizen based public space to better the living conditions of each citizen. Both won the political battle, but the result wasn\u2019t really what we were hoping for. Pic Nic The Streets led to a carfree city center, but so poorly planned that a strong movement of anti carfree people could rise and are now threatening to stop \xa0further reorganisation of the city center. Looking at the plans for the big park, we are scared that gentrification will become an even bigger issue now in the zone around Canal Park. We were hoping for an inclusive design knowing that a lot of poor people are living in that neighbourhood. Now we are continuing to work as an observer with a cargo bike installation called <a>Canal d\u2019Accroche</a> (part of the project <a href="http://www.velom2.be" rel="nofollow noopener">V\xe9lo M2</a>, explained <a href="/t/velo-m2-using-a-modular-cargo-bike-to-find-societal-challenges-and-solve-them-together/5772">here</a>) in that neighbourhood, hoping to bring them some resilience.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/fb72ae274c533e70821cf9d4b9cb3c29b507574b" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/f/fb72ae274c533e70821cf9d4b9cb3c29b507574b.jpg" class="lightbox" title="picnic_the_streets_0.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/fb72ae274c533e70821cf9d4b9cb3c29b507574b_1_666x500.jpg" width="666" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">picnic_the_streets_0.jpg</span><span class="informations">1600x1200 606 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><b>From Maison Du People to Huis VDH, a story about citizen centred design.</b></p>\n\n<p>Since I was a guide and learned about the architect Horta and his Art Nouveau Style, I\u2019m fascinated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_du_Peuple" rel="nofollow noopener">Maison Du Peuple</a>, a building from the end of the 19th century that housed all kind of projects and people wanting to better society. It was a place where ideals could grow, and people could come listen to each other in an open dialogue. I started working on an open call to repurpose the empty Bourse building into a new Maison Du Peuple, right in the hearth of the city. But just days after finishing the text the attacks in Bataclan occurred and life in Brussels changed dramatically for a couple of weeks\u2026</p>\n\n<p>I gave it a rest and set my focus on a vacant building above the well-known music bar <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bonnefooi/" rel="nofollow noopener">Bonnefooi</a>: 4 floors, 500m2, and lots of potential, but also lots of work to be done. Without any budget or action plan, I started gathering people in the house, now called Huis VDH. The only thing I knew was that I wanted an inclusive project build from a common idea: Designing a semi-public space in such a way that the wellbeing of the neighbourhood / city improves. Huis VDH will therefore become a test case, because it isn\u2019t the first or last vacant space above a shop in Brussels: there are more than 23 000 m2 documented.</p>\n\n<p>So there we were, having a space, an open concept and a lot of potential. The first thing we did was taking time to create a common practice: we designed our way of gathering through a <a href="https://medium.com/p/using-futurism-to-detect-the-vision-of-a-collaborative-community-in-the-making-huis-vdh-c44377a3d24d" rel="nofollow noopener">futurism session</a> created by <a href="http://fo.am" rel="nofollow noopener">Fo.AM</a> that allowed us to gather all ideas from each person who wanted to get involved and, like a funnel, filter only the most common. For us, it was important to make Huis VDH as open as possible, so that any new member with the right mind-set could easily become a full involved partner in the building process. After a philosophical six months, we had the sprout of an idea: Huis VDH was born.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s all in the name, for Huis VDH it is no other. \u2018Huis\u2019 means \u2018home\u2019 in Dutch and that is what we are aiming to become for people that are drowning in a sea of complexity of city life. We try to not judge each other, but rather think solution oriented: Help out where we can, and bring the right people around the table. Our space is designed to welcome each kind of small organization working on local issues: cultural, social or technological. We try to design each space so it can be multifunctional and become a temporary rest spot for thosein search of an anchor. We believe like edgeryders: \u201c that the power of a community is bigger than the sum of all parts.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>One big challenge we will be facing in the next couple of years is to use our talent to organize ourselves within crisis. Big problems are ahead and we need to build up resilience to react quickly to an ever changing surrounding. Huis VDH is trying to take that challenge inside our own development. For us resilience can be developed on four levels: knowledge, vulnerability, out of the box exercise, and modification.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shared knowledge</strong></p>\n\n<p>Open Source is all around us, and also in Huis VDH. After living for 5 weeks in an open source innovation camp called<a> POC21</a>, I find solutions to every kind of problem through this model of thinking. Knowledge is there to be shared and if we create the right methodology we will find more easily solutions to any kind of problems. That is why we started mapping out every encounter we had through <a href="http://metamaps.cc/maps/1819" rel="nofollow noopener">metamaps</a>, we budget our work with <a href="http://metamaps.cc/maps/1819" rel="nofollow noopener">cobudget</a> and use a sharing file system inside the house.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Showing your vulnerable self</strong></p>\n\n<p>When working in a collective environment, we tend to show our better self, hiding our flaws in the first place. But a strong collective group is as strong as its weakest link, and therefore we find it important that we are open and honest to each other. Having personal problems is something common, but sharing them is less. We try to create a trust field around Huis VDH where personal development is as important as the common goal of the organization. Caring about each other as a human being before seeing it as a resource for a project. In order to bring this theory into practice, we have made the first floor as cosy as possible, so people can just hang around and talk freely to each other. We make meetings short and efficient so there is time to discuss at the bar the more intimate stuff, not with all, but with whom we trust.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Putting ourselves outside the system</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the first six months, I was convinced we could create a complete system without the need of money. Only through exchange we could rebuild the house. This gave us a clear barrier to work around, and even if after six months we partially let money in our system, we were trained to think about solutions without money by using the skills, knowledge and resources of one another. This is one of the many ways we try to build challenges to ourselves to constantly think out of the box. When crisis occurs, we need to think and find solutions fast. Creating these exercises in a calm period will help create resilience in all members.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Modification as constancy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Finally, another way resilience can be created is by being in a constantly changing environment. Therefore Huis VDH doesn\u2019t have fixed spaces. Every room can be rearranged to have a different use. Having this as one of the ground rules, we create a constant reality of change that makes us well trained in the art of adaptation, a virtue needed in times of crisis. In September, we will be, thanks to <a class="mention" href="/u/nadia">@Nadia</a>, hosting the Open Care Weekend for Brussels.We see it as an opportunity to use our space for a common goal and adapt it while having people using the space. It will be our first external happening and we are really excited.</p>\n\n<p>When working for Huis VDH, I have a phrase by Bachelard that always comes to mind: \u201cOur House is our first universe, a real cosmos in every sense of the word\u201d We can\u2019t forget about the complexity of a home when we want to harmonize it. In cosmos, planets collide, new stars are born and a black hole sometimes sucks up even galaxies. This will be the same for people, ideas and principles. The most important for the wellbeing of this microcosm will be the search for constant balance.</p>\n\n<p>In September we will be co-hosting the <a href="/t/working-out-loud-openandchange-workshops-in-thessaloniki-brussels-and-berlin/5787">Brussels OPENandChange Workshop</a> and that will kick off our Huis VDH. In the follow up we are working on a concept called Pirate Kitchen: using the resources from dumpster diving or own grown combined with hobby cooks we want to bring each week around 10 people gravitating around the same interest / problem / field but don\u2019t know or rarely meet. We wouldn\u2019t give them any explanation about whom they will meet, only that they will have a dinner with interesting \xa0people. They will have to find out why they are all here, and what they could bring to each other. A sort of blind date for change makers. Could this be an interesting form, or does it already occur in some places?</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d appreciate any feedback in a comment below, and see you on 10-11 September for the workshop! \xa0</p>\n\n<p><i>The production of this\xa0article was supported by\xa0</i><a href="/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296"><i>Op3n\xa0Fellowships</i></a><i>\xa0-\xa0an ongoing program for community contributors\xa0during May - November 2016.</i></p>', u'post_id': 520, u'user_id': 3293, u'timestamp': u'2016-08-08 15:40:37', u'title': u'Huis VDH: how can we build vacant spaces into home-like structures to build up resilience'}, {u'content': u'<p>After some tinkering, I have more information about the data structure used by OpenEthnographer.</p>\n\n<p>There are two main entities: <strong>codes</strong> and <strong>annotations</strong>.\xa0</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Codes obtain by repurposing the Drupal entity called taxonomy term from the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/taxonomy">Taxonomy core module</a>.

The Amish -\xa0a culture of independance and thrift may be a way to balance community support and individual responsibility. A cost-conscious,\xa0community-based take on American healthcare may be able to teach the general population a thing or two about dealing with a broken healthcare system. Health care practices vary considerably across Amish communities and from family to family. Many Amish use modern medical services, but others turn to alternative forms of treatment within their community. \xa0The Amish society accepts responsibility for their own actions and chooses not to depend on services offered by the state and Amish communities opt out of the government-funded insurance. Opposed to commercial insurance and they pride themselves on taking care of their own. To assist one another, they willingly offer donations when a member of their community becomes ill.\xa0It may not fit in this area, but I thought it was an interesting read a thought I would share. \xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Excerpt from the article: \xa0</strong></p>\n\n<p>Plain communities are highly interested in health education and disease prevention.\xa0Coming from an ethic of thriftiness, many Plain people distrust the motives of hospital administrators and even doctors themselves. They believe a profit motive can influence courses of treatment.

Now, I know that with you guys\xa0the\xa0ownership of the platform itself is a lot\xa0more open than with\xa0a crowdsourcing platform such as, say,\xa0<a href="http://plusacumen.org/chapters/" rel="nofollow noopener">+Acumen</a> or\xa0<a href="https://openideo.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">OpenIDEO</a>. What you\'re doing builds more on the concept of open-source rather than crowdsourcing, and you\'re implementing it in every single part of your operation. Doing this with challenges that relate to\xa0society and that are produced because of an intrinisic motivation is very impressive! Most other platforms that try to achieve change or develop new concepts do this based on streamlined extrinisic motivations, such as Kickstarter\'s rewards or simply a cash prize for the best idea.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Thus, I would really like to use Edgeryders as a case-study for my thesis. I\'m looking for at least two users of the platform to answer a few of my questions over Skype. The questions that I have are based on two models. Firstly, I am trying to find indicators for the quality of the interactions that take place on the platform based on <a href="https://books.google.nl/books?id=GO8wefdWmLIC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=prahalad+ramaswamy+co+creation+table+3+-+1&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFuoXW2aTKAhWHoA4KHRrXAEAQ6AEILTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow noopener">the framework of Prahalad and Ramaswamy</a>\xa0(2004)\xa0and, secondly,\xa0I am trying to create some insight into your overall co-creation activities based on a recent model of Malmelin and Villi (2015).\xa0</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/593153766b78698c9fefd235d919433ab33fe1de" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/5/593153766b78698c9fefd235d919433ab33fe1de.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Screen Shot 2016-07-06 at 17.27.49.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/593153766b78698c9fefd235d919433ab33fe1de_1_572x500.jpg" width="572" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Screen Shot 2016-07-06 at 17.27.49.jpg</span><span class="informations">1042x910 160 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/e3e1ed8a740d8acbd863606ee9f3cf2737affae7" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e3e1ed8a740d8acbd863606ee9f3cf2737affae7.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Screen Shot 2016-07-06 at 17.21.22.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e3e1ed8a740d8acbd863606ee9f3cf2737affae7_1_502x500.jpg" width="502" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Screen Shot 2016-07-06 at 17.21.22.jpg</span><span class="informations">910x906 95.6 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p>Even if you\'re not willing to be interviewed over Skype, it would be very helpful to me if you could describe how and why you are making use of\xa0the platform, and to which categories your\xa0activities on the platform\xa0fit or don\'t fit.

big data and algorithms, Edgeryders has chosen to walk the path of human-powered collective intelligence</strong>.\xa0We believe collective intelligence is interactional: smart, intellectually honest people are more likely to get closer to an accurate analysis, or to come up with a workable plan for something, when they are in conversation with each other. We exploit the property of\xa0open\xa0interaction to weed\xa0out errors and personal biases; this effect gives rise to\xa0Wikipedia\'s famous <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~fviegas/papers/history_flow.pdf">self-correcting properties</a>.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, we keep being awestruck by the power of result-oriented conversations as a knowledge engine. People will turn a problem in their head, make conjectures, explore them, use each conjecture to quickly generate alternative ones and explore\xa0<em>them</em>\xa0too, look for supporting evidence to reference, try small experiments, involve others. They are unafraid of\xa0exploring\xa0poorly defined questions, if they are interesting enough ("how can we defeat the tyranny of the mortgage?"); in fact, they can help define it, and even\xa0turn the original question on its head ("what you are <em>really</em> asking is XYZ"). It\'s uncanny.</p>\n\n<p>Here\'s the problem: on the Internet (and in a friendly-but-tough, result-oriented social environment like Edgeryders)\xa0an open conversation very quickly becomes too large to keep in any individual human head. Since inception, we have needed ways to summarize\xa0the point of view not of individuals, but of the community in conversation, and to do it in a scientifically sound, accountable way.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hence, ethnography</strong>. Ethnographers have the\xa0appropriate tools for the job. Just as importantly,\xa0they have the right research ethos for Edgeryders: ethnography\'s definitional attribute is "no research\xa0<em>on</em>\xa0a group without encoding the point of view\xa0<em>of\xa0</em>the group". This encodes a healthy degree of respect for the community trying to solve a problem, or to address a research question. We like that. Too many researchers have an extractive attitude towards "the crowd", seen as a rightless volunteer in collective intelligence exercises.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><a href="/t/welcome/5345">OpenCare</a>, too, has found its ethnographer. <strong>I am proud to announce that <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/hasso008">Amelia Hassoun</a> will be working with us on this\xa0project</strong>.

An way to draw cool air into homes using plastic bottles, using raw materials and the  creating a benefit to the community:</p>\n\n<p>here\'s the story:</p>\n\n<h3>How Bangladeshi inventors are making eco-friendly air conditioners from plastic bottles</h3>\n\n<p>What can you make with old plastic bottles? A vase? A flowerpot? \u2026 an air-conditioning unit? Believe it or not, you can. When inventor Ashis Paul came up with an innovative way to draw cool air into homes using plastic bottles, his whole company got on board to help teach people living in rural Bangledesh to do the same. Since February this year, they\u2019ve helped people to install these units-- which don\u2019t need electricity to function-- in more than 25,000 households in developing areas of the country.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMost people live in tin huts\u2026 in the summer, it\u2019s like being in sauna in the Sahara\u201d</p>\n\n<a href="http://observers.france24.com/en/contributor/jaiyyan-huq" title="Jaiyyanul Huq" rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt="Jaiyyanul Huq" src="https://d1lqe9temigv1p.cloudfront.net/img/9d4c6a56fa88f1b53ab681a4f8e03639277825cd.jpg" width="674" height="690"></a><h4><a href="http://observers.france24.com/en/contributor/jaiyyan-huq" rel="nofollow noopener">Jaiyyanul Huq</a></h4>\n\n<p>Jaiyyanul Huq is a creative director with the Grey Group, the advertising company that spearheaded <a href="http://grey.com/apac/work/key/eco-cooler/id/12475/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">this social project</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>We are a flood-prone nation, so in rural Bangladesh, most people build their homes out of tin, instead of mud. About 70% of Bangladesh\'s population lives in these homes. But the problem with these tin huts is that they get unbearably hot in the summer, especially in northern and central Bangladesh. I\u2019ve been in these huts. It\u2019s like being in a sauna in the Sahara. \n\n<p>One of our creative supervisors, Ashis Paul, started thinking about ways to bring relief to these people. He was turning it over in his mind when one day, he overheard his daughter\u2019s physics tutor explaining to her how gas cools when it expands quickly. Ashis has an "inventor" mentality and he\u2019s always been fascinated by science. So, he started experimenting. </p>\n\n<p>He told us about his idea of making an air-conditioner out of plastic bottles. The simplicity of the Eco-Cooler is incredible. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<img alt src="http://scd.observers.france24.com/files/imagecache/observers_full_width/rfi_multimedia_element_image/ashis.paul_.jpg" width="520" height="347"> \n\n<p>Ashis Paul designed the Eco cooler. </p>\n\n<p>How to Make an Eco-Cooler </p>\n\n<img alt src="http://scd.observers.france24.com/files/imagecache/observers_full_width/rfi_multimedia_element_image/eco-cooler.04.jpg" width="520" height="347"> \n\n<p>To make an Eco-Cooler, you cut plastic bottles in half and then mount them on a board. </p>\n\n<img alt src="http://scd.observers.france24.com/files/imagecache/observers_full_width/rfi_multimedia_element_image/eco.cooler003.jpg" width="520" height="293"> \n\n<p>Then, you place the board over a window, with the bottlenecks facing towards the inside of the house. </p>\n\n<img alt src="http://scd.observers.france24.com/files/imagecache/observers_full_width/rfi_multimedia_element_image/eco.cooler13.jpg" width="520" height="293"> \n\n<p>The change in pressure that occurs when air enters the wider part of the bottle and comes out through the bottleneck cools the air. </p>\n\n<p>It seems uncanny, but the principle is simple. Blow on your hand with your mouth wide open. The air feels hot, doesn\u2019t it? Now, blow on your hand with your lips pursed.

We like to give back -- it\u2019s core to our company. We decided to make and distribute these units for free. We designed the first prototype in March last year and finally finalised it at the end of February this year.

We sent our teams out to the villages where Grameen Intel works to teach people how to make our Eco-Coolers. </p>\n\n<img alt src="http://scd.observers.france24.com/files/imagecache/observers_full_width/rfi_multimedia_element_image/eco-cooler.03.jpg" width="520" height="347"> \n\n<p>The beauty of it all is how easy these units are to make.

As <a class="mention" href="/u/pavlos">@Pavlos</a>\xa0said, since he was a kid he saw degradation all around - his little coastal hometown, in North-Eastern Greece, surrounded by olive orchards, was always the reference point of a good life in a good space. Seeing the country devastated by urban sprawl, beaches consumed by villas and bars, and people being happy about this, worried him since a long time. So, after receiving education in Scotland, Germany, and researching native tribes of China and Thailand, he didn\'t only come back to Greece to rethink its food culture. He also decided to work on the climate.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Pavlos is involved with climatetracker.org, an international team of young writers and quite possibly the biggest environmental youth movement of people from all around the world. These are decentralized and nonhierarchical groups led by activists in the Carribean, Europe, Latin America. They cover events in UN or COPs but also do investigative journalism on a local scale. Their work unmasks lobbies and harmful practices and has been published in key media across the globe. They also organize webinars and campaigns and often encourage writers to concentrate on a certain issue in a given period of time.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>And Pavlos has an idea. Greece can become a hotspot of international dialogue on sustainability and resilience. As the country struggles with, as Pavlos has beautifully put it, "restoring the zombie economy", it innovates and experiments along the way. The social innovation and solidarity, however highly spontaneous and uncoordinated, are the backbone for the change. What would be necessary now is to organize those in collaboration with the right minds from all over the world in order to use the whole potential of this change and build a national economy that is regenerative and sustainable?\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Even though Greek politicians and intellectuals in many cases seem stuck decades ago and their resistance to change is huge, what\'s happening around proves its inescapable. Pavlos thinks the best for them would be to funnel the energy into protecting marginalized groups, including the refugees, to lower their costs of transition.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The Greek crisis has a side that not many people talk about - how would paying back the debt affects its environment. Pavlos believes paying off the money lent from the international institutions would create a huge ecological debt in terms of lack of sustainable land use and waste management.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Now, as the demos has been neglected and their voice hijacked during the last referendum, it\'s time to accept, at least tolerate, widespread civil disobedience that will drive the movement. 62% that disagreed has been silent so far, but it will have to speak soon. Even more, what seems to be an alternative idea, is not alternative anymore there - it\'s the only way out. Greece is exploring the open data tools and sharing knowledge, prototyping new was of accountability, transparency, decision making. And here the health and care appear again. Pavlos has seen plenty of interesting and viable practices and conclusions forming from the bottom-up, grassroots practice in Greece. These are the ways in which delivering health care has changed, in which social organization has challenged the systemic shortcomings. From those experiments and pieces emerges a complex, wide image of more inclusive future. It is built on the exchange of ideas and practices in an open manner. It rethinks the way we deliver care in a more decentralized way, more concentrated on prevention. It reframes urban food systems by educating people on the impact of what they eat on their health. Contemporary lifestyle jeopardizes 50 years of development in the health sector - food related diseases, new viruses, climate change, they all have a huge, negative impact on the quality of our lives. Technology and science, accompanied by open data and sharing, can prevent disastrous effects of those phenomena.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I asked how would he explain his entrepreneurial path to those opposing the market? He said a couple of things I find hilarious and worth considering. First of all, that activism is for city people - while he wanted to go back to his olive groves and do the farm life. Secondly, there is a dire need of changing the way people do business - in a sustainable way, with respect to diversity, with a different concept of what\'s valuable. It\'s not the price of land and potential golf courses, not the cheap fast forest. Thirdly, doing things like bread plates is not a rocket science - but if successful it points towards effective and regenerative entrepreneurship. Therefore, an entrepreneur doing such kind of work realizes the visions of an activist - by actually convincing a chain of restaurants to deliver local, better coffee or beer, by cutting off the middlemen. It means millions of people affected in a positive way. It takes a solid ethical concept and guts to take risks, but it pays off in many ways. And it fills the unemployment gap, which wastes the potential of a whole generation now. Interacting with the system is the way for Pavlos. And I really like the fact he\'s not used to failing.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>You can read the first part of the article here:\xa0<a href="https://edgeryders.eu/en/transforming-food-systems-in-post-crisis-greece-conversation-with">https://edgeryders.eu/en/transforming-food-systems-in-post-crisis-greece-conversation-with</a></p>', u'post_id': 704, u'user_id': 137, u'timestamp': u'2016-07-02 12:56:36', u'title': u'Greece as a hot-spot of transformative future (conversation with Pavlos Georgiadis, part 2)'}, {u'content': u'<p>Where: Portugal</p>\n\n<p>Year: 2013</p>\n\n<p>Who:<span>BITalino -</span><span> Hugo Silvia is one of the leaders</span></p>\n\n<p><span>BITalino is a low-cost modular body signal sensor kit that makes people able to learn and rapidly create wearables, quantified self apps, or biomedical devices.

I consider myself privileged to be born into a comfortable middle class life, to have a supportive family and friends, no academic problems. In theory, I was supposed to be happy. So why was I feeling so paralysed and helpless? Considering there are so many people who have it much worse than me, feeling sad seemed irrational, unjustified and shameful.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone around me seemed to manage just fine, effortlessly juggling scholastic and social expectations. So I thought it must be my fault that I was barely holding it together. I was ashamed to admit that I was struggling and ask for help. When I finally gathered enough courage to talk openly about my problems with my friends and family members, I was stunned how much it resonated. Once I had shared my troubles, many of them would admit some of their own. These were people that I had known for more than 10 years, people that I thought I knew inside out, suddenly telling me about insecurities of theirs that I never even suspected them to have. Such moments of connection were a very special experience.</p>\n\n<p>However, at times it was also exhilarating. It's not easy for either party.\xa0Opening up, even to the people I trust most,\xa0took a great deal of mental effort. Then, I didn\u2019t know how to properly express what I felt. And they didn\u2019t know how to react. I didn\u2019t know what kind of reaction I was hoping for. I didn\u2019t want to burden or worry anyone. How often did I find myself alone in my room bawling my eyes out, finally calling my mother or my best friend, just to hang up 5 minutes later even more frustrated and miserable and guilty than before. They were only trying to help me to the best of their abilities, but somehow all well-meant compliments and advice only made me feel worse. I didn\u2019t think they could truly understand me and it was so difficult to communicate what I wanted to say, when I didn't even\xa0really know what that was myself. When they tried to relate their own experiences to mine, it felt like they were comparing a broken arm to a papercut. When they were trying to give me tips on health and well-being, it felt patronizing, as if I didn\u2019t know and try that already. This was nothing that doing a round of Yoga or 8 hours of sleep or being more social could simply \u2018fix\u2019. Just thinking such things added to my guilt and shame, because it was like I was taking their attempts of help for granted. Devils circle.</p>\n\n<p>What helped me most in the end wasn\u2019t necessarily talking about anything in those situations. Discussing these things with a neutral person such as a therapist was a much better framework for me to sort out my thoughts without the added complications of emotional attachment. The greatest help for me was just someone being there and giving me a hug. Telling me that they know it sucks and just sharing a little bit of the suckiness in that moment.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>How do\xa0you deal\xa0with emotional issues? In what situations do you share\xa0your thoughts with others? How does this make you feel? What might prevent you from seeking support?\xa0</p>", u'post_id': 677, u'user_id': 3253, u'timestamp': u'2016-05-08 22:52:37', u'title': u'JUS: Sharing is scary'}, {u'content': u'<p>It was a long, very interesting talk with Pavlos.</p>\n\n<p>We started with the reason why our meeting was delayed - and that was the first narrative of care I found in this hour-long discussion.</p>\n\n<p>The\xa0reason was food, or to be more precise - Maiolica, a new restaurant in Sifnos. Georgiadis has been involved with his company "We Deliver Taste" (<a href="http://wedelivertaste.com">http://wedelivertaste.com</a>) in consulting the place, crafting the menu, making it local, affordable, Mediterranean. Their consultancy for food businesses connects small producers from all over Greece, trying to change the hospitality landscape in the country. Part of the idea is to tell people about the ingredients, the element of storytelling, which changes customers\' relations to the product, and the gastro-landscape of the country.</p>\n\n<p>Pavlos is an ethnobotanist and for 12 years he devoted his career to science, researching for his Ph.D. in Thailand and China. He left this path four years ago to invest time and energy in agrifood and environment - the brainchild of this transition is We Deliver Taste, a company that investigates the food system, from seed to stomach, in which he was joined by two Italians and a Czech. They are not only interested in the processes that bring the food to our tables, but also in the cultures surrounding it, especially the Mediterranean dining customs and love for good food. In one of the side projects, funded by Horizon 2020, they\'re also concentrating on reforming the digital aspect of the food business by\xa0preparing pilot, open data systems, tools and applications that will make the path from the farmer to the customer/industry (hospitals, hotels) more clear, while at the same time keeping people informed and educated about the content of their plate.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>By this multilayered, multifaceted enterprise Pavlos wants to change the paradigm. He believes that if the way we think about the time and space of food, meaning the time spent on preparation, growth, the human experience of food, it will have an impact on climate resilience, climate justice, biodiversity, water and soil conservation and will boost regenerative economies in rural areas.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Pavlos targets people in their 50-ties and 60-ties, those who have access to power and money, and believes that educating and informing them is crucial to driving the change. He consciously chose to become part of the market, be open for collaboration with government, and get involved with huge public procurement systems because he thinks demonizing the market is wrong. And\xa0because there is a dire need for change there. After years of scaling and working for their position, We Deliver Taste are\xa0now in serious talks with important actors.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>On a smaller scale, there is an idea of creating an edible dish which could be used in the refugee camps. It\'s not that the idea is brand new, there are some Indian startups that have crowdfunded and done it already - but it\'s that importing such a product would be counterproductive. Instead, Pavlos\xa0wants to recreate the whole system necessary for producing such a dish - an industrial designer who\'d made the moulds, a baker, ideally struggling to survive in the market, a flour producer, etc.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>He also dreams of a website that would accompany this project. One could see there how much profit it created for the parties involved, work saved on waste management and how many refugees it catered. Besides,\xa0he wants to create a crowdfunding campaign to donate money to biodegradable plastic producers in Italy, who\'d, later on, provide their product to the refugee camps in Greece. The stake is huge - 60.000 refugees, 2 meals a day, which makes a 100.000 dishes a day, and it will happen for years as maybe even a half of them\xa0will stay in Greece for longer. That would fix the existing problem of waste and even produce compost in large communal digestors to feed the organic agriculture and parks.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>"We have to enter this market fast and with confidence right now. There is not much time for discussions - it\'s somehow already too late".\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The second part of the discussion coming briefly.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 702, u'user_id': 137, u'timestamp': u'2016-07-01 12:20:54', u'title': u'Transforming food systems in post-crisis Greece (Conversation with Pavlos Georgiadis, part one)'}, {u'content': u'<h3>Where we started\xa0</h3>\n\n<p>OpenCare is a very particular research for both its topic and its modality. It wants verify the potentialities of collective intelligence and of a radical open approach to the topic of care.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Coherently with that, the definition of precise research questions (and related methodologies) has not been given a priori, but will emerge steps by step from the same research-related activities (as opposed to what happens with the standard research methodologies).</p>\n\n<p>Given that (that, by the way, is what makes OpenCare so interesting for me), I think that the positive tension towards understanding \xa0where we are and where we are gong should be continuous and should be monitored step by step. On the basis of this tension research questions should be progressively better defined considering: the general research question where we started form, the commitment with UE, the first \xa0ideas that are \xa0emerging and, last but not least, <em>a better understanding of who we are and what are the knowledge, skills and experiences we can use</em>.\xa0</p>\n\n<h3>Shared visions and languages</h3>\n\n<p>On the basis of the discussion I think, that, at least for who expressed themselves (see later, item 5), we agreed on these points:\xa0</p>\n\n<ol><li>The open care systems is an ecosystems: an environment where, in its best conditions, different care-related entities can emerge, live and thrive. These entities are very diverse in nature. They can be: care encounters, networks of care, enabling systems, different kinds of infrastructures, policies, norms, norms, ... ).\xa0</li></ol>\n\n<p>An ecosystem cannot be designed but can be enriched introducing new caring entities (with the double goal of offering more opportunities for both the caregivers and the care receivers, and for incising its systemic resilince.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The OpenCare croup and community specificity is that we deal with open care ecosystems having a particular experience and credibility on issue related to "collective intelligence and radical open approach application" (and not of care issues per se). \xa0Given that we should orient our community\'s discussion on topics that coudl be defined like that: which problems and the opportunities arise when "collective intelligence and radical open approach" are applied to and issue as "care".</p></li>\n<li><p>Discussing about openness applied to care issues, we have two main dimensions:</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>the openness in the processes thanks to which enabling systems (i.e the enabling products, services, places, infrastructures) are designed and realized</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>the openness of care-related services in use (i.e. the openness of the network of care created around the delivery of a service).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both these dimensions are important and could be considered separately. Nevertheless, it could also be very interesting to consider the interactions between the two.\xa0</p>\n\n<ol><li>Given what has been said in the point 2. and 3. an emerging research question could be: How and how much the openness of a design and production process influences the openness of service delivery. And vice versa.\xa0</li></ol>\n\n<p>Hopefully, other research questions, similar in nature to this one, will emerge.</p>\n\n<ol><li>In my view, the workshop participants who express themselves should agree with these 4 previous assumptions: can we ask them?</li></ol>\n\n<p>The problem is that, at least half of the participants did not \xa0openly expressed themselves.

After ruling out all sorts of terrible diseases and trying different treatments with no success, I went to Vienna where my condition was confirmed: Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia.\xa0The newest drug for AIHA (Rituximab) \xa0was still not approved in Romania for this rare disease, so I basically moved to Vienna where thet gave it to me, with no positive outcome, and\xa0finally I had my spleen removed and got well.</p>\n\n<p>It happened in \xa0March 2012.</p>\n\n<p>In November 2012 I was again in Vienna for artistic reasons (and the usual check-up). This is when I read for the first time about the Network of Cytostatics. Everything was familiar to me: the oldest pharmacy in Vienna, the office above Mariahilferstr, but mostly, the struggle to regain one's health....</p>\n\n<p>It was too soon for me to get involved, tha trauma was too recent.</p>\n\n<p>\xa0But in February 2013, a good friend, Simona Tache, shared on Facebook a status about needing someone going to Bucharest from Vienna.</p>\n\n<p>\xa0It clicked something inside me and I responded.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>What came next was overwhelming.</p>\n\n<p>\xa0Yes, I travelled\xa0home with medicine, calmly taking them through security and bringing them to Valeriu, the taxi driver that distributed them to the ones in need.\xa0More important was the fact that doing a simple thing, an easy gesture, meant helping someone's health and fighting a system that seemed not to care about the people. Everyone I talked to about the network felt the same: it is the least we can do!</p>\n\n<p>\xa0I truly believe people have the need to do good, to offer, to help each other.</p>\n\n<p>The Network was a way of getting people together for a good purpose. I think it is the main reason it worked so well.</p>\n\n<p>It responded the needs of others, but also our own need to give (time/ help/ encouragement).</p>\n\n<p>My own personal gain, though, was tremendous. Not only you feel good helping others, but I became very good friends with Vlad Voiculescu, the initiator if the Network, supporting each other in many other so called impossible projects or just knowing we are there at a click or phone call away.</p>\n\n<p>I got involved because I knew what it means to be helpless against a disease and I will remain involved for as long as I will live, because this Network might not be needed now for cancer drugs, but it created a gathering of great souls that will be for sure needed for many other aspects of our society that need deep and profound healing.</p>", u'post_id': 698, u'user_id': 3333, u'timestamp': u'2016-06-27 08:25:22', u'title': u'How I got involved in the Cytostatics Network'}, {u'content': u'<p>The below story is written by a third party (Me!), on behalf of a participant at the WeMake codesign session.</p>\n\n<p>In any city you can find parking lots reserved for drivers with disaplibity.\xa0 In all cities!\xa0 However, the law is different, while some countries allow you to temporarily use the lot while your engine is still on, others don\'t even let you drive inside, and in both cases, other drivers, who are not disabled, give themselves the liberty to use the available parking lot dedicated for disabled, because the found it empty.\xa0\xa0 If you have a disabiliy and you end up never finding the places that are dedicated to you whenever you are trying to park.\xa0 Wouldn\'t it be much more fair for everyone, to create a system, that react to others who carelessly took your parking?\xa0\xa0 If you are lucky enough, maye the system can alarm the police to come and take action, if not, at least, the system can alarm others that someone without a disability is now stealing a disabled person\'s place.\xa0 Possibly, the social aspect is just as important as the legal fine.\xa0\xa0\xa0 What do you think?</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Handicap_sign.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener">Header image</a> by Tgv8925, this file is licensed under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Creative_Commons" title="w:en:Creative Commons" rel="nofollow noopener">Creative Commons</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en" rel="nofollow noopener">Attribution 3.0 Unported</a> license.</p>', u'post_id': 690, u'user_id': 3069, u'timestamp': u'2016-05-31 20:46:40', u'title': u'\u201cFatti pi\xf9 in l\xe0\u201d or Step Aside'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 695, u'user_id': 3249, u'timestamp': u'2016-06-02 13:56:24', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p><em>This is a repository where we aggregate all visuals required for producing materials for projects which the Edgeryders organisation is officially backing.

As one of three kids Fabian* grew\xa0up in a endearing family, which gives\xa0him on one side as much personal and special support and on the other side treat him like his two older brothers.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Fabian\xa0lost half of his brain function after having a stroke, which lead to spastic hemiparalysis.\xa0Because of that further problems came up like a malposition of his hips and a curvature of the spine.</p>\n\n<p>When I met him he was full of power, running around, shaking everybodys hand and laughing. But most of the time he should sit in his wheelchair, in order to guard against swollen and painful knees. Because of a cognitive limitation Fabian\xa0is receiving all the stimuli. As we can focus on one thing and block our environment out, Fabian\xa0can not filter environmental information. That makes him most of the time an observer, someone who is rather watching\xa0than being in the focus of interest. Since one year his parents noticed\xa0an aggressivity against himself, because he starts to reflect on himself, his position and possibilties. A psychologyst told them that often kids with disabilities that are more supported are more reflecting themselves and know\xa0what limitations they have compared to\xa0kids that are not getting that well supported.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Getting that special and individual support is really important for them, that's why the parents decided to send Fabian\xa0to a school for physically handicapped kids.\xa0There they will have a class with about eight kids, one teacher and one pedagog. Trained assistants with different specializations\xa0like physiotherapist, care worker or ergotherapist are working in the school as well. Peter\xa0said that inclusion or integration is the actual content and sounds good,\xa0but it does not always work, as we can see in Fabians\xa0case.</p>\n\n<p>And that individuality makes it even difficult on playgrounds to build it barrierfree.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>For Fabian, who can walk and run but not grab, force or push with his one arm, playgrounds would need to have different requirements than for other handicapped kids.</p>\n\n<p>Swinging is a really nice, exciting and relaxating activity.\xa0Swings with only a plank do not fit Fabian\u2019s physical needs, since he is not able to hold himself with one arm. Laying on a birds nest swing is more easy for him.</p>\n\n<p>Slides are good to use in case the entrance is easy to reach. Climbing nets or round ladders makes it difficult for Fabian.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Water and Sand is an interesting sensorial material, that all childs love. Playing in the mud, splashing with the water, diging holes or baking sand cakes are activities that could be on hip height and done while sitting in a wheelchair.</p>\n\n<p>Getting this insight from a parents view leades us more in the direction of what kids with handicappes are able to do, what they like, what they prefer and what should have been thought from another perspective.</p>\n\n<p>*Names changed to protect privacy</p>", u'post_id': 697, u'user_id': 3257, u'timestamp': u'2016-06-17 16:49:41', u'title': u'Interview 4.0 #able'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 33741, u'user_id': 3247, u'timestamp': u'2016-06-18 06:01:34', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p><strong>Health Care is Evolving</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b76bc997f0621b6e2f0126bf54ce418b8733b4fd.jpg" width="239" height="234"></p>\n\n<div data-blogger-escaped-style="text-align: center;"><div data-blogger-escaped-style="text-align: left;">\n\n<p>For most of humanity\'s history, healthcare services were provided by communities: \xa0family members, friends and neighbours. This was considered to be a natural network of collective support. The demand for professional care health care, social care, day-care for children and elderly care seemed infinite, but the resources the economy allocates towards it clearly are not enough.</p>\n\n<p>If we try to rationalize the system and extract more out of it, it only seems to dehumanize the people in need of care. The people in need of care end up getting treated like a number in a manufacturing plant. Is there a solution that combines access to modern science and technology whilst creating a more accessible and human touch of community provided care?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Embracing a collective approach</strong></p>\n\n<p>OpenCare offers a solution with promise of bridging the gap between mainstream health care and community health care through embracing a collective approach. Recently, being granted 1.6 million euro for research to design and prototype new care services that directly effects humanity\u2019s growth, expansion and well-being.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The Opencare project started in the first quarter of 2016 and is preparing for execution. However, we hope to see results this year after the online platform has generated meaningful conversations and researchers have documented their findings. The call for participation to enter proposals in underway. \xa0The vision behind OpenCare is an alternative to the way patients and health providers interact. Health and social welfare as we know it is broken, squeezed between rising costs and impersonality, if not dehumanisation, of their provided services. OpenCare aims at deploying collective intelligence to design, prototype and evaluate care services by communities, for communities.</p>\n\n<p>The human right to health means that everyone has the right to the attainable standard of health and social care, which includes access to all medical services. Hospitals, clinics, medicines, and doctors\u2019 services must be accessible, available, acceptable, and of good quality for everyone, where and when needed. This is a logical solution to reform health care; by creating a system that is guided by universal access, availability, acceptability and quality. Whilst remaining transparent and non-discriminatory.</p>\n\n<p>This is the typical pattern of acknowledging failure and trying to be constructive and do something about it that permeates the culture of so many dwellers of the edge of societies. With the assumption that state and private institutions will be unable to meet the demands for care in the 21st century and that new, more open, participatory, community-based methods are needed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Health and social care commands change in Europe</strong></p>\n\n<p>What is health care? Who gives it? "The state is the main health care provider", say many Europeans. And sure, the welfare state is a major safety net in their societies. "Business is the main health care provider", reply many Americans. They have a point too: their insurance companies, hospitals and clinics \u2013 most of these are businesses.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, that\'s not the whole story. Health care models are failing: per capita health care expenditure is growing fast. We need to spend an ever-greater part of our resources just to stay well.\xa0Pervasive healthcare technology is one of the methods for meeting the challenges of an aging population in many countries, as well as an expected major shortage of healthcare personnel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Collective intelligence brings wisdom to health care</strong></p>\n\n<p>The topic of health and social care is human and should be handled in a humane way. We want to understand how collective intelligence can be used to solve social and health care problems.\xa0Clearly, the time has come to take a fresh look and an alternative approach to healthcare. This is not a question of injecting more technical know-how. The world is changing and we can\u2019t build walls around ourselves. We need to make space for new visions and create a fundamentally new approach to healthcare.</p>\n\n<p>The OpenCare Research Project consortium consists of a partnership with The Scimpulse Foundation, Edgeryders, the University of Bordeaux, the City of Milan, WeMake, and the Stockholm School of Economics. \xa0The consortium consists of members with different backgrounds, radical thinkers and doers, and just normal people that want to make a difference. With the support from the European Commission OpenCare is moving forward under the Horizon 2020 EU Research and Innovation programme.

Despite attempts at isolating people with disabilities, Soviet principles of equality inspired policies aiming to turn them into productive members societies as much as possible. They could thus benefit from some level of state assistance. This situation changed, as lack of funding, and general stigma against human imperfection, (ironically also inherited from the Soviets) have made it increasingly difficult for people with disabilities to reach their full potential.</p>\n\n<p>General apathy coupled with a lack of political will to tackle some of the issues related to people with disabilities, particularly, the visually impaired. This has lead to the rise of civil society organisations aiming to address these problems head-on on their own. Aside from some NGOs which have been fighting for the rights of the disabled, private sector solutions have also begun to take shape.</p>\n\n<p>Among those is the Seeing Hands massage studio. Seeing Hands came about as the result of my previous work with an NGO for the visually impaired, where I learned about all the challenges, socio-economic problems, and stigma that the beneficiaries faced. Through my work with an NGO for the visually impaired, I found that there are 6,000 blind people in Armenia, and only about 20-25 of them were permanently employed.</p>\n\n<p>Upon doing some research, i discovered a Soviet-era plan to train the visually impaired as therapeutic masseurs and built upon that Idea. Enlisting the help of my friend Liana Avetian, a trained and certified clinical masseuse, we began to train some willing pioneers. The basic concept was a massage studio that capitalises on the heightened tactile sense afforded by visually impaired citizens while creating respectable jobs by training and employing them as masseurs.</p>\n\n<p>We also received initial support from UNDP Armenia\u2019s Kolba Labs to open our Massage Studio \u201cSeeing Hands\u201d, in a new location.</p>\n\n<p>Though challenging at first, Avetian found that students were fast learners; to compensate for the loss of sight, their other senses were enhanced. \u201cThe receptors in their fingers are very much developed, their hands are like their eyes, It\u2019s perfect for them, but the biggest problem is that sometimes they\u2019re not trusting you easily - because if you don\u2019t see, you will not trust."</p>\n\n<p>\'The organisation is, on one hand, a studio that provides high-quality massages for patrons, and on the other (seeing) hand, it\'s an opportunity for a too-often marginalised demographic to get access to jobs, training, and empowerment.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing Hands also took advantage of Armenia\u2019s recent tech boom, which now employs thousands of IT professionals. This creates a new demographic of well paid middle-class people who spend their days hunched in front of a computer and often developing back pain. This allows us to train more masseurs to meet such a demand.

That model is interesting to me... however I am still struggling on how this should be implemented in internet era, to make it more friable and to make it count. I may have missed it, but it didn\'t struck me as if kennisland has taken any step in that direction. Can I ask you how did it capture your attention?</p>\n\n<p><em>Nadia: I am looking for a methodology to enable people in the broader </em><em>edgeryders</em><em> networks to contribute to the research project from wherever they are. Even if they do not have any technical skills. So I am thinking of an "Active Learner" role that could allow them to set up a similar process in their local community. And then contribute the documentation to the OpenCare online discussion</em></p>\n\n<p>Marco: \xa0OK, if that is what you have seen in her presentation (that I missed :P), than I understand why you pointed it out. Yes, learner is a fantastic role. And there are deeper parallels between education and care than meets the superficial eye. I like the thinking</p>\n\n<p><em>Nadia: How were you thinking about the prototyping process (your bits)? What deliverables do you want from participants?</em></p>\n\n<p>Marco: \xa0As documented exercises: educational role games (sort of).\xa0</p>\n\n<p><em>Nadia: Because this part as I see it would be about active learners helping us to understand the environments in which existing projects are working. As well as where there are gaps, what could be built/improved. I.e. they would be defining the specs for the prototypes.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Massimo: I see a great opportunity to join the approach scenario presented by </em><em>Marlieke</em><em> and the inclusive networking power of the Edgeryders platform, as we use it for the Opencare project. One thing that called my attention from </em><em>Marlieke\u2019s</em><em> talk is that they \u201cfind difficult to connect people\u201d and the Edgeryders platform is precisely designed for that. Now imagine if the chatter from the dynamics of Kennisland gets connected into the Opencare analytics \u2026\xa0</em></p>\n\n<p>Marco: I understand... but that is not a deliverable from laymen, is it? That would mean there is an auditor/anthropologist working with the community...</p>\n\n<p><em>Nadia: I think we can "guide" the happy amateurs. With good </em><em>instructables</em><em>/ templates. As well as through the weekly hangout meetings and 1 visit at the beginning to help them get going.</em></p>\n\n<p>Marco: I will confess that, unlike in clinical relationships, in this massive exercise, I will be learning with them <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>Nadia: Can you help me to understand what you meant by an educational role game? Or rather why you want it/ what you want to do with that input after?</p>\n\n<p>Marco: That is the easiest way I see to have a deliverable directly from the "uneducated" (so to say) volunteers. It is like documenting a flaw in a software... but doing it in society. Can we all repeat the same failure experience?</p>\n\n<p><em>Nadia: But is it aimed at showing what is broken, what could work, both or something else?\xa0Also, who is the exercise for? Who is meant to take part, who is meant to read the "results"?</em></p>\n\n<p>Marco: Mostly at what is broke - to inform the community of "solvers". Otherwise, what happens is the aristotelian debate about what has been written/said, and the solution is typically useless.</p>\n\n<p><em>Nadia: aha ok so it is meant to arrive at the same place as the </em><em>kennisland</em><em> exercise I pointed to above</em></p>\n\n<p>Marco: sort of, I really did not see it in them... they looked to me like telling anecdotes (the aristotelic exercise)</p>\n\n<p><em>Massimo: \u2026 and take advantage of the emergence of concepts and ideas to propose prototypes, to test the hypotheses. Everything the mind envisions feels\xa0different when you experiment doing a model of it and play the game. Like the children do when they build an imaginary house throwing a blanket over a couple of chairs, then they get under the blanket and play the act of living that \u201chouse\u201d, they naturally experiment further, making changes, adding improving to the initial idea, playing scenarios.</em></p>\n\n<p>Nadia: Hmm ok.\xa0So you are looking for some set up in which people share experiences and figure out the "game" they are playing. A kind of massive user-generated monopoly board game where people add the steps as they go along. \xa0What I learned from kennisland is that you do need something tangible and visible to people who are not going to engage online to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>You need a trigger: something fun which can get a conversation going in a public space...One example I reallly like is: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://creativetimereports.org/2014/04/07/does-capitalism-work-for-you/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1463733931077000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGq3BlP1yO0QxJZ4RiFqfmH4TDToA" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="http://creativetimereports.org/2014/04/07/does-capitalism-work-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://creativetimereports.org/2014/04/07/does-capitalism-work-for-you/</a></p>\n\n<p>We would need some way of recording what people say, and then doing speech to text synthesis so we have transcripts that can then be posted, discussed and made sense of on platform. Then you close the feedback loop by printing (condensed versions) of the online discussions and stories on paper. And then hanging those \xa0papers up on a clothing line or on a wall in a public place. With some way for people to reply back/ contribute to the conversation even if they are not online.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><em>Marco: Ahahaha! Ok, I was more into D&amp;D (or secondLife) than Monopoly... but that works for me as well.</em></p>\n\n<p>Massimo: Eventually the game becomes the incubator of a new initiative, organization or even an enterprise. It\u2019s easier if the initial experiments are done in a non-profit mode because then allows more freedom of thinking, less boundaries.</p>\n\n<p><em>Nadia: Do you think we could get some of the brainiacs at CERN to help us build a sign like that?</em></p>\n\n<p>Marco: I will have to arrange a brainstorming internally.

Hattest du vorher schon mal Kontakt zu China?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nein. Ich fand\u2018s gut \u2013 eigentlich. Meine Br\xfcder fanden es richtig schei\xdfe \u2013 haben geheult und hatten gar keine Lust. Ich war traurig mein Zuhause zu verlassen, aber habe es auch als M\xf6glichkeit gesehen Neues zu erkunden, neue Sachen, neue Sprache, Kultur und so. Was kann ich noch sagen? Es gibt so vieles. Es war auf jeden Fall schwierig sich dort einzufinden, weil der Alltag und die Einstellung sehr anders waren als in Deutschland. Also insgesamt, wie die Leute gelebt haben. Kultur bedeutet ja nicht nur Tanz und Musik, das schl\xe4gt sich ja \xfcberall nieder: wie die H\xe4user aussehen, wie das U-Bahnnetz aufgebaut ist, wie sich Leute begr\xfc\xdfen\u2026</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hat man gemerkt, dass das Alter einen Unterschied macht? Deins und das Alter von deinem Vater, also wie man verschieden den Alltag wahrnimmt und sich integriert als Erwachsener und als Kind?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Der gr\xf6\xdfte Unterschied bestand bei mir und meiner Mutter. Mein Vater hatte ja dort schon Kollegen/Freunde\u2026sein Alltag war nicht so anders. Meiner Mutter fiel es schwer Kontakte zu kn\xfcpfen. Wir Kinder sind ja \xfcber die Schule eingebunden worden. Aber die Erwachsenen mussten sich selbst zurecht finden. Es gab auch Support -Organisationen, aber das waren dann kurze Willkommens-Veranstaltungen und dann ging es nicht weiter. Zudem ist es f\xfcr \xe4ltere Menschen umso schwerer die Sprache zu lernen. Als Kind geht das noch leichter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ich wei\xdf nicht, ob das jetzt zu pers\xf6nlich ist\u2026aber was hat deine Mutter dort gemacht? Dein Vater hatte den Job und ihr Kinder die Schule, aber wie war das f\xfcr deine Mutter?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sie hatte keine Arbeit\u2026.jetzt speziell. Aber \xfcber die Jahre hat sie sich selbst integriert in die Gesellschaft der Eltern, Nachbarschaft und Schule\u2026sie war z.B. im Elternbeirat. Und sie hat dann viele gemeinn\xfctzige Projekte angefangen selber zu organisieren, selbst angefangen Willkommens-Treffen f\xfcr neue Leute an der Schule zu organisieren, Wochenendausfl\xfcge f\xfcr Eltern und Kinder und eine Fu\xdfball-Liga. Au\xdferdem hat sie B\xfccher geschrieben, so Guide-Books, die die wichtigsten Dinge erl\xe4utern: \xc4rzte, die Englisch sprechen; wo man Schuhe findet, die gro\xdf genug sind, weil die Asiaten ziemlich kleine F\xfc\xdfe haben, 38 findet man noch, aber mit 42 hat man kaum eine Chance, da muss man die Insider-Tipps kennen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Warst du auf einer normalen Schule?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Wir waren auf einer internationalen Schule, als experts und sehr abgeschirmt von den locals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Was war das f\xfcr eine Erfahrung? Gut oder schlecht?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Beides! Ich fand es immer schon einen krassen Unterschied zwischen der chinesischen Kultur und meiner eigenen. Irgendwie ist es schon auch schade, dass man nicht so viel interagiert hat mit Chinesen. Aber durch die Schule habe ich auch die Option bekommen ganz viele verschiedene Kulturen kennenzulernen, auch die chinesische. Man ist viel rumgereist und hat auch schon einiges angenommen. Man hat sich aber schon \xa0auch als Fremder gef\xfchlt und wurde auch als Fremder angesehen. Ich wei\xdf nicht ob das deine Frage so beantwortet\u2026</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hast du denn dann China generell als Land empfunden, das offen f\xfcr sowas ist? Oder eher als ein nicht so offenes Land f\xfcr Fremde?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mein Eindruck ist nochmal ein ganz anderer, als der meiner Mutter. Sie hat viel mit chinesischen Organisationen gearbeitet durch ihre Projekte. Ich hatte nie das Gef\xfchl, das wir feindselig angeschaut wurden, aber es gab auch nicht nur Offenheit. China hat geschichtlich gesehen nicht nur die besten Erfahrungen mit Ausl\xe4ndern gemacht: Im 20 Jahrhundert wurden sie von verschiedensten Kolonialm\xe4chten ausgebeutet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wie war es f\xfcr dich dann nach Deutschland zur\xfcck zu kommen?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ich bin ja gar nicht direkt zur\xfcck, sondern erstmal nach England. Aber es war eigentlich, als w\xe4re ich nie weg gewesen, weil wir auch immer in den Ferien in Deutschland waren. Deutschland ist irgendwie immer mein Zuhause gewesen.</p>\n\n<p><em>Reflection - Care on the move\xa0</em></p>\n\n<p>Gesundheit war ein Thema, bei dem der kulturelle Unterschied besonders offensichtlich wurde. Die Auffassung von Wohlbefinden hat sehr spirituelle und traditionelle Z\xfcge in der chinesischen Medizin. Man h\xf6rt von riesigen Schwarzmarktgesch\xe4ften, die Haifischflossen und Teile anderer gef\xe4hrdeter Tierarten f\xfcr medizinische Zwecke anbieten. Auch andere \u201aalternative\u2018 Heilpraktiken wie Akupunktur, Massagen, Pflanzenheilkunde und bestimmte Bewegungsformen wie Qigong sind sehr beliebt. Es ist ein ganzheitliches Konzept von Gesundheit verbreitet; alles h\xe4ngt miteinander zusammen, Balance ist ma\xdfgebend. Die meisten Leute folgen Prinzipien der traditionellen Chinesischen Medizin, obwohl diese nicht auf wissenschaftlichen Fakten beruht und oft ineffektiv oder gar sch\xe4dlich sein kann. Was hier manchmal als Aberglaube oder Hippiequatsch abgestempelt wird, wird dort weitgehend praktiziert. Weiter noch wird eher der westlichen Medizin und industriellen Pharmazie misstraut.</p>\n\n<p>Als Ausl\xe4nder in China war es nicht immer einfach, die richtige Pflege zu bekommen. Kommunikation war die erste H\xfcrde. Das Gesundheitssystem war ganz anders aufgebaut. Zudem musste man sich neu orientieren: man konnte nicht mehr einfach zu seinem altbekannten Hausarzt gehen, sondern musste erst mal neue Anlaufstellen finden. Es gab gewisse Kliniken und Zahn\xe4rzte, die unter den Expats verbreitet waren, wo die meisten hingingen, weil dort Englisch gesprochen wurde oder man gar international \xc4rzte hatte. Doch gr\xf6\xdfere Operationen lie\xdf man dann doch lieber in Deutschland machen oder holte sich zumindest eine zweite Meinung in Hongkong ein, dass durch seine britische Besetzung einen sehr starken westlichen Einfluss aufwies. Wieso diese Art Missvertrauen zu den chinesischen \xc4rzten bestand, wei\xdf ich nicht. Lag es nur an der Angst, sich nicht richtig verst\xe4ndigen zu k\xf6nnen oder gab es generell kulturelle Unterschiede im Umgang mit Krankheit? Wie unterschiedlich war der Stand der Technik?</p>\n\n<p>Was ich wei\xdf ist, dass meine Mutter bestimmte Medikamente zum Beispiel nur in Deutschland kaufen konnte \u2013 auf der anderen Seite waren in China Pillen ohne Rezept zu erstehen, die in Deutschland gar nicht verkauft werden durften. Die Regulationen und Kontrollen waren generell anders. Zudem hat man erfahren, dass Chinesen aus H\xf6flichkeit nicht gerne \u201anein\u2018 sagen, auch wenn sie wissen, dass sie etwas nicht k\xf6nnen.

Mental health is not easy to approach, and not once have I heard lately how sharing a deeply personal story in public feels scary.

Her approach to mental care which I liked a lot is a community rewiring of listening and offering support, <em>"that everyone who lives in a distributed area is in someway involved in processing the emotions experienced in that place".</em> I\u2019m hoping her piece will explore connection to inhabited spaces, using the digital as a space for honesty - more details to come.</p>\n\n<p><em>Real-life conversations from real experience in which neither party is an expert can be life changing. I work a lot with VR and seeing through another\'s eyes is certainly helpful but what really leads to change is honestly communicating difficult experience and listening to others and accepting their experience. There\'s some sort of validation in the honesty of that process that allows for shifts. There are lots of CBT, brain training, "look at things brighter" apps around but perhaps there\'s room for bold digital networks - with some serious legal tick boxes in place - that make possible structured honest relational experiences between people in a particular place</em>. - Kate in her <a href="/t/notes-from-community-call-on-emotional-health-and-possibly-inappropropriate-conversation/5625/4">thoughtful contribution</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.

Is it possible to "jump a generation" in the organization of health care provision in developping countries? This is the underlying question of the "modern" collaborative care expriences we are going to share in this post about Coeur d\'Or.</p>\n\n<p>As a short backgrund, Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) induce yearly about 17 millions of deaths. Over 75% of those deaths occur in LMICs where risk factors are highly prevalent and the health system is poorly adapted to deal with chronicle and highly expensive emergent conditions. In Benin, the prevalence of high blood pressure is about 30%. Health promotion on this poorly funded issue, in this limited resource setting, requires innovative communication tools. To this end, <em>C\u0153ur d\u2019Or</em> <em>(</em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/coeurdor/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.facebook.com/groups/coeurdor/</a> ) was created in 2011, to test the feasibility of using social media for providing promotional and preventive care against CVD in Benin, in a collaborative way.</p>\n\n<p><b>We aim\xa0here t</b>o present briefly\xa0<em>C\u0153ur d\u2019Or </em>, and some lessons learned so far. We use a case study approach based on participatory observation, (in) formal in-depth interviews with different stakeholders and documents reviews on the solution. \xa0Social media analytics tools are used for the quantitative analysis of the profiles of the solution users and activity.</p>\n\n<p><em>C\u0153ur d\u2019Or</em> is an open Facebook group of 21615 members, mainly from Benin (West Africa). It runs as a tool of keeping in touch with a huge number of the community members, allowing for a double-sense communication, spreading cutting-edge information on CVDs and building a community-based leadership on CVD. The targets are young, mainly from urban and semi-urban areas, educated and active on social media. They connect to the platform using mainly smartphones.\xa0 A wide range of subjects related to CVDs and Non-Communicable Diseases are discussed from several perspectives. Members can initiate a discussion stream, receive inputs from several profiles of members and get a summary from a medical expert based on key evidence-based prevention measures against CVD.</p>\n\n<p>The group stands also as a social mobilization and community participation tools influencing the agenda setting at the national level. It is currently a member of the Multisectorial National Committee against NCDs in Benin, as a leading actor supporting the organization of national campaigns against CVD in Benin each year since 2011.\xa0 Using its online critical mass and its growing network in traditional media and several public and private institutions, the group is capable of mobilizing each year since 2013 material and financial resources up to 25,000 \u20ac to organize offline activities such as a walk (about 5000 participants each year), risk factors screening, interactive conferences during the world heart day. All those activities help at reaching people that are not active online and are done with the leadership of members that are not health workers.</p>\n\n<p>The rapid development of telecommunications improves the access of a growing number of people to Internet and social media. A critical mass of the group improves its political influence and creates a web tool that can help for a viral diffusion.</p>\n\n<p><em>C\u0153ur d\u2019Or</em> demonstrates the feasibility of using social media as an innovative approach for offering promotional and preventive care on health issues in sub-Saharan Africa. It opens new windows for thinking and dreaming again for an effective community participation in all its dimensions in the global south.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much for your comments and questions.</p>', u'post_id': 672, u'user_id': 3273, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-25 16:51:07', u'title': u'"Coeur d\'Or": collaborative efforts for promotional and preventive cardiovascular care in West-Africa'}, {u'content': u'<p>War is like a dirty toilet that no one wants to clean someone said...</p>\n\n<p>Violence begets violence and war is the\xa0ugliest\xa0human invention.

How my father was captured by the Navy. The "re-education camp". The second try... the good people at the boarding home they were allowed to stay at. Fellow refugee children they made friends with.

We have found it so inspiring, it was exactly what we were talking about.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment we are trying not to have any idea of how our product will look like so that we can have a neutral research and hopefully a surprising result, but we are looking in the direction of a design intervention that will encourage people to be vulnerable and share their feelings with their loved ones.</p>\n\n<p>Both Pauline and I went through therapy and we both agree that what was missing in our lives was the ability to share our difficulties with our close ones. We discovered that both of us had to use objects in order to speak to our therapists. I had to put a cushion over my knees and Pauline was always keeping her hands busy by playing with hair bands or ripping pieces of paper, avoiding eye contact.</p>\n\n<p>We were wondering whether you might have made any similar interesting experiences/observations to share with. Do you feel comfortable sharing your feeling with others? Can you get people to open up to you?</p>\n\n<p>We are trying to gain insight on what kinds of stressors people find difficult to talk about and how we might make it easier for people to overcome shame and share their feelings, drawing inspiration from any culture, any time.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you have any other Ideas, thoughts, articles, projects, products or whatever you think can inspire us further please let us know.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you so much for reading so far,</p>\n\n<p>Team JUS.</p>\n\n<p>P.s. - We really liked <a href="https://vimeo.com/81492863" rel="nofollow noopener">this short video</a> and wish we could make a sofa that feels as good as the hug in the picture above.</p>', u'post_id': 678, u'user_id': 3271, u'timestamp': u'2016-05-10 08:52:48', u'title': u'JUS: Design for vulnerability'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 504, u'user_id': 3250, u'timestamp': u'2016-05-09 21:09:48', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p>This is mostly for <a class="mention" href="/u/melancon">@melancon</a>, but in the spirit of working out loud...</p>\n\n<p>OpenCare will produce some software to look at online conversations.

Especially when a Public Administration try to engage citizens asking them to contribute to a project, it faces the problem to incentivize them with concrete benefits in exchange for their time, effort or behavioural change, signing a sort of implicit \u201cpact\u201d. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>Particular attention should be paid to this aspect, in order to avoid misunderstandings and unfulfilled expectations.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>OpenCare engages citizens on care-specific challenges and envisages implementing concrete solutions to be co-designed by citizens themselves and prototyped by wemake.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>3 | Inclusiveness </span></p>\n\n<p><span>Different approaches are needed to outreach and engage a wider public, including migrants, the elderly, disabled people and other social groups. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>To engage effectively with citizens, one needs to ensure that the process is genuinely open to heterogeneous groups, not only the digitally confident. This must be organically embedded from the beginning. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>4 | Push approach, not pull </span></p>\n\n<p><span>To involve people, and in particular specific demographic groups, we need to go where those people are, instead of assuming they will come to us. Instead of a pull approach where for instance a traditional consultation assumes that the people will go the place assigned to be (either physically or virtually) to engage citizens, OpenCare needs to go where the people are really. These are maybe unusual locations for public administration to go.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>5 | Online-Offline balanced interventions </span></p>\n\n<p><span>Online apps and platforms can be useful to engage citizens and collect input. Face-to-face and group interaction is likewise valuable for driving discussion and co-creating solutions, particularly with non-digitally savvy groups. Online and offline approaches also come with different expectations that must be considered. There are many examples of both used for diverse ends. The nature of the online and offline interaction is very different. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>Online information enables the quick sharing of an important amount of content and enables swift short reactions, while offline approaches are necessary to reach less digitally savvy groups such as the elderly or less educated citizens that might not be otherwise included. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>Offline engagement also allows face-to-face discussions, sharing of feelings and perception, the building of trust, impressions, making a sense of community, sympathy and empathy, as well as co-creation and solution building.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Particular attention should be paid to understand benefits and limits of different settings.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Timeline:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<span>March, 12th 2016</span><span>, \xa0Milano - Arci Olmi: </span><br>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>Opencare meets an older age group used to dance old-fashioned style (in collaboration with Mare Culturale Urbano)</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<span>March, 17th 2016</span><span>, Milano - Villa Pallavicini: </span><br>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>Opencare meets a group of Migrants </span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<span>March, 30th 2016</span><span>, Milano - WeMake: </span><br>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>Opencare meets a group of Parents of disabled children (joined to x Vivaio Association)</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<span>April, 19th 2016</span><span>, Milano - Spazio \u201cWelfare di tutti\u201d: </span><br>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>Opencare meets the members of S.

The reason being that we both are part of a movement to make health- and social care accessible, open source, privacy-friendly and participatory.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that, when faced with care challenges, communities rise to meet them. By doing so, they step outside of our current paradigm, one of provision of care services by a combination of the state and private business. This changes the game completely to one of decentralization and reciprocity.</p>\n\n<p>Initiatives such as\xa0Diy Orthodontics\xa0and\xa0Diabetes Pumps\xa0are just the tip of the iceberg. In Benin, Jean Paul Doussou has run an impressive grassroots initiative to improve cardiac health using a Facebook group and Edgeryders-like community management techniques. In Greece communities are going so far as to run a\xa0shadow zero-cash health care system. In Dorotea, a small village in mid-northern Sweden, citizens have squatted the hospital facilities and started running health services for locals on a voluntary basis . Everywhere we look we are seeing a lot of radical experimentation. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>Which raises some questions\u2026\xa0</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li><i>How do these initiatives manage to navigate the legal, administrative, and cultural obstacles to their widespread adoption?</i></li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li><i>How do we ensure that the devices which keep us healthy are safe and that there is an acceptable social contract for the code that runs in our bodies?</i></li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li><i>Do we even know\xa0what we mean when we talk about care?</i></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>These services and solutions often display an uncanny degree of efficiency. But they cannot easily be added to our existing care system. They are too strange: ad hoc, blurry at the edges, often existing in legal gray areas. Also many of them are small, very specific services run on volunteer basis. This has its challenges. One of which is providing continuity and coherence\xa0over a long periods of time as we learned from our delve into\xa0Stewardship.</p>\n\n<h3>Let\u2019s take the example of Dementia.</h3>\n\n<p>The goal in Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatment is rehabilitation. This requires a lot of patience- figuring out what can the person can\u2019t do anymore, and identifying the right kind of tool to support them. If they have had a stroke and are weak on one side this may mean a cane, or a walker.\xa0But equally important, you also figure out what can the person still do, about 98 % of people \u201cwant to live at home with dementia, so the goal here is to maximize the person\u2019s functioning independence and embed them in an environment that supports them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Right now Edgeryders is pioneering\xa0a new initiative in which we\xa0design\xa0and test\xa0a community-driven model for social and health care</strong>. We are doing this together with a number of partners which include the City of Milan (they\'ve been looking in this direction for some time now).</p>\n\n<p><strong>We start by finding and understanding some of the\xa0care services that communities are providing - right now</strong> to people that the state and private business have let down. We then ask how we, as societies, would need to change for them to continue to exist, and to scale where possible. We are\xa0discussing, among other things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The economic truism that "health care costs can only go up, never down", and why that\'s a fallacy.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The difficult relationship between care giving and management culture.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Greece\'s shadow health care service. 68 clinics with no legal status, don\'t accept money and provide free health care to people out the public health care system.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>A makerspace in England with a diverse user base, where people find meaning (and income) through engaging with open technologies.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>a decentralized 9-1-1 alternative built for and by people who are not well served by existing emergency response services.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>How we (you and me and everyone we know)\xa0can help tackle some of the messy challenges involved\xa0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>We cannot, and should not, do this alone. <strong>Edgeryders mission is to complement, no compete with,\xa0existing initiatives and people doing important work.</strong>\xa0So we are\xa0supporting busy people active in community care space to join this common conversation. <strong>We fund people running existing projects\xa0to monitor themselves and share their knowledge and learn from each other.</strong> If Helliniko had assesment that health economist could read they could have reached goal of influencing how public health system works. Their experience would be more legible and helpful to others who wish to set up similar initiatives elsewhere. Possibly even influence policymakers to change disfunctional elements in health- and social care systems: in Greece and beyond.</p>\n\n<p><span><strong>Want to get involved?</strong> Check out the Op3n Fellowship Program at\xa0<a href="http://bit.ly/1SqgtX2"></a><a href="http://bit.ly/1SqgtX2">http://bit.ly/1SqgtX2</a>. </span></p>\n\n<p><span><em><strong>Don\'t hesitate to ask questions or for help with developing your contribution</strong>\xa0- it\'s what we are here for.\xa0\xa0You can tweet <a href="http://twitter.com/edgeryders"><span class="mention">@edgeryders</span></a> or write to\xa0<a>community@edgeryders.eu</a>\xa0 \xa0(please use hashtag #op3ncare so we know what it\'s about).</em></span></p>\n\n<p>More info about the research project\xa0<a href="/t/welcome-to-opencare/4858"></a><a href="http://bit.ly/26JAEZv">http://bit.ly/26JAEZv</a></p>', u'post_id': 5618, u'user_id': 8, u'timestamp': u'2016-05-02 06:29:32', u'title': u'How can we provide health- and social care where the state and private sector are failing?'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 499, u'user_id': 3275, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-29 07:20:15', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p>1) Are you\xa0navigating deep changes in your community and want to make sense of them?</p>\n\n<p>2) Interested in\xa0communities-provided care services (social, health, technology based)?</p>\n\n<p>3) Want to connect with peers and chat about actual solutions?</p>\n\n<p>OpenCare is a project run in collaboration with cities,\xa0maker spaces, research institutes, academia, communities on the ground in Europe, and especially<span> </span>individuals, which means each and every one of us.\xa0Starting now and throughout\xa0the next year we are building a community of\xa0Fellows with\xa0genuine interest in care and\xa0availability to share\xa0their\xa0experience and projects in different corners of the world.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ll dedicate Monday\'s online meetup\xa0to explain, ask and learn more about the <a href="/t/the-opencare-community-fellowship-program/5296">Op3nCare Fellowship</a> program awarding writing\xa0and research awards of up to 20 000 euros during the next year.</p>\n\n<p>As usual, the time for our call is\xa0Monday at 4:30 PM CET here:\xa0<a href="https://meet.jit.si/opencare">https://meet.jit.si/opencare</a> (courtesy of edgeryder\xa0<a href="/u/eirinimal">Eirinimal</a>!)\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Date: 2016-05-09 17:30:00 - 2016-05-09 18:30:00, Europe/Amsterdam Time.</p>', u'post_id': 5599, u'user_id': 3, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-27 05:10:12', u'title': u'All you need to know about OpenCare Fellowships: community call 9/5 at 4:30 PM CET'}, {u'content': u'<p>The team: High resolution Photos + Updated 1 paragraph bios in profile.</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/b1ee359d007846853299c6f13706e9e21e286f32" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b1ee359d007846853299c6f13706e9e21e286f32.jpg" class="lightbox" title="collage.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b1ee359d007846853299c6f13706e9e21e286f32_1_690x234.jpg" width="690" height="234"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">collage.jpg</span><span class="informations">1200x408 359 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>Noemi Salantiu: </strong>community manager since 2012\xa0with skills in online coordination\xa0and helping people find their way.

Eher habe ich mich mit Hacking Utopia besch\xe4ftigt. Also was w\xe4re ein Utopia und wie k\xf6nnte man das Hacken? Also wie k\xf6nnte man Utopien entwickeln.</p>\n\n<p>Pflege ist f\xfcr jemanden da zu sein. Wohlwollend f\xfcr jemanden da zu sein, wohlwollend auf jemanden einzuwirken. Ein sehr pers\xf6nliches Bsp. W\xe4re von meinen Gro\xdfeltern. Mein Opa ist an Alzheimer erkrankt. Das hat sich \xfcber drei oder vier Jahre hingezogen. Meine Mutter wollte es so stemmen, dass sie zuhause bleiben und nicht ins Altersheim kommt. Und Pflegebed\xfcrftig bedeutet Macht abzugeben. Und pflege hei\xdft in diesem Fall abrufbar zu sein und so zu priorisieren, dass sich alles um die eine Person dreht.</p>\n\n<p>Manchmal bedeutet, dass Oma Nachts mit Taschenlampe einzusammeln. Oder Situationen im Haushalt, wo sie den Herd einfach angelassen hat und etwas Feuer f\xe4ngt.</p>\n\n<p>Ich wei\xdf nicht, ob ich das gut einsch\xe4tzen kann, inwiefern es mein Leben beeinflusst hat. Ich war ja relativ jung, als es mein Leben beeinflusst hat. Wir sind bei den Gro\xdfeltern eingezogen. Meine Mutter fand das gut, dass ich auf dem Land aufwachsen konnte und ich als Kind versorgt wurde. Und dann sind die Gro\xdfeltern \xe4lter geworden. Mein Opa ist gestorben und meine Oma demenzkrank geworden.</p>\n\n<p>Der Pflegebegriff, den ich mit dem Alter verbinde ist nochmal ein anderer als der von Kindern. Aber beide Arten von Pflege \u2013 also Pflege generell ist mit Liebe verbunden. Meine Mutter hat mich geliebt, genauso wie sie ihre Eltern geliebt hat. Diese Liebe gibt einem auch Kraft und die braucht man auch. Sonst ist das ja schwer zu stemmen. In unserem System wird das Verh\xe4ltnis dann durch Geld kompensiert. Aber da sieht man ja auch, dass es M\xe4ngel gibt. Da sieht man z.B., dass Pfleger die Zeit sehr eng sehen \u2013 sie sind f\xfcr 10 min. da und nicht l\xe4nger. Und dieses schnell-schnell homediensten oder Karitas, das sehe ich auch bei uns im Dorf. Da sind mal \xe4ltere Leute und da kommt ein Auto vorbeigehuscht und das steht dann mal da f\xfcr 10 min. und ist dann wieder weg. Da stehen gr\xf6\xdfere Unternehmen dahinter, da geht es um Jobs, da geht es um Geld. Die haben ihren durchgetakteten Plan.</p>\n\n<p>Der Begriff \u201ePflege\u201c ist der gleiche nur der Inhalt ist anders. Der Glaube \u2013 also nicht im religi\xf6sen Sinne \u2013 der Glaube daran, dass die Person es doch noch alles mitbekommt, was um sie passiert ist auch wichtig. Man denkt ja, dass solche Personen gar nichts mehr mitbekommen. Und da hatten wir auch Gl\xfcck. Wir haben eine Pflegerin \xfcber das Internet gefunden, die meine Oma schon im fr\xfchen Stadium kennengelernt hatte. Und ich habe gemerkt, dass sie sich gut verstehen, als sie meine Oma zum Lachen gebracht hatte. Das darf man auch nicht untersch\xe4tzen. Meine Oma hatte auch sehr helle Tage. Aber das war alles sehr abrupt. Pl\xf6tzlich hat sie nicht mehr reagiert. Und ich w\xfcrde es daran messen, dass die Pflegerin mit meiner Oma wirklich Scherze machen konnte.</p>\n\n<p>Als ich meine Oma in der Situation im Schnee reinholen musste, als sie dachte, dass sie Milch holen wollte. Und ich will nicht l\xfcgen, es war f\xfcr mich als kleiner Junge auch wie ein Abenteuer da im Schneegest\xf6ber rauszugehen. Und ein bisschen Angst hatte ich auch. Als ich die gefunden hatte, war ich sehr w\xfctend \u2013 einfach nur w\xfctend. Aber dann habe ich verstanden, dass sie einfach in einer andere Art Zeitzone war manchmal. Sie sprach von ganz anderen Dingen.</p>\n\n<p>Sehr konkret hing das Alzheimer mit dem Tod meines Gro\xdfvaters zusammen. Fr\xfcher gab es sehr strikte Rollenverteilungen. Als mein Gro\xdfvater verstarb ist ihre elementare St\xfctze weggebrochen. Und sie konnte es nicht mehr verarbeiten. Sie hatte auch eine Art Schlaganfall, bei dem sie auch \xf6fter meinen Namen gerufen hat. Sie war da auch l\xe4nger im Krankenhaus. Danach hat sie immer mehr abgebaut.</p>\n\n<p>Die ganze Zeit \xfcber drei Jahre hatte lustige Situationen, sch\xf6ne Situationen aber auch ganz klar traurige Situationen. Lustig war bspw., dass Haushaltsgegenst\xe4nde versteckt wurden und dann an Orten aufgetaucht sind an denen man es nicht erwartet h\xe4tte. Meine Mutter besa\xdf Kaschmirpullower, die meine Oma in die Kochw\xe4sche geschmissen hatte. Meine Mutter war sehr ruhig in solchen Situationen</p>\n\n<p>B\xfcgeleisen angelassen, Kabel verschmolzen. Da muss man eben schnell reagieren. Und auch Verwechslungen, bei denen meine Oma Menschen verwechselt hat.</p>\n\n<p>Meine Mutter ist Grundschullehrerin. Sie hat versucht mich relativ aus diesen Umsorgungen herauszulassen. Aber wenn sie auf Elternabenden war, musste ich mich bspw. um Oma k\xfcmmern. Im fr\xfchen Stadium konnte man noch Brettspiele mit ihr spielen. Sowohl die Pflegering als auch der jetztige Mann (damals Freund) meiner Mutter haben sich sehr aufopfernd mitgek\xfcmmert.</p>\n\n<p>Wenn wir uns der Aufgabe nicht angenommen h\xe4tten, dann w\xe4re es f\xfcr meine Mutter eine schlimme Last gewesen, dass sie es nicht gewollt oder gekonnt h\xe4tte. Meine Oma im Altersheim zu lassen w\xe4re sehr schwierig gewesen f\xfcr meine Mutter \u2013 mit der Gewissheit zu leben, dass sie nicht da war.</p>\n\n<p>F\xfcr meine Mutter war die Situation nat\xfcrlich schwierig. Es gab gro\xdfe Einschr\xe4nkungen im Alltagsleben.</p>\n\n</div><div>\n\n<p><strong>Honey befragt Leoni:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Wie glaubst du k\xf6nnte man Pflege in unserer Heutigen Welt angehen?</p>\n\n<p>In der n\xe4heren Umgebung?</p>\n\n<p>Ich muss niemanden pflegen.</p>\n\n<p>Es ist pflege sich mit Freundin zu unterhalten.</p>\n\n<p>Bei dir selbst?</p>\n\n<p>Sich bewegen, den K\xf6rper Pflegen. Die Psyche Pflegen.</p>\n\n<p>Warum musst du dich Pflegen.</p>\n\n<p>Damit ich gesund bleibe.</p>\n\n<p>Ist es ein Problem das Menschen dieses Bed\xfcrfnis nicht haben?</p>\n\n<p>Unterschiedlich. Solange du keine Probleme hast musst du dich nicht darum k\xfcmmern.</p>\n\n<p>Es kann passieren, dass du MS hast.</p>\n\n<p>Ich wie? nicht ob eine Leib, Seele Trennung Sinn macht. Man kann im Gehirn zeigen, das psychische Probleme sich K\xf6rperlich H\xe4usern. Wir haben sie nur noch nicht verstanden. Man kann K\xf6rper und Geist nicht trennen.</p>\n\n<p>K\xf6rperkult?</p>\n\n<p>Sport und Bewegung ist Pflege, aber man muss unterscheiden. Dreimal die Woche rennen gehen kann nicht gesund sein. F\xfcr manche Menschen eventuell schon. Es geht um die reine Bewegung F\xfcr die Durchblutung, den Sauerstoffgehalt, die Haut, die Sonne bekommt. F\xfcr den ganzen K\xf6rper.</p>\n\n<p>Bewegungsunf\xe4higkeit.</p>\n\n<p>Ich hatte eine Bekannte die im Rollstuhl sa\xdf. Sie musste alle zwei Stunden nach Hause an eine Ladestation. Eigentlich k\xf6nnte sie Laufen, doch sie hat Spastiken und traut sich nicht ohne den Rollstuhl zu laufen. Sehr motivierend finde ich die L\xe4ufer der Paralympics.</p>\n\n<p>Stellst du deine Pflege vor die Pflege anderer?</p>\n\n<p>Das steht in einem Jing-Jang Verh\xe4ltnis. Wenn im Flugzeug der Druck f\xe4llt, wird dir auch gesagt, dass du zuerst selbst die Maske anziehen sollt und dann anderen.</p>\n\n<p>Nur in wenigen Situationen wiederspricht mein Pflegebed\xfcrfnis dem der anderen. Das Problem ist wenn Leute nicht genug bekommen.</p>\n\n<p>Wir helfen der Menschheit damit?</p>\n\n<p>Nein, das Mittlere Management, macht nichts anderes als andere Leute zu beobachten. Ich denke die Meisten Menschen wollen etwas Sinnvolle tun.</p>\n\n<p>Wie ver\xe4ndert das das Verh\xe4ltnis zu anderen, Familie.</p>\n\n<p>Es ist ein Wechselspiel. In einer Gro\xdffamilie ist es egal ob zu einem Pflegebed\xfcrftigen Kind noch ein alter daf\xfcr kommt. Menschen sind eher daf\xfcr gemacht in Rudeln zu leben. Es muss ja nicht Zwangsl\xe4ufig die Familie sein sondern eine Gruppe Menschen, der man sich anschlie\xdft.</p>\n\n<p>Pflege ist ein Verh\xe4ltnis. Menschen machen nichts, was sie unertr\xe4glich finden. Auch bei kleinen Kindern. Wenn du dir das Objektive Betrachtest ist es sehr hart. Rund um die Uhr Betreuung, Nachts Ausstehen. Pflege ist nie Einseitig.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Philipp befragt Honey:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Habe noch nie mitbekommen dass es transdisziplin\xe4re Zusammenarbeit gibt</p>\n\n<p>Thema war sekund\xe4r</p>\n\n<p>Jede Interaktion mit der Umwelt ist Pflege</p>\n\n<p>Pflege beruht auf Erfahrung und die haben wir in uns, man kann den Umgang mit der Umwelt antrainieren, wenn ich mit der Weise wie ich mit der Welt umgehe zufrieden bin, dann ist es auch wie eine Pflege f\xfcr mich selbst</p>\n\n<p>Insgesamt ist das kapitalistische System in uns ein Chaos ausgel\xf6st</p>\n\n<p>Wir stehen als Generation st\xe4ndig im Mittelpunkt</p>\n\n<p>Gesellschaft wertet st\xe4ndig und Geld bewertet Dinge</p>\n\n<p>Man kann keine Verantwortung f\xfcr 300 Leute \xfcbernehmen und man sucht sich schon genau aus zu wem man seine Verbindung aufbaut</p>\n\n<p>Ich rede mit mir selbst \xfcber Zeitmanagement obwohl das eigentlich nat\xfcrlich sein sollte</p>\n\n<p>Die Intuition wird immer schw\xe4cher, man muss immer eine Grundlage von Pro und Contra f\xfcr alle seine Entscheidungen haben</p>\n\n<p>Wirtschaft beeinflusst die Politik sodass die die Leute beeinflussen schneller in den Hamsterk\xe4fig zu gelangen. In unseren Studieng\xe4ngen entwickelt man dazu schnell ein Bewusstsein und versucht dagegen anzugehen.</p>\n\n<p>Tendenz zur Meconomy immer mehr Freiberufler weil die Leute realisieren dass sich die Aufgabe f\xfcr Menschen die sich nicht um mich k\xfcmmern? Das gleiche gilt auch f\xfcr die Pflege, man w\xfcrde ja nicht irgendwelche Leute pflegen die einen permanent fertig machen, es sei denn da ist wieder Geld als Kompensation</p>\n\n<p>Ich besch\xe4ftige mich sehr stark damit ob man auch ein gesundes Unternehmens-Mitarbeiter-Verh\xe4ltnis hat, der Mensch kann nicht mehr als 150 Leute in seinem Umkreis verstehen.</p>\n\n<p>Deswegen besch\xe4ftige ich mich auch viel mit Holokratie, wo sich alle in kleineren Holons verbinden. Sogar die Gr\xfcnder arbeiten in Holons.</p>\n\n<p>Aber die Tendenz ist dass es wenige gro\xdfe Konzerne gibt, die alle Konkurrenz schlucken. Damit liegt die Entscheidungskraft bei wenigen Leuten die sehr komplexe Entscheidungen treffen.</p>\n\n<p>Das funktioniert vielleicht bei Lebensmitteln die immer gebraucht werden wo sich dann wenige Konzerne die Macht teilen</p>\n\n<p>Die gro\xdfen Konzerne haben keine Empathie mehr und daher werden sie sehr skrupellos.</p>\n\n<p>DU muss st\xe4ndig vernetzt sein und die Au\xdfenwelt fordert das auch die ganze ZEit von dir</p>\n\n<p>Es gibt so eine Sperrrate, ab 750.000 oder mehr kriegst du das nicht mehr mit, Geld ist dann nur noch Macht und es gibt nur noch diese Parameter zum darin denken.</p>\n\n<p>Sie oder er (der Manager/in) die pflegen ihren Machtstatus. Das ist eine einseitige Interaktion alles dazu herum ist Leere, ein schwarzes Loch. Menschen um sie herum sind alle nur noch Zahlen, egal ob es jetzt der Ehepartner oder die Assistentin ist.</p>', u'post_id': 33726, u'user_id': 3765, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-05 09:26:18', u'title': u'Befragung'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 668, u'user_id': 3270, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-24 22:57:14', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 669, u'user_id': 3270, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-25 00:16:38', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 663, u'user_id': 3250, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-12 20:17:32', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/b38947b9c8a456b26cb6fea0880dc2bc60122fd3" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b38947b9c8a456b26cb6fea0880dc2bc60122fd3.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Children_by_Theophilos_Papadopoulos.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b38947b9c8a456b26cb6fea0880dc2bc60122fd3_1_690x460.jpg" width="690" height="460"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Children_by_Theophilos_Papadopoulos.jpg</span><span class="informations">1024x683 288 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div><br></p>\n\n<p>Si entra alla <a href="http://www.mkiellinikou.org/">Metropolitan Community Clinic di Helliniko</a> da un anonimo piazzale di parcheggio alla periferia di Atene, in un\'area che ospitava una base militare americana, oggi abbandonata. Non sembra molto impressionante. Ma lo \xe8. \xc8 un luogo molto importante.</p>\n\n<p>La MCCH salva vite. Fornisce assistenza sanitaria a persone sfortunate che non hanno accesso alla sanit\xe0 pubblica, n\xe9 denaro per pagarsi quella privata. Ci sono molte persone in questa situazione, perch\xe9 in Grecia l\'accesso al servizio sanitario nazionale \xe8 legato all\'occupazione. Quando un greco perde il lavoro, mantiene l\'assistenza sanitaria per un anno: se dopo un anno non ha trovato un altro lavoro, perde il diritto di accesso al servizio sanitario nazionale. Se si ammala, deve inventarsi qualcosa, o morire.</p>\n\n<p>Non sono solo i  greci. In tutti i paesi europei, tranne il Regno Unito e l\'Italia, la condizione di occupato \xe8 un pre-requisito per accedere all\'assistenza sanitaria. Ma la Grecia \xe8 stata colpita pi\xf9 duramente dalla crisi del 2008: molte pi\xf9 persone che altrove si sono trasformate in disoccupati a lungo termine. "C\'erano poveri anche dieci anni fa \u2013 ci dice Maria, una psicologa che fa volontariato a MCCH \u2013 ma a quel tempo le persone in difficolt\xe0 potevano chiedere aiuto alle famiglie, o ai vicini. Oggi anche le loro famiglie e i loro vicini sono in difficolt\xe0, e non possono fare molto per aiutare gli altri.

"Sapevamo che qualcosa di molto brutto era in arrivo, e che della gente sarebbe morta \u2013 racconta Maria \u2013 Quindi abbiamo deciso che dovevamo fare qualcosa.</p>\n\n<p>"Qualcosa in questo caso \xe8 risultato essere la MCCH stessa. Si tratta di uno strano animale nello zoo dell\'assistenza sanitaria.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Non esiste legalmente</strong>. Il suo materiale proclama fieramente: "MCCH \xe8 un\'organizzazione volontaria senza status legale e non tassabile, e non \xe8 una \'organizzazione not for profit\'."  (Maria: "Tecnicamente siamo illegali".)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Non accetta donazioni in denaro</strong>. Accetta invece donazioni in natura: medicine, attrezzatura, analisi di campioni di sangue.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Occupa una palazzina di propriet\xe0 del Comune di Helliniko-Argyropoulis. <strong>Nonostante nessuno dei suoi dipendenti lavori l\xec, il Comune paga le bollette dell\'elettricit\xe0 e del telefono generate da MCCH</strong>. Il mio cuore batte per l\'anonimo "burocrate hacker" che ha consegnato un edificio pubblico a un gruppo informale di cittadini, che per definizione non pu\xf2 e non vuole firmare contratti o partecipare a bandi.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>\xc8 molto autonoma rispetto alle istituzioni e al potere</strong>. MCCH \xe8 stata proposta per un riconoscimento del Parlamento Europeo chiamato European Citizen\'s Prize 2015, ma l\'ha rifiutato in modo molto pubblico. Motivazione: "L\'Europa \xe8 una delle cause del problema che esistiamo per risolvere. Non dateci premi, cambiate la vostra politica."</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<b>Tratta solo pazienti che non hanno accesso al servizio sanitario nazionale</b>. Un\'eccezione: famiglie numerose a basso reddito, che vivono con 450 euro al mese e semplicemente non hanno denaro per le medicine. (Maria: "Succede.")</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Oltre a diagnosi/prognosi, MCCH fornisce medicine, cibo per neonati e pannolini gratis</strong>.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Ha 300 volontari</strong>, di cui un po\' pi\xf9 della met\xe0 sono medici di varie specializzazioni e farmacisti.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Funziona praticamente senza gerarchie e senza managers. </strong>Ciascun volontario decide da solo in quale ruolo impegnarsi. Lo fa unendosi a un gruppo: ciascun gruppo ha circa 10 membri e esiste per occuparsi di svolgere un compito specifico (per esempio c\'\xe8 un gruppo di accoglienza nuovi pazienti). Un comitato organizzativo fa del suo meglio per tenere ciascun gruppo informato e allineato con gli altri. Una riunione settimanale vota su temi generali. Una mailing list si occupa di temi specifici.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Quando non fanno volontariato con MCCH, <strong>i volontari si scambiano servizi e piccoli favori attraverso una banca del tempo</strong>: due massaggi contro un\'ora di lezione di inglese etc.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Oggi ci sono 68 cliniche organizzate cos\xec in Grecia</strong>. Prendetevi un momento per assorbire le implicazioni di questo fatto: in quattro anni, migliaia di greci intraprendenti, senza denaro, senza una struttura di comando, senza neppure conoscersi, hanno creato un servizio sanitario parallelo che riesce dove il servizio sanitario pubblico e la sanit\xe0 privata falliscono: mantiene in relativa sicurezza gli strati pi\xf9 poveri della popolazione. Da notare: lo stato greco ha speso in sanit\xe0 oltre 6 miliardi di euro nel 2011.</p>\n\n<p>Aspetta un attimo. Masse di persone auto-organizzate, senza soldi e senza organizzazioni, che battono professionisti attentamente selezionati e ben pagati sul loro terreno? Scena gi\xe0 vista. Era Wikipedia che strabatteva Encyclopedia Britannica. Era OpenStreetMap che, regalando i propri dati, vaporizzava il business di Garmin e TomTom. Erano gruppi su Facebook che coordinavano le iniziative di soccorso poche ore dopo il terremoto in Nepal e l\'inondazione di Tbilisi di questa primavera. Erano i giovani inesperti e coordinati via Internet che cambiavano le regole del gioco politico, arrivando ad abbattere interi regimi in Egitto, Tunisia e Ucraina.</p>\n\n<p>Abbiamo una parola per questi fenomeni: li chiamiamo <em>disruption.</em> Sono associati con la produzione di beni o servizi in un modo nuovo, che sostituisce le organizzazioni verticali con l\'intelligenza collettiva e lo sforzo distribuito. Accade che questo modo nuovo \xe8 enormemente pi\xf9 efficiente di quelli vecchi.</p>\n\n<p>Credo che sia arrivato il tempo della <em>disruption</em> nell\'assistenza sanitaria, e nei servizi di cura in generale. Perch\xe9? Perch\xe9, come ha spiegato l\'OCSE, la spesa sanitaria pro capite cresce molto pi\xf9 in fretta del reddito prodotto. Nel 1970, la sanit\xe0 assorbiva un rispettabile 5.2% del PIL del paese sviluppato medio. Nel 2008 ne assorbiva il 10.1% (<a href="http://kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/snapshots-health-care-spending-in-the-united-states-selected-oecd-countries/">fonte</a>). Il sistema \xe8 sotto stress, e spesso \u2013 come in Grecia \u2013 reagisce negando i servizi a chi ne ha pi\xf9 bisogno.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.cottica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Health_care_expenditure.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12715" src="http://www.cottica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Health_care_expenditure.gif" alt="Health care expenditure in some OECD countries, 1970-2015" width="100" height="58"></a></p>\n\n<p>Questo \xe8 moralmente inaccettabile, dissipativo e stupido \u2013 specialmente quando la Metropolitan Community Clinic di Helliniko, e molte altre esperienze simili, hanno mostrato la capacit\xe0 delle comunit\xe0 di prendersi cura dei propri membri quando si permette loro di farlo.</p>\n\n<p>Quindi, ci mettiamo in gioco. La mia nanoimpresa sociale, <a href="/company/home">Edgeryders</a>, si \xe8 associata con cinque organizzazioni di classe mondiale nella ricerca (Univerist\xe0 di Bordeaux, Stockholm School of Economics, ScimPulse Foundation) nelle politiche sociali (Comune di Milano) e nella fabbricazione digitale (WeMake) per trovare le esperienze come MCCH in tutto il mondo, imparare da loro, e se possibile perfezionarne il modello. Il nostro obiettivo \xe8 contribuire a un modello di servizi di cura <em>community-driven, </em> basati sulla scienza e la tecnologia moderna, ma con i bassi costi amministrativi e il tocco umano che le comunit\xe0 hanno e le grandi burocrazie, sia pubbliche che private, no. Il nostro progetto si chiama <a href="/opencare/welcome-to-opencare">OpenCare</a>; la Commissione Europea ci ha creduto abbastanza da sostenerlo attraverso il programma <em>Collective Awareness Platforms.</em></p>\n\n<p>Chiunque tu sia, sei il o la benvenuta a unirti a noi.

The influx of migrants, some people say, will break the European welfare system. Any new person coming in is reducing the amount of care that others can get. Care is supposedly a zero-sum game. Is this really the case?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It turns out that, when faced with care challenges, communities rise to meet them. By doing so, they step outside of our current paradigm, one of provision of care services by a combination of the state and private business. This changes the game completely to one of decentralization and reciprocity. These services often display an uncanny degree of efficiency. So no, care provision does not need to be zero-sum. There are unexploited resources in the system.\xa0 But they cannot easily be added to our existing care system. They are too strange: ad hoc, blurry at the edges, often existing in legal gray areas.

Alberto\u2019s <a href="/t/the-opencare-bigger-picture-for-year-1/5522">Big Picture for Open Care Year 1</a></strong>: we need to collectively contribute to a post publicly outlining our work this year. If no one wants to do it,\xa0Alberto volunteers to write it</p>\n\n<p>Related topic here: Documentation.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Even from last weeks call we discussed some of the constraints in bringing stories from the very ground (In Milano) online and the barriers to participation.</p>\n\n<p>Alberto: It is worrying that documentation is perceived as hard to get, as we wrote it in the proposal and now have to execute.</p>\n\n<p>Rossana: We are waiting to hear from people we are engaging and who would be more comfortable to tell us things that may be private. On the 4th of May we are starting activities of co-design with Milano communities and it would be a better time to collect stories. Also, video operator needs time to process the material etc.</p>\n\n<p>Costa: we are not active on the website, but we will as soon as we have confirmation from the community and partners we engage.</p>\n\n<p>The offline activities are not aligned at the moment with online activities.</p>\n\n<p>Our 1 hour events are not enough to onboard them - Milano events are not conversations yet,\xa0they go one way. These activities are more of a warmup, our hope is to get their attention in the co-design sessions.</p>\n\n<p>Eirini: I know of this EU funded project (crappy UX&gt; sorry). <a href="http://www.innovvoice.com/"></a><a href="http://www.innovvoice.com/">http://www.innovvoice.com/</a> it\'s platform where you can post your challenge/problem and then receive comments and collaborate further on the develpment of some projects (the hacking <span class="mention">@alessandro</span>). quite familiar idea (crowdsourcing innovation). but this is what you are actually proposing as far as I understand\xa0maybe take some ideas from those guys in order to facilitate this sharing and co-creating</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.

A one page website - very simple and clear and explain OpenCare in one minute to anyone. Link to proper resources so people can get more involved.

When you take a closer look at these people you realize how different the motivations of moving are, and\xa0 depending on the motivation how different the goals and approaches are.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>If you decide to go into another country because you are interested in the culture you will most definitely integrate yourself and be open for the odds and difference you will come across. If you are forced to move though, for example because there is a war in your home country the situation is completely different.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>So on one hand we have the people who are moving maybe even because it looks good in your cv if you have lived in Stockholm for a while and then we have people who are forced to leave their countries for economic reasons or/and because its dangerous for them to stay.</p>\n\n<p>So lets think about the people who are forced to leave their countries,\xa0lets say they move to Germany. Maybe because they have heard of Germany somewhere but maybe even out of a coincidence because the help Organisation they first came across was German and then they where broad to Germany. If you think about coming into a country without even finding the culture interesting beforehand you can imagine that there are a lot of weird things and habits you will come across. Also from seeing the other culture you will change the view on your own culture. seeing the differences will make you understand your own culture from a new point of view. like for example if you see people eating with knife and fork and you usually eat with chopsticks thats a moment where you separate from the others and realize just what your culture is actually about.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>This I find very interesting these cultures in cultures. I feel like there might even be a completely new interpretation of your own country. I can only think about food examples right now, like if you go to a restaurant and get \u201etypical food\u201c and then you go to the country and they will never serve you that food, because its a new invention born out of a new interpretation from your own country and culture.</p>\n\n<p>What I find really interesting also is the second Generation. They are born in a society and raised by two probably completely different point of views. They inhabit two cultures, two languages, two patterns of behavior. I see it as a great advantage but also it must be super hard to find yourself between these two poles. So hard to make stuff \u201eright\u201c especially if right here and right there are the compete opposite.</p>\n\n<p>If I think about my friends who are born in two cultures i have a deep respect for why they have already been through sometimes already in their childhood and what they are now. Its so amazing if you are able to understand two cultures and then maybe even distance yourself and analyze the differences. Take the pieces that you like most and combine them. Its definitely a creative task. Well thats maybe my naive way of seeing it because im not that much involved and even if i have been traveling a lot its very superficial and maybe far from really understanding something.</p>\n\n<p>What i\xb4m asking myself is how to show what a great advantage the fusion of two culture can be. Not a clash of culture more a mergence. If you think about this in a really basic way a completely different point of view could probably open your eyes and make you creative.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hacking and Making</strong></p>\n\n<p>To approach this task its important to firstly hack the habits of a culture.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing stuff through the eyes of someone else is a really good step. When i visited my grandma this weekend i broad an old friend with me. My grandparents house is something so familiar to me that i lost the ability to see how interesting they actually are and how much cultural value they have. My friends curiosity had a huge impact on me.

For people who prefer voice interaction, we have Meetups and a weekly Community Call through VOIP. All these are listed on the <a href="/t/op3n-meetups/5297">Meetups page</a>.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>All people who are signed up on edgeryders.eu become community members and agree to the Edgeryders <a href="/en/edgeryders-lbg/help-info">official user, privacy and content licensing policy</a>, made visible to them upon signup.\xa0Members\xa0can post on the website, a point at which they are officially welcomed by community managers. <a class="mention" href="/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> is primarily in charge of welcoming most users as they sign up and\xa0answer any questions they might have about using the space or different projects.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>OpenCare is building\xa0its own consent funnel for participation.

And so on. It\'s your own responsibility to gauge\xa0potential interest from someone and point them to relevant information.</p>\n\n<p>If there isn\'t relevant information available online, don\'t wait for others to do it!

Publishing posts, reading each other and leaving comments to one another\'s contributions\xa0is\xa0how most of the interaction happens.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Content in OpenCare in shared in response to <em>challenges</em>. Challenges are assignments: we describe a problem (for example: what is your experience of giving and receiving care?) and ask the community to respond.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Good practice that you can adopt as much and\xa0as often as possible:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Check the current <a href="/en/op3ncare/helping-one-another-to-discover-what-is">Challenges and responses</a>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Submit your stories</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Leave thoughtful comments to other people\'s stories</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/7a24bac52b42c68f2ed200b26a7dc3d532c4abab" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7a24bac52b42c68f2ed200b26a7dc3d532c4abab.PNG" class="lightbox" title="Stories.PNG"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/7a24bac52b42c68f2ed200b26a7dc3d532c4abab_1_690x449.PNG" width="690" height="449"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Stories.PNG</span><span class="informations">863x562 437 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<h3><a name="Story">Submitting stories</a></h3>\n\n<p>Only users who have created <a href="/user/register">an account</a> on Edgeryders and are logged in with their username and password\xa0can submit stories.</p>\n\n<p>When submitting a story, the user is taken through a number of steps in order to clarify which challenge the story is answering, what personal question is the person trying to figure out, who would be an audience that they prefer, and what general topics they want to file the story under. The editing interface makes it possible to input text, links, to upload images or to embed video or audio files (using the HTML source).</p>\n\n<p>When users create a new piece of content, the other community members who have contributed previously in OpenCare will receive an email notification. Same is true when someone comments other stories.</p>\n\n<h3><a name="Language">Euro English as language </a></h3>\n\n<p>For a project with such a strong social networking element, it is absolutely essential that people can interact without mediation nor delay: having someone translate everything we post would be not only impossibly expensive: it would dampen interaction and feedback, making the Open\xa0experience quite miserable. To get around this problem, we have agreed to encode some rules in the social bargain of Open Care.</p>\n\n<p>These are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>you are welcome to write in your own language. People can always get the gist of what you are writing by running it through Google Translate; however, we encourage you to write in Euro English, the lingua franca the majority of young Europeans use when they move about. I wrote Euro English, and I specifically don\'t mean the Queen\'s English: the former is an inclusive, connecting language that most youth speak enough to communicate, the latter is just another language, with its own solid grammar, pronunciation niceties and idiosyncrasies. There are many more people that speak Euro English, than people who speak the Queen\'s English.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Community members agree to be tolerant of each other\'s grammar or spelling mistakes. No one is allowed to look down at anyone else for this. We are not stupid or under-educated, we are just writing in a foreign language. Our effort to communicate deserves respect.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Community members who are native speakers of English are kindly requested to keep in mind they are part of a global community, and make their own effort to write in a simple, clear manner.\xa0</li>\n\n</ul><h3><a name="Anon">Right to privacy and\xa0anonymity </a></h3>\n\n<p>Given the sensitivity of a topic like care, we\xa0are encouraging members to feel confortable writing online, but we are aware that this may not be the case for everyone. All our team members are aware of this setback and make it possible for people to submit materials or write their personal stories in two ways: 1) creating a user profile\xa0which is not linked in any way to their real identity and uploading content from that account or 2) emailing stories and have one of the Open Care curators upload for them.</p>\n\n<h3><a name="Anon">Research data </a></h3>\n\n<p>All written content submitted in the OpenCare online\xa0spaces will be\xa0aggregated, coded and analysed\xa0by researchers\xa0and in agreement with our Data Strategy. For details about the Open Care research, see our original proposal available <a href="/t/project/4861">here</a>\xa0(pp.18-19).</p>\n\n<h2><a name="Eng">Other Online engagement tools and practices</a></h2><h3><a name="Meetups">Meetups</a></h3>\n\n<p>Meetups are offline or offline\xa0activities and events where community gets together.\xa0OpenCare partners and members are encouraged to run OpenCare activities and announce them as Meetups on the Community Space. They can be as small as a presentation at an conference, or a community Meet and Greet.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Partners are already receiving invitations to tell about OpenCare in conferences, university lectures, hackathons etc. Our criterion for accepting or rejecting these invitations is their potential for engagement.\xa0We do not recommend accepting last-minute invitations: allow\xa0a minimum of two weeks lead time. This way,\xa0all of us involved can spread the news that someone in our team is going to be presenting in venue X on day Y, and\xa0reach out to others who might join you.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Please post all your intended activities (online/offline, public meetings, conferences\xa0etc)\xa0as events in the Community space:\xa0\xa0\xa0</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Click\xa0<a href="/node/add/event?og_group_ref=5954">here</a>.\xa0</p></li>\n<li><p>Enter the information you have prepared for your session. Make sure you also include an image to act as a logo, it will make your event look better on the page. Logos for events are available\xa0<a href="/en/opencare/visual-material-logos-banners-headers-videos-etc">here</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Enter your preferred date and time in the relevant fields.\xa0</p></li>\n<li><p>Click Save, you\'re all set. The event will be listed on the <a href="/en/op3ncare/op3n-meetups">Op3nCare Meetups page</a>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now the next step is to build interest and discussion around your event, email and share the link in your own networks. Use #op3ncare\xa0so we can help spread it through the Op3nCare social media accounts.</p>\n\n<h3><a name="Hangouts">Hangouts</a></h3>\n\n<p>Hangouts are weekly, online and open events where anyone can join.</p>\n\n<p>As of April 2016, hangouts happen every Monday at 4:30 PM CET. We are still looking for that perfect open source videoconferencing solution, so\xa0check the Events page and follow the instructions there.</p>\n\n<p>Also known as Op3nCare community calls, they serve two purposes at the same time: team coordination and welcoming new people. If you\'re attending the next, make sure to set the agenda by leaving comments to them.\xa0Every weeks call will be listed on the <a href="/en/op3ncare/op3n-meetups%20">Op3n Meetups page</a>.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>If you would like a call exceptionally scheduled, feel free to propose it, write, upload it, and run it (see Communicating your events above).</p>\n\n<p>If you are running an activity in Open Care that needs a separate community event, feel free to propose it, write it, and run it (see Meetups section above).\xa0</p>\n\n<h3><a name="Loud">Working out loud</a></h3>\n\n<p>The OpenCare research team is committed to publishing regular public posts to help community members keep track of what is going on and be able to plug in at any time.\xa0Posts in the OpenCare workgroup marked as such in their title (e.g. [Working out loud] <em>Name of post</em>). They are\xa0summaries\xa0of what needs your attention\xa0every 2\xa0weeks, feeding in and out of the community calls. Written by <a class="mention" href="/u/noemi">@Noemi</a> and other community managers (an example <a href="/t/working-out-loud-stories-collection-and-making-opencare-more-accessible-to-groups-we-connect-with-offline/5511">here</a>).</p>\n\n<h3><a name="Mail">Mailing lists</a></h3>\n\n<p>An OpenCare list of supporters and interested people is growing.

It\'s called\xa0<a href="http://hackingutopia.cre8tives.org/about/">Hacking Utopia- #OpenCare for social and demographic change</a>\xa0and was born out of our shared experiences as designers.</p>\n\n<p>More specifically the frustration with outdated design education that ill prepares students to be able to do meaningful work with their skills and talents. We feel that this should start already during their education so by the time they have graduated they are already up and running their own exciting projects that really contribute towards tackling some of the bigger challenges which affect us all. \xa0After a lot of work over the past couple of months, especially by Susa, the partnership agreement between Edgeryders and UDK was finalised and last week we launched the first ever edition of this course with a four-day intense workshop.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next six months each student will be working on design research and product development process that departs from the OpenCare topic and methodologies.

To start with such a question a lot comes to mind. Especially after this intense first day of our project kick-off at Sauen, with all these great thoughts, ideas and reflections about what it means to be a human being. I am personally fascinated by the cognitive dissonance I find myself stuck in. This applies to so many aspects of my life. Yes, talking is easy, acting takes effort. It\'s the same with design, having a nice idea over a glass of wine in the evening? No big deal. But bringing it into life, really doing it and going against all obstacles is a totally different thing. It needs energy, dedication, belief, trust, confidence, help. You need to CARE about it enough to put it into action. So that\'s one aspect of care. That something/someone has enough value or meaning for somebody to be considered with putting real physical action into it. Usually this is the fact when we are affected personally. When it\'s a personal thing. When we are involved. When we are touched. When we are concerned.</p>\n\n<p>The expression "taking care of something" as a German is a rather rational, dry and goal-oriented task. It somehow misses the core of its literal meaning which is a soft, emotional and gentle interaction. So how do we define this word? How does the culture we live in put it into action? How is it valued, honored? Who should we care for, what should we take care of and most importantly: what is so dear to us that we want to take care of it? Are we being taken care of enough to give something back? We discussed the question of how can something seemingly burden full turn into a joyful engagement. How can we overcome this cognitive dissonance and what is that undefined obstacle that holds us \u200bback. Because it\'s not laziness. It\'s not carelessness. Maybe it\'s a combination of helplessness (of where to start, what to focus), being overwhelmed (by one\'s own life and tasks) and alone (with an ambition too big for one person). And maybe the answer of today is community.</p>', u'post_id': 650, u'user_id': 26, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-04 21:13:53', u'title': u'Care = Community'}, {u'content': u'<p><em>Post was originally authored by Dougald Hine on 2013-10-30 08:39:00 +0100</em></p>\n\n<p>In one of his darkly observant essays on the fall of the Soviet Union and its lessons for present-day America, Dmitri Orlov advises against being a successful middle-aged man : </p>\n\n<blockquote><p>When their career is suddenly over, their savings gone and their property worthless, much of their sense of self-worth goes as well. They tend to drink themselves to death and commit suicide in disproportionate numbers. Since they tend to be the most experienced and capable people, this is a staggering loss to society. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Collapse-Experience-American-Prospects/dp/0865716854" rel="nofollow noopener">Reinventing Collapse</a>, p.122-3)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The spike in mortality that accompanied the fall of the Soviet Union has few parallels in history. Between 1987 and 1994, life expectancy dropped from 70 to 64, and the group whose likelihood of dying increased most sharply was, indeed, working age men. In other words, despite the material hardships of the period, it was not the weakest and most vulnerable who died in greater numbers, but the physically strong: what was most deadly about the collapse was not the disappearance of the means of staying alive, but the lack of ends for which to stay alive.</p>\n\n<p>Europe is not going through a Soviet-style collapse. (Or not yet: <a href="http://ppac.tumblr.com/post/41354009871/break-up-costs" rel="nofollow noopener">a report from UBS Investment Research</a> in September 2011 estimated the costs of a break-up of the Eurozone at 40-50% of weaker countries\u2019 GDP in the first year and 20-25% of the GDP of countries like Germany. For comparison, the total fall in GDP during the break-up of the USSR is estimated at 45%, spread over the years from 1989 to 1998.) The point I want to draw from Orlov, however, is that there is a powerful and complex interrelation between how we make a living and how we make sense of our lives. The consequences of an economic crisis can both lead to and be made worse by the crisis of meaning experienced by those whose lives it has derailed. If this is the case, however, perhaps it is also possible that action on the level of meaning might stem and even reverse the consequences, personal and social, of failing economic systems?</p>\n\n<p>The figure of the \u2018graduate with no future\u2019, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2011/02/twenty_reasons_why_its_kicking.html" rel="nofollow noopener">identified by Paul Mason</a>, has the advantage of youth, yet in other ways she resembles Orlov\u2019s successful middle-aged man. People are capable of enduring great hardship, so long as they can find meaning in their situation, but it is hard to find meaning in the hundredth rejection letter. The feeling of having done everything right and still got nowhere leads to a particular desperation. Against this background, the actions of those who might identify with Mason\u2019s description - whether as indignados in the squares of Spain, or as Edgeryders entering the corridors of Strasbourg and Brussels - are not least a search for meaning, for new frameworks in which to make sense of our lives when the promises that framed the labour market for our parents no longer ring true.</p>\n\n<p> Four years ago, in <a href="http://dougald.co.uk/writing/dougald_futureofunemployment_feb09.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">\u2018The Future of Unemployment\u2019</a>, I suggested that it might be helpful to distinguish three types of need which, broadly speaking, we have looked to employment to provide. I want to return to this model as a way of structuring a search for examples of effective action on the level of meaning. Departing slightly from the original terms, I would summarise these types of need as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Economic/Practical</strong>: How do I pay the rent?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Social/Psychological</strong>: Who am I in the eyes of others?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Directional</strong>: What do I get out of bed for in the morning? And where do I see myself in the future?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Those who find it difficult to access the labour market are also likely to find answering these questions more difficult. The stories shared on the Edgeryders platform during 2011-12 illustrate the variety of ways in which young people find their access the labour market limited: not only through unemployment, but underemployment, casualisation and the prevalence of short-term contracts, the increasing cost of education in certain countries, the role of unpaid internships as a path to accessing certain industries. Where skills and qualifications have been acquired through formal education, many find themselves unable to secure work that makes use of these; where skills are acquired informally, the challenge is to represent these effectively to potential employers. Above all, the situation is defined by the interaction between two major processes: a long-term change in the structure of European labour markets, offering new entrants a poorer deal than had been the case for their parents\u2019 generation, has been exacerbated by the effects of the economic crisis that began in 2008.</p>\n\n<p>If the situation of those struggling to access the labour market can be expressed in terms of the three types of need set out above, we might note that the last two belong primarily to the domain of meaning: our ability to answer them is closely related to our ability to make sense of our lives. Based on this, I suggest that we look for two stages in projects that might constitute effective action on the level of meaning: first, the ability to substitute for employment in providing social identity and a sense of direction; and, second, the potential for this to lead to new means of meeting practical needs.</p>\n\n<p>With this structure in mind, I want to consider briefly a few examples which I think offer clues to what this may look like in practice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Centers for New Work</strong>: During the collapse in employment in the US auto industry in the early 1980s, the philosopher Frithjof Bergmann worked with employers, unions and community organisations in Flint, Michigan to create the <a href="http://www.context.org/iclib/ic37/bergmann/" rel="nofollow noopener">Center for New Work</a>. \u2018We are in the beginning of a great scarcity of jobs,\u2019 <a href="http://newworknewculture.com/sites/default/files/scan%201.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Bergmann argued</a>, \u2018but not of work.\u2019 Instead of making redundancies, he proposed that employers share out the remaining jobs on a rotating work schedule. Workers would alternate between extended periods in traditional industrial work and similar periods pursuing \u2018New Work\u2019. The latter included local production to meet practical needs, but also the right of everyone to spend a significant amount of their time pursuing a personally meaningful project.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Access Space</strong>: In Sheffield, England - another post-industrial city, similarly hit by unemployment in the early 1980s - the artist James Wallbank and friends set up what has become <a href="http://www.access-space.org/doku.php" rel="nofollow noopener">the UK\u2019s longest-running free internet learning centre</a>. As <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/news_and_features/britains_new_radicals/access_space" rel="nofollow noopener">described by NESTA</a>, \u2018The centre brings together old computers and new open source software to create a radical, sustainable response to industrial decline and social dislocation.\u2019 In conversation, Wallbank has emphasised to me the importance of the social and directional role of participation at Access Space: for those who have been long-term unemployed, the change in the shape of their lives on becoming a regular participant is often huge; by comparison, the change from being a regular participant to entering employment is relatively small. From my own observation, another key aspect of the Access Space model is the power of its insistence on self-referral: this means that participants are drawn from a range of social and economic backgrounds, rather than exclusively from a target group identified by its deprivation. This means that participation at the centre provides an alternative to - rather than a reinforcement of - a negative social identification.</p>\n\n<p><strong>West Norwood Feast</strong>: In 2010-11, <a href="http://spacemakers.info/" rel="nofollow noopener">the agency I founded</a> led a project to co-create <a href="http://westnorwoodfeast.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener">a community-owned and -run street market</a> in south London. This experience reaffirmed my sense of the power of what people can do when they come together to work on something that matters to them. In particular, talking to those involved, I was struck by how positively many of them experienced using their skills as part of the Feast, when compared to their experience in regular employment. Might it be that work that takes place outside of employment is more likely to be experienced as meaningful? And, if so, why? Several possible answers exist. The psychologist Edward Deci famously demonstrated that <a href="http://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/1971_Deci.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">being paid for a task tends to decrease our intrinsic motivation</a>, a phenomenon he explains in terms of the shift of the \u2018locus of motivation\u2019. Meanwhile, as I argued in <a href="http://dougald.co.uk/writing/dougald_spacehackers_dec10.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">\u2018The Future We Deserve\u2019</a>, the logic of maximising productivity has made industrial-era employment an unprecedentedly anti-social form of work. More practically, though, are there ways we can build a better relationship between meaningful work and our ability to pay the rent?</p>\n\n<p><strong>House concerts</strong>: The music industry has been through huge disruption since the 1990s, not least as a result of the rise of filesharing. The solo bass player <a href="http://twitter.com/solobasssteve" rel="nofollow noopener">Steve Lawson</a> is an example of an independent musician who has spent his career developing new models for making a living and documenting the realities of this on his blog. He sells <a href="http://music.stevelawson.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">downloads of his albums</a> on a pay-what-you-want basis and makes \u2018house concert\u2019 tours on which he plays in the front rooms of fans, many of whom have first met him online. Reading his accounts of this, two things are clear: first, that these models, drawing on the strengths of networked technologies, allow for <a href="http://www.stevelawson.net/2009/03/celebrity-20-fame-in-a-conversation-economy/" rel="nofollow noopener">a far more meaningful relationship</a> with his audience than was possible in the music industry of the pre-Napster era; and, second, that house concerts also <a href="http://www.stevelawson.net/2009/02/real-life-touring-a-social-media-fuelled-tale/" rel="nofollow noopener">make touring economically viable</a> for independent musicians in a way that was harder when playing traditional venues. Are there other areas in which socially-embedded grassroots economies can thrive where high-overhead conventional economies struggle? (For another take on the potential of low-overhead economic models, see Kevin Carson\u2019s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Homebrew-Industrial-Revolution-Low-Overhead-Manifesto/dp/1439266999" rel="nofollow noopener">The Homebrew Industrial Revolution</a>.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Unmonastery</strong>: One of the projects to emerge from the first phase of Edgeryders was a proposal for something called an <a href="https://twitter.com/unmonastery" rel="nofollow noopener">Unmonastery</a>: \u2018a creative refuge bound to host problem solvers and change makers, who together work to solve (g)local problems, in exchange for board and lodging.\u2019 At present, this proposal is being developed by a group that met through the Living on the Edge events in 2012. The initial response suggests that young people are willing to take a step down in their material expectations, if this is balanced by sufficient security and autonomy to pursue work which they believe matters. The challenge will be to develop a vehicle for this willingness which is capable of \u2018interfacing\u2019 with existing institutions and accessing resources, which can achieve a reasonable degree of stability, and which does not devolve into a mechanism for exploitation. Daunting as this sounds, it is likely that we will see more experiments along these lines in Europe in the years ahead. (<a href="http://www.edventurefrome.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Edventure: Frome</a>, which launched in October 2012, has parallels to the Unmonastery model, although framed in educational terms.)</p>\n\n<p>Five years into the current crisis, the default future for much of Europe is a world of longer hours and lower wages. Economic regeneration as we have known it could hardly keep up with the social costs of industrial decline, even during periods of sustained growth. That economic collapse can lead into and become entrenched by a collapse of meaning is not just a post-Soviet story, but one that can be traced in many of Europe\'s former industrial regions, not least the areas of South Yorkshire where I once worked as a journalist.</p>\n\n<p>The scale and harshness of those realities makes me hesitate: I do not want to overstate the case for the examples I have discussed here. Yet I would suggest that they may offer clues, at least, towards another kind of regeneration: what might be called a \u2018regeneration of meaning\u2019. There is no guarantee that this will happen, nor that, if it does, it will take the kind of form we would wish to see. However, for those who consider the possibility worth exploring, I have a few questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li><strong>What would it take for this to coalesce into something serious?</strong></li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>How far along is it already?</strong> (Is it further than we/others assume, due to its illegibility?)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li><strong>Where are the other examples that would build the case?</strong></li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>What are the dangers?</strong> (For example, could the Unmonastery inadvertently become <a href="http://www.chiddingstone.kent.sch.uk/homework/victorians/workhouses.html" rel="nofollow noopener">the workhouse</a> of the 21st century?)</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>Image credit: Listening to the Walls - Photo by Bembo Davies, Institute of non-toxic propaganda</em></p>', u'post_id': 493, u'user_id': 15, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-01 09:06:06', u'title': u'The Regeneration of Meaning'}, {u'content': u'<p><strong>Four years ago, as we were planning our move to Brussels, <a href="http://www.cottica.net/2012/05/05/are-you-serious-about-lifestyle-innovation-collaborative-living-in-brussels/">Nadia and I decided to look for flatmates</a>.</strong> Most of our friends and family members were rather puzzled: not many couples decide to share their apartment, though they can afford not to. We, however, thought it completely logical. Nadia is Swedish and I am Italian: at the time we lived in Strasbourg, France. That made us a migrant nuclear family, completely cut off from the network of emotional and material support that our friends and families of origin could offer. We were simply too isolated in our Strasbourg apartment, nice though it was; and we decided to try something different. So, we rented a much bigger apartment than we needed and asked the Internet for someone to share it with.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Four years on, we think the experiment worked.</strong> For the last three years we have been living with Kasia and Pierre, a young couple of expatriates (Kasia is Polish, Pierre French). We really enjoy the co-habitation: the home feels more animated, and not a day goes by that we don\'t chat at least a little bit, over coffee or breakfast. We enjoy the big, airy living room overlooking the city. And, frankly, we appreciate that our lifestyle is really good value for money: thanks to the economies of scale implicit in family life, we pay a reasonable rent for a really nice space.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Along the way, we discovered that what makes our living together so enjoyable is that we are so different from each other.</strong> We come from four different countries; we are of different ages (Pierre, the youngest, is 19 years younger than me, the oldest); we have very different jobs (Kasia is a dental nurse, Pierre is the manager of a fashion boutique, whereas Nadia and I both belong to the "what is it that you do, again?" tribe); Nadia and I travel a lot, whereas Kasia and Pierre tend to be in town most of the time.</p>\n\n<p>This works well on many levels. On a purely practical level, when we travel we love the thought that the home is not empty, and in the event of some misfortune (think plumbing failure) they can intervene; and I am sure they enjoy the privacy and the extra space. We pay for electricity, phone and the Internet, they pay for the cleaning services \u2013 less paperwork to do. We have an extra room, which normally serves as Nadia\'s and my office; but it doubles up as a guest room for the guests of all of us.</p>\n\n<p>But there is more to co-habitation than practicality. <strong>Kasia and Pierre are lovely people: and, crucially, they are <em>different</em> people from Nadia and myself</strong>. We live out the city in different ways. We have different takes on almost everything, from French politics to Belgian beer. Comparing notes with them is always interesting, and I really value their insights and wisdom. Not that we spend all that much time together. I think our co-habitation unfolded in the right sequence: we started by a default attitude of rigorous mutual respect of each other\'s privacy and spaces. Then, over time, we grew closer, started to share the occasional meal, the occasional outing; we met each other\'s friends and families, lovely people to the last one. Guess what: we have built a sort of familial-like arrangement in a foreign city, among people who were originally complete strangers to one another.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s working well. So well that, when a year ago our landlord announced that he was reclaiming his apartment and we would have to move out in the summer, <strong>we decided to stay together, and to look for a new place as a four-people household</strong>. Eventually, we got more ambitious and thought, what the hell, we might as well grow the family. If four people can live so well together in a larger apartment, how would it work with five, or six, or seven in an even larger one?</p>\n\n<p>It works well, it turns out. We moved to a lovely loft, and were joined by a third couple (Belgian-Italian). Giovanni and Ilaria have since moved on for family reasons, but we enjoyed their company while we lived together. Their place has been claimed by Thomas, a young French engineer.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>We do this for totally egoistic reasons: we enjoy each other\'s company, we save money, we live in style. At the same time,<strong> we are aware that we are working our way through solving a global problem</strong>. Planet Earth has <a href="http://www.oecd.org/els/mig/World-Migration-in-Figures.pdf">230 million international migrants</a>; intra-EU migrants like us <a href="http://hiva.kuleuven.be/nl/docs/presentaties/20141013_03_LaurentAujean.pdf">are 8 million</a>. Many of Europe\'s young people simply cannot afford to hold their ground: their work, education paths, and love lives lead them to migrate. When they do, they, like us, lose their supporting networks, and it is really hard to rebuild them. Living together, especially in diversity \u2013 the older with the younger, the sporty with the mobility-challenged, the academic with the blue-collar worker \u2013 becomes a platform for sharing our different abilities, and being able, as a household, to solve many different problems, both emotional and practical.</p>\n\n<p>None of this is new. You have heard it all before \u2013 at social innovation conferences and workshops, for example, and typically by people who live in middle-class nuclear families. <strong>But we have decided to walk this particular talk;</strong> it will probably not be the right choice for everyone, but it is the right choice Nadia, Kasia, Pierre and myself; and I strongly believe it might be right for many others. I encourage you to at least consider it for yourself: as more of us make this choice, the real estate market will respond, giving us more spaces suited to our particular lifestyle (in Brussels, for example, is very difficult to find large apartments with 3 or more bathrooms!).\xa0So, who wants to join?</p>', u'post_id': 648, u'user_id': 4, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-01 08:20:09', u'title': u'Living Social In Brussels: co-living as a lifestyle for grown-ups'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 656, u'user_id': 3235, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-06 17:10:44', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>I am Moushira.

I will be writing a separate post, or possibly even series of posts as the conversations were very rich and offered a lot of things to think about and explore around care.</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cIt was a good experience, I liked meeting people from different backgrounds and the possibility for working together\u2026 Discovering what we each are good and not good at, and how they can fit together. \xa0As well as what these different backgrounds creates as a perspective towards the project\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor me exploring new projects and ways of working is not new, so changing my setup is not new. Converting ideas to communities. Setting up a framework that people can work within. But for product designers is not the case. I could understand Nadia\u2019s language well..It could be good to translate the language and vocabulary used by the OpenCare project into language easier to use for product designers. Designers are mostly visual, other disciplines less so. Some bridging of languages could be helpful.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe were discussing the questions on the wall- what care means on fundamental level to us. Under which conditions care is being granted in a community and what that means for us. When discussing integration of people into a group, the separation you make in the beginning affects the integration project...You say there is an external person who should adapt to the community itself, instead of thinking about creating something new from scratch out of the welcoming community and new individials. Especially when you talk about care...you always do the labelling that there is someone who needs help, and I am one to provide help. Maybe getting rid of these labels is important. Also we talked about how social relations to certain people are necessary for providing some kinds of care. And how to solve challenges of providing care for people we don\u2019t already know. You touch people physically (as we did in the opening session today) and it changes relationship immediately e.g. free hugs in public spaces: This changes something very fast. Especially in regards to refugee topic\u2026.Before helping there should be a contact, a communication with people before offering help whether you know they need or not.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201c We started different no thinking about projects, but our own experiences being people on the move.\xa0</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li><em>Being somewhere where you chose to go</em></li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li><em>Being somewhere you didn't\u2019 pick: job, being refugee, \xa0being moved by parents...how it affects your mindset</em></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>What is the difference between these two in terms of care on the move?</em></p>\n\n<p>One person was talking about being in china for job of her father to experience completely difft culture and not being free to decide to go there\u2026.vs choosing to move to a new city voluntarily in a city where many different cultures in Kreuzberg. Just getting to know different food and culture at a very young age and getting to know this in a playful way without much prejudice in your head\u201d</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe started off by talking about situations in our lives where we have given care, or seen other people receiving care. Who are those people who have taken on traditional care of caregiving? We quickly started talking about feminist issues and women being caregivers through history. We also talked about the rewards, how giving care is valued, if valued at all or you get financial remuneration\u2026\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe were all answering the question of why we chose the different topics and why we chose them. Mine was about being on the move and the point that is for me very importan is the idea of doing something fo the first time and you have to cope, no matter if you have to do a job or ...you are always doing for the first time. Found a sory in newspaper about caregivers and they tried to set up school for nurses where they given puppets they have to be with for weeks before working with humans. Switch perspective. I found a flyer which was something like a manual for shopping in supermarket in the fifties..they were handing flyers out about how to behave and shop in he supermarket and now people are complaining about refugees not knowing \xa0how to behave the first time...there is an arrogance... What is possible with products etc to switch perspective and lose embarrassment etc around doing something for the first time. People \u201cmisbehave\u201d because. The first time I met a Syrian guy was during the refugee crisis, it was first time experience for both of us, no just him.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe were mostly talking about first time experience of meeting some guys from syria. How can we start meeting people on a high level and not relationship that we are giving, and they are receiving donations. That we are both receiving and giving care.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe started talking about experiences and what think about care, or what we need for our self to be cared for or give care. I found that we had really different ways of talking or explaining. I had difficulties to say what I was thinking and they only understood me when I made examples. And they totally understood me. But when Nema started talking, she could really articulate herself without giving examples. It\u2019s really interesting as a product designer.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe talked about personal experiences. Because of this we came to many topics- like how it is to be a European or come from another continent. It was nice because we had an open chat with one another, so we had some long discussions. It was nice to hear about other people\u2019s stories because sometimes you don\u2019t talk about it for long, but when you do it for one hour and you have some perspectives on how to give care for refugees but also what it\u2019s like to be a foreigner in Germany.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cUnter sich haben sie die kulturellen Unterschiede nicht wirklich gemerkt, wenn man gemeinsam mit vielen Kulturen aufwaechst. Der einzige Unterschied, der immer da bleibt, und erfahrbar ist, ist der kulinarische Unterschied. Vielleicht ist die Perspektive eines Kindes die beste: Unvoreingenommen Dinge aufnehmen, ohne sie direkt zu beurteilen. Gerade als Kind ist es eine grosse Bereicherung, auf so viele unterschiedliche Kulturen zu treffen. Fuer die Erziehung und die Ausbildung der eigenen Persoenlichkeit ist es absolut foerderlich, in Konfrontation mit vielen Kulturen aufzuwachsen.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe had a discussion about \u201cstranger danger\u201d. Which I have recently been having with people from older generations. When it comes to refugee crisis , even people I know that normally would act very human and never put themselves above another suddenly are afraid when refugees come to the country. In part it is because of the lack of contact; they don\u2019t come naturally to a place where exchange could happen in an uncontrived way. How could this be set up, or how could it happen? We talked about how younger people can be a connector, how it needs a connector...there are many of us who want to engage but don't because the connection is needed and doesn\u2019t happen without being designed. When travelling connecting is very easy, but in your own town you rarely have deep conversations with people you don\u2019t know. Openness as a mindset is very interesting to see how society is structured n our head. How this huge fear that comes out of nowhere. Media says you should have fear now, that the new is threatening. I love my Grandma but when it comes to this topic I think omg we should not even talk about this topic and I have no idea how to change things. I think it\u2019s a lot of empathy, we had a huge fight...it was all about him not letting what\u2019s happen...not wanting to feel it...keeping it theoretical. The next day there was a change of perspective. It\u2019s also overwhelming for many people, related to make yourself vulnerable and allowing yourself to feel. It\u2019s a very delicate and sensitive how to do this contact and get them in touch with their feelings.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe were talking about different languages. To map out what we can as GWK and product designers (UDK) and to figure out what is the responsibility towards what we are studying. Until now what designers were doing and what we were studying was just about making things beautiful. Are we even responsible towards building towards big visions the way \xa0OpenCare is doing? As designers we are always looked upon in a very belittling way - as though we are not capable of contributing to the big issues. But I believe it is part of our responsibility as designers to do this work, because ideally we are focusing not on profiting from it but we can do it just to help. Everyone knows we should help, but no one really does it and people still have prejudices and discriminate. Not many of us know how it is to lead a refugee\u2019s life. How many of us have been discriminated against? For me I was born in Germany, but for a moment I thought well all the refugee circus that is going on has nothing to do with me and I thought it is the responsibility of larger organisations like NGos and the Government to deal with...I asked myself what capacity do I realistically have to help. Then I realised that as someone born in Germany, I walk around the street I hear people discriminating against Asians. And I realised it does affect me, and it is my responsibility to help...It is about the right to be a creative and work not just for profit, but \xa0to help others and how this is deeply human at its core.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cI think it is always important to find new symbiotic relationships between people. One Project I\u2019ve come across is one in which there were two groups: one group who wanted to learn English but didnt have connections to do so, and the other group was old lonely group from America. These two groups were able to talk to each other via skype. The Old people had the joy of talking to somebody who was interested in learning. And the young people learned English. It\u2019s very nice to see people caring about each other that way.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cFor me it was very interesting to hear what makes something seem foreign and why we feel home. What makes this happen?\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe were still thinking about what is th goal of being a designer and what is a design process...what is the difference to art or to management/managers job? We came to the point that an artist is focusing on showing problem and designer is trying to find solution and manager is more focused on company\u2019s project and not so much on helping people. It\u2019s a beginning of a discussion.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe were not talking about the differences between student areas. It was interesting seeing how there was a lot of variation in how interviews were conducted in the different groups as well as within the group were different. I think what I found was that we had very different styles of leading interviews and how different results. I realised I am used to lead an interview and how it has become my only way for me. And it was really interesting to see there are different kinds of ways to lead an interview. I learned how to lead interviews in design thinking...you are asking for stories and ask 5 times why. It\u2019s completely differnt thing when trying to understand a person. It was a very good experience. And apart from that my main insight is that care is always interactional, its not a one way street. The system of capitalism is making it a one way street because there s wlays money in and something out. It\u2019s not evolutionary.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe talked about the relationships that we have with people from Syria that we know and the experiences we have with them. We try to know why German people are so scared of foreigners and why the German people are sometimes so closed also in a friendship. For example my first time was not so easy to make friends here, german people are really closed the first time..they are not so open to stangers.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cIt was really intersting hearing about your experiences and the difficulties you had. Very interesting to talk from a personal perspectives and the fears you have.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe discussed the five questions we were given. What I noticed te most that care is a very difficult term. We couldn;t find a term for care in german. This is one part that makes the discussion very interesting but also very difficult. A whole lot of people are going in a direction towards the refugee topic, that seems to be very close to people. I heard about a book from two journalists about political language: some words and terms that are used are producing certain realities. When you use some words regularly especially in the media, it becomes a reality and then there is no alternative. Translating care into a german word, and speaking about it means very different thing.\u201d\xa0</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe also tried to approach the topic from a more general angle, what care really means for us. We came to conclusion that care, giving and receiving, is a basic human need and a human right. It\u2019s not a one-way street, but we need to talk about care as a devalued thing in our society. There are people who really love to give are and do not have the right to get something for it. We thought about how to make people who give care more visible. How can we provide some kind of reward or value for the volunteers. And of course we went in the feminist direction but I think it is a really important thing to value care as a huge thing in society.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cCare which we translated into Pfleger. Has not only to do with caring about other people and also for yourself. Is it important to care for yourself first or the other way around? It\u2019s a challenge to care for huge number of people at once. Monetization and how it affects our view on people around us: that we cannot be more intuitive because we think about how we can be most effective.This question where german politicians are saying we have to take care of our people, and not just give everything away. Same thing at a different scale. We have to look at how we distributed in different ways. I would like to see politicians say how they care for themselves, I would like to see them living a lifestyle which shows people how to live a healthy life.\u201d</em></p>", u'post_id': 494, u'user_id': 8, u'timestamp': u'2016-04-04 21:08:33', u'title': u'You and me and everyone we know: The many faces of care'}, {u'content': u'<p>Local staff of opencare (Comune di Milano and WeMake) meets some parents of boys and girls with different abilities.\xa0The presentation will take place @ WeMake (Via Stefanardo da Vimercate 27/5 in Milan - MM1 Gorla) on 30 march 2016. h. 4.00 pm</p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/a/af05e6f47a6a1e7f350e9fa2de8d3864d0906b73.jpg" width="640" height="478"></p>', u'post_id': 5490, u'user_id': 2481, u'timestamp': u'2016-03-24 16:48:59', u'title': u'OpenCare Outreach Events | Meeting with families with boys and girls with disabilities, 30 March 2016, Milan - 4.00 pm #LocalActivity'}, {u'content': u'<p>For most of humanity\'s history, care services \u2013 which today we call health and social care \u2013 were provided by communities: family members, friends and neighbours would check on each other to make sure everyone was fine, keep an eye on each other\'s children or elderly parents, even administer simple medical treatments. Starting from the second half of the 20th century, developed countries switched to systems where the care providers were professionals, working for the government and modern corporations.</p>\n\n<p>This new solution has achieved brilliant results, based on the deployment of scientific knowledge and technology. However, over the past 20 years it has come under growing strain: the demand for professional care (health care, social care, daycare for children, care for elderly people\u2026) seems limitless, but the resources our economies allocate to it clearly are not. Additionally, any attempt to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are going to attempt to do just that. We are launching OpenCare, a two-year, 1.6 million euro research project to design and prototype new care services. We will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>collect experiences of community-driven care services</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>validate them through open discussion, both online and offline.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>augment them with state-of-the-art maker technology (3D printing, laser cutting, biohacking\u2026)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>combine everything we learn into the design and prototype of next generation community driven care services.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is way too ambitious for us to do alone, so we\'ll do it with everybody, leveraging collective intelligence. The whole process will be \u2013 and stay \u2013 open to anyone who wants to participate. We are working on a social contract to acknowledge each and every contribution, and will not make participants into a crowd of rightless volunteers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Care is deeply human</strong>. Everyone has first-hand experience of it. Even those if us who are not doctors or nurses or caregivers are occasionally patients (even doctors!); we all have first-hand experience of giving and receving care.

With more refugees arriving you both have an increase in number of people to care for, and different kinds of needs which is being framed as the source of " chaos in the system". <em>Perhaps it would make sense to look at how health- and social care is being managed both in the camps and temporary receoption centres, as well as in the mainstream healthcare providers. </em><br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t\tIs there a distincting between the NHS overall (long term) and the temporary refugee situation:\xa0<em> Is it just a question of money, or are/were there some things that can be improved?

I thought the documentation/harvesting process could benefit from the following ones, before we dive deeper into "how? who? when?":</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<h2>What would be useful for me to remember from the time we spend together and learn?</h2>\n<br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<h2>What is useful for us as a community to remember from the 3,5 day that we are going to spend together?</h2>\n<br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<h2>What do we need to share/feed-back and to whom?</h2>\n<br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<h2>What is useful for our longer term learning and what would be useful to share with others / similar networks etc.?</h2>\n<br>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\t<h2>How widely could our learnings serve?</h2>\n<br>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>In this wiki you will find some information (and a little instruction on how the data collection is going to be organised, please read below) about how we\'re going to capture what\'s going to happen in Brussels. Harvesting can happen on the level of creating a record or memory (the purpose of this wiki, mostly) - as well as looking for emerging patterns and meaning (will happen on site, primarily).</p>\n\n<p>I\'m excited to harvest the crops we\'ve been tending to and will water and nurture in the course of the following weeks!</p>\n\n<h3>Possible Roles</h3>\n\n<p>The roles are suggestions. Find your own and preferred way to document - and let us participate in each others learnings! If you have an idea for another role - please share. This is just the beginning and I\'m eager for (and we are dependent on) your input. <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p><strong>*session journalist</strong></p>\n\n<p>(got it, he? You document one or several sessions that you attend. Everyone who couldn\'t come, but is interested in the material, will be a grateful bunny and love you forever.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>*day journalist, who captures the flow and what happened besides the sessions/talks</strong></p>\n\n<p>(This event isn\'t only about what\'s been talked about during the sessions. So much happens in between, and it would be wonderful to have a couple of people who would like to write a little bit about the flow of the day. Yes, it\'s cool to go back to the sessions\' material after some weeks, but it\'s also very valuable to read through the flow again and remember the moments in between. Isn\'t that what un-conferences are about ...?)</p>\n\n<p><strong>*photographer</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>*video journalist</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>*investigative interviewer of someone who caught your interest during the event</strong></p>\n\n<p>Bios of participants will be made available on site. Pick someone and ask them what you\'d like to investigate on further. If you\'re into trying out something new: Pick someone you\'re least likely to talk to, normally.</p>\n\n<p><strong>*seekers for questions, patterns and nuggets\xa0</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Art of Powerful Questions - very worth reading:\xa0<a href="http://www.sparc.bc.ca/the-art-of-powerful-questions">click me!</a></p>\n\n<p>If you\'re in a hurry and just want an idea on the power of good questions:\xa0<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3003945/one-conversational-tool-will-make-you-better-absolutely-everything">just a little something on questions</a>\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>*whatever other way you\'re going to come up with and whatever you feel called to collect\xa0</strong></p>\n\n<p>(I have seen harvesting in form of poems, songs, best dirty jokes from the smokers corners ... whatever you find worth spreading / adding to the information pool / being remembered and carried forth. Remember to have fun and look for what inspires you. If you get bored by what you\'re documenting, you should probably pick another point to look from. Another question that really calls you. Something that iches and wants to be explored. Find your own point to look from and let us participate in what you see.)</p>\n\n<h3>How to collect the harvest?</h3>\n\n<p>1.<strong>\xa0attend LOTE.</strong>\xa0That would help.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. takes notes/record things in whatever format that works for you best</strong>\xa0(written, pictures, video footage ...)</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. upload your harvest in whatever form you prefer:\xa0<a href="/t/about-the-lote5-documentation-category/453">edgeryders.eu/lote5-doc</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>The upside of creating a posting/document and link it:<strong>\xa0</strong>The discussion of the sessions can continue in the very thread, add their gold nuggets etc., so the pool of wisdom (ha, how does that sound?!) can potentially grow.\xa0If you document one of the sessions, please make sure the session title is also part of the post\xa0title.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. document with others in realtime:\xa0<a href="https://lote5.hackpad.com/">lote5.hackpad.com/</a></strong>\xa0(you may need to create an account to see the full list of pads in the lote5 collaction)</p>\n\n<h3>When is this due?</h3>\n\n<p>It can be tough for some people (like me) to juggle being fully present at the event and delivering the outcome asap. So don\'t stress out during LOTE itself. The goal would be to have the material uploaded until approx. 2 weeks after the event.</p>\n\n<h3>Please add yourself to the wiki!</h3>\n\n<p>If you\'d like to document a session (woohoooo!!), please add your name next to the session title. In case more session are being added and aren\'t on the wiki yet, add it! (if the wiki runs out of rows at some point and you don\'t know how to edit, give <a class="mention" href="/u/kaja">@Kaja</a> a shout.)</p>\n\n<p>If you\'d like to document something that is no session, please find a title for it yourself, add it and also write down your name. This is not a binding contract. Play with it and be courageous. Add your shiny selves and dare to share your learnings. Worst case: You fail. Which would be good, especially if you share it, so the rest of us can get a bit of relief from our own fears of fucking things up. You\'d do me a favour, at least. And you\'d earn the courage crown! <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>Thank you for joining the documentation and harvesting team! It would be wonderful if you filled your name in as early as possible, so us documentation and reflection freaks can chill out about this. Thanks! <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p><a

Europe is the place-to-go for several millions of women and men. This will not change\xa0in the next decades. The challenge is to think about this not as a threat, but as an opportunity. That is, to imagine how migration can become a driver of innovation towards a younger, more dynamic, more cosmopolitan and, at the end of the day, more resilient Europe. \xa0\xa0</p>\n\n<p>No one knows whether, and how, this positive perspective could become real. The only wise move to do is to consider this broad view, i.e. the possibility of a new cosmopolitan Europe, as a design-orienting scenario: a shared vision on the basis of which to experiment local solutions, to discuss them and to use them to feed a broad social learning process. And this is what we attempt here.</p>\n\n<p>"Collaborative inclusion" is a reflexive design exercise to explore how collaboration between migrants and residents can strengthen the social fabric. More precisely, we look at <em>what kinds</em> of collaborative services (intended as result-oriented collaborations among different actors) can produce social, cultural, economic value.</p>\n\n<p>Answering this question will lead us to another one: <em>how</em> to conceive and/or evaluate collaborative service capable to produce such multiple value? This reflexive design exercise adopts three simple evaluation criteria. A service is considered "better" when:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Each migrant has more scope to express his/her ideas, and to choose what to do and how.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>He/she is active and uses better his/her sensitivity, skills and knowledge in the service.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\xa0He/she produces more, better results for him/herself, for other migrants and for the whole resident community.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>These three criteria, which come from design for social innovation experiences in different fields of application, are quite simple. We suspect that most services deployed in Europe to dealing with migration fail all three, quite spectacularly.\xa0</p>\n\n<h3>\n\n</h3><p><a name="who"></a>Who should participate\xa0</p>\n\n<p>We only ask that participants do their best be critical, creative and committed.<span>\xa0</span>No specific information or competence on migration issue is required. We believe we all have firsthand experience at coming to terms with migration. Many of us are migrants (especially in Brussels!); the others are part of host communities. We are all citizen experts. Additionally, some of us have extra skills (design) or experiences (hosting newcomers in their homes). We specifically welcome:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>refugees or ex-refugees.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>people who can translate to and from Arabic.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>people who are involved in projects aimed at facilitating the welcome and insertion of migrants and refugees (example: there are many projects in the<a href="https://hackpad.com/Tech-Projects-For-Refugees-hL0DFzrTNAq" rel="nofollow noopener"> Techfugees project directory</a>).</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>designers.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>We already have some participants in all these categories, but the more the better!</p>\n\n<h3>\n\n</h3><p><a name="where"></a>When, where and how to participate</p>\n\n<p>Collaborative inclusion is part of the <a href="/t/welcome-to-lote5/4849">Living On The Edge 5</a> community gathering. It takes place on February 26th 2016 in Brussels, at <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/241459220#map=19/50.83221/4.33805" rel="nofollow noopener">SmartBE</a>.

How can migrants and other resident actors collaborate to improve their quality of the life?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: In the complexity of the present society we can already find promising examples of migrants-residents collaboration: collaborative initiatives demonstrating how the search of migrants\u2019 inclusion can be turned in a collaborative service, and therefore, in the exploration of new ways of living and working.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Methodology</strong>: The exercise is in two steps: (1) to consider and discuss a number of promising examples, and (2) to improve them and/or use them as triggers for brand new proposals.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Specificity</strong>: We build on our previous experience in design for social innovation, and aim to verify its usefulness in creating value for both the migrants and the whole society. This leads us to work in three main directions, that translate into three main criteria for the conception and evaluation of the services the group will come up with:\xa0</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>User-centered approach (as precondition)</strong>: solutions must consider each migrant as a free individual. That is, it must be based on his/her right and concrete possibility to express ideas, and choose what to do and how.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Capability approach (as main design guideline)</strong>: solutions must be based on migrants\u2019 active participation. More precisely, they should enable them to use at best their sensitivity, skills and knowledge.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Multiple-value production (as result to be achieved)</strong>: solutions must achieve some practical and social results for all the involved actors (migrants and residents) and for society as a whole (in terms of physical and social commons improvement).\xa0</li>\n\n</ul><h3>\n\n</h3><p><a name="aims"></a>Aims</p>\n\n<p>The aim of the workshop is not to invent new solutions (it will be impossible to do it in a serious way in this context) but to start form some existing promising practices, to imagine and present ideas and actions to amplify their potentialities.</p>\n\n<p>Where:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Promising practices are initiatives that are already operating in the collaborative inclusion spirit. That is, living examples of how collaboration between migrants and local communities can solve problems and generate values for all (the same migrants and the whole society).</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>To amplify potentialities means to give promising practices visibility and support. That is, (1) to increase their possibility to be positively recognized by larger number of people (among both migrants and residents), and (2) to improve the (social, cultural, normative, technical, and economic) environment so that it could become easier for the given promising practices to consolidate and last in time, and for other similar initiatives to start and flourish.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ideas and actions means everything can be conceived in terms of communication, services, places, events and performances that could give that specific practice, and its produced values more visibility and/or that could produce for that same practice, or for other similar ones, a more supportive environment\xa0</p>\n\n<h3>\n\n</h3><p><a name="structure"></a>Workshop structure</p>\n\n<p>The workshop is organised in three moments:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>10.00\xa0Setting the scene and promising practices presentations</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>11.00 Group work (in 5 parallel groups) (including lunch)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>15.00 Group presentations and discussion</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>16.00 End</li>\n\n</ul><h3>\n\n</h3><p><a name="brief"></a>Working groups brief</p>\n\n<p>A facilitator will help each working group for extra speed, fluidity and fun. Each group will work on one promising case study of a service for refugees and migrants. Given this, each group\xa0outline one or more ideas/actions to amplify its potentialities. The focus can be on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Visibility, to make the values a given promising practice (directly and indirectly) produces more visible and attractive.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Support, to make its environment more favourable, for the same promising practice and for other similar ones.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Expected results</strong> for workgroups are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Each group conceive 2-3 ideas/actions and the communicative artefacts needed to present them. These ideas/actions must be motivated and presented indicating the main involved actors, outlining their organization and their technical and economic viability.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Activities</strong> of working groups activity will be divided into three phases:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1: Understanding and representing</strong> (the case, its actors and its values)</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Outlining the promising practice organization form, focusing on the values it produces (for the migrant and for the local community)</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Identifying the involved actors, focusing on migrants (and creating personas).</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Defining the related journey of experience, focusing on its main touch points</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2: Generating ideas</strong> (on how to give visibility and support to the case)</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>In-depth discussion of the produced values, focusing on their strengths and weakness.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Generation of ideas (for example, each group member indicates an idea. These individual ideas are clustered in groups with similar meanings and discussed by the working group to find the first 2-3 better ones.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Ideas consolidation, with the definition of: main involved actors, outlining their organization and their technical and economic viability.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 3: Making visible</strong> (producing communicative artefacts to present the group results)</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Group members prepare the 2-3 ideas/actions presentation, considering the need of a very short, 5\u2019 presentation. \xa0\xa0</li>\n\n</ul><h3>\n\n</h3><p><a name="PreWorkshop"></a>Before the workshop</p>\n\n<p>Each participant is invited:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>to search for promising case and select, at least, one example that, in his/her view, is (totally or at least partly) coherent with the three previously indicated criteria of conception and evaluation.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>to write a short presentation of the selected example (name, place, main promoters, goals and values produced for the migrants and for the society), add a photo and edit the whole in an A4 format (only one sheet).

They seek advice, medical help and moral support from each other. They exchange knowledge and share resources. They meet, interact, and work together.\xa0And, of course, no human can live well if he or she disconnects from the fabric of society at large (in recent times, care also happened in big bureaucracies, but that approach has issues. Here we look for something better).</p>\n\n<p><strong>We think that this ceaseless exchange is collective intelligence at work</strong>.\xa0Network analysis is a useful tool to understand this process, and perhaps find ways to improve upon it. Thinking in networks\xa0is a great way to generate fresh, relevant questions.\xa0How do you know your network is going in the right direction? What is a \u201cdirection\u201d in this context? Is everyone following the same path? Do people group into sub-communities? What are the focus of these (sub) communities?\xa0</p>\n\n<h3>What</h3>\n\n<p><strong>We come together to find out how networked humans can better take care of each other.</strong>\xa0</p>\n\n<p>To do this, we study result-oriented conversations. Conversations are networks: people are its nodes, and the exchanges are its links. It you don\'t believe us,\xa0<a href="/sites/all/modules/contrib/edgesense/static/dashboard.html">click here</a> to explore the Edgeryders conversation network (allow a few seconds for the data to download). But conversations are networks also in another sense: each exchange contains some concepts. Example of concepts useful in care are: well-being, syringe, diabethes, fitness, prosthetics, etc. We can represent concept in a conversation as a network. Concepts themselves are its nodes; two concepts are linked if\xa0they are in the same exchange.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Person-to-person conversation networks tell us who is talking to whom</strong>. Are there individuals who act as "hubs"? Why? Can we use hubs to improve the process, for example asking them to spread important knowledge?\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Concept-to-concept conversation networks tell us how the different concepts connect\xa0to each other</strong>. Are there surprises? Do apparently unrelated concepts tend to come up in the same exchanges? Anomalies might mean something interesting is going on. In fact, spotting anomalies is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak#John_Snow_investigation">John Snow\xa0invented epidemiology in 1854</a>.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>The fascinating part is this: <strong>by looking at the network, we can extract information that no individual in the network has</strong>. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Collective intelligence!\xa0</p>\n\n<h3>How</h3>\n\n<p><strong>We look at conversation data</strong> taken from Edgeryders and\xa0build them into a network. We use open source software for network analysis. We then visualize\xa0and\xa0interrogate the network to see what we can learn. Our final aim is to prototype methodologies for extracting collective intelligent outcomes from conversations.</p>\n\n<p>One great output from the workshop would be to unleash our imagination, and\xa0<strong>specify design &amp; requirements</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>What views works best?</strong> It\'ll be useful to build it as a mockup if we do not already have it -- <em>use color pens, paper, clips, cardboard and build it into a mock-up!</em>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>For what tasks? </strong>Do we need to move things around? Pile them up to trigger comparison of things on-the-fly? Lasso an item to trigger some computation? -- <em>use post-it notes, cut and paste pieces of paper, draw arrows to turn tasks into real actions (on a screen!).</em>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Using what ingredient (data)?</strong> What should we feed the system with to accomplish these analytical tasks? <em>-- write them down, cut &amp; paste, associate them with specific tasks, embed them into views.</em>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The workshop is a unique opportunity to have a design participatory workshop -- we want it to be a source of inspiration to <strong>design and build the next generation EdgeSense dashboard!</strong></p>\n\n<h3>\n\n</h3><p><strong>Who</strong> should come</p>\n\n<p>Masters of Networks is open to all, and especially friendly to beginners. Patients, network scientists, doctors, hackers and so on all have something to contribute. But in the end\xa0we are all experts in this domain. We all\xa0give and receive care\xa0in the course of our lives, and all humans are expert conversationalists. \xa0There\'s an extra bonus for beginners: networks are easy to visualize. And when you visualize them, as we will, they are\xa0often beautiful and intuitive.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Trust us. We have done this before (check out <a href="https://youtu.be/2-9z0i5fuvE">the video above</a>).</p>\n\n<h3>Data</h3>\n\n<p>We have a dataset drawn from a large conversation that took place on the Edgeryders platform in 2014. It consists of 161 posts and 910 comments, authored by 128 different people. All posts and comments have been annotated by a professional ethnographer. This leaves us with an ontology of relevant concepts: we can use it to build the network.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>That\xa0conversation was not about care. We will need to be clever, and use different data to figure out a methodology to apply to a future conversation about care.\xa0</p>\n\n<h3>Agenda and challenges</h3>\n\n<p>The agenda is simple:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>We will spend the first hour and a half explaining how the data were formed, harvested and converted into a network. We will explore the network together using a software called <a href="http://detangler.labri.fr:31497">Detangler</a>, brainchild of the wonderful <a href="/u/brenoust"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/brenoust">@brenoust</a>. Detangler is highly intuitive: we can use it to manipulate network without knowing\xa0<em>any</em>\xa0network math at all.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Then, we\'ll <strong>hack</strong>.\xa0We can explore the data in many directions. Depending on how many we are, we can split into groups that look at different things. We see at least three possibilities:</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Visualization challenge</strong>. Create informative and beautiful visualizations starting from our data. Skills needed: design, dataviz, netviz. <em>Coordinator: <a class="mention" href="/u/melancon">@melancon</a> (you can call me Guy)</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\u200bIts not only about creativity and beauty, it\'s about interactivity -- a map seen as a malleable object so you can squirk information out of it.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>It\'s also about being able to specify graphical design from the tasks you\'d need to conduct on the data and its representation on the screen.\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>How is a node-link view useful? How would you intuitively like to manipulate, filter or change it at will when exploring it?</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Would you feel you need to synchronize the view with a bar chart on some statistics? A scatterplot to figure out if things correlate?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p></p>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Interpretation challenge.</strong> How many conclusions and hypotheses can we "squeeze" from the data? Skills needed: social research, ethnography, network science. <em>Coordinator: <a class="mention" href="/u/noemi">@Noemi</a>?</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Interpretation is at the core of the process. You play with data, you map it, and iteratively build hypothesis. In the end, you dream you would have provable claims.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src="/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b15e2e2aebc4c021f0f11ebe8616326825abbad7.png" width="408" height="274"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Quality challenge</strong>. Can we think of simple criteria to filter the data for the highest-quality content only (eg: only posts with a minimum number of comments, or of minimum length)? Does the filtering change the results? <em>Coordination: <a class="mention" href="/u/alberto">@Alberto</a></em></p>\n\n<p>And more. But we insist that every group has a coordinator, who takes responsibility for driving it, sharing the relevant material (examples: software libraries, notes for participants, pseudo code...). If we only have two coordinators, we\'ll only have two groups. If you think you can lead a group, get in touch with us!</p>\n\n<h3>Tentative schedule</h3><ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>9h30 - 11h - <a class="mention" href="/u/alberto">@Alberto</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/melancon">@melancon</a> (<a class="mention" href="/u/hazem">@Hazem</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/noemi">@Noemi</a>) give a start by drawing the overall picture, following the famous adagio "A picture is worth a thousand words".</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>11h - 12h30 Teams give it a first shot\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The viz team will play a game building their ideal visual dashboard using pen and paper, cardboard -- explaining why these features may turn to be essential when exploring or analyzing network data.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The interpretation team output is critical: the directions they will provide has decisive impact on how data will be used, massaged and turned into visual representations.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>The qualitative team plays a similar role, feeding the intepretation team with high quality content -- their recommendations will make even greater sense if we can link them with paths of interpretation.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p></p>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>12h30 - 14h Feed your brain with proteins and glucids.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>14h - 16h\xa0Teams go back to work and build a proof-of-concept of the ideas /hypothesis they came up with in the morning session.\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Cross-fertilization of ideas with the other teams is encouraged.

Ethnography is a qualitative method to analyze texts and attach tags to the texts that represent what the text says. The tags have to be standardized, so different researchers can be consistent in the use.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In the past ethnographic researches where limited because it was costly to gather the texts via interviews and transcripts. They are not statistically representative.</p>\n\n<p>Edgeryders supports in-platform etnographic tagging. Of course, most content in Edgeryders is NOT ethnographically tagged: ethnography is expensive, and we only do it as part of contracts in which ethnography is used to lift collective expert advice from the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Online the texts are already written, so they don\'t need to be transcribed, and the ethnographers\' codes can be kept together with the texts.</p>\n\n<p>These tags are composed of super-classes (f.i. "Topic" or "Place") and they can be nested, and for each super-class you can entry different values (f.i. "Charity" or "Cairo").</p>\n\n<p>An example: the users writes "Our task will be to explore how we may then model interaction beween users," -&gt; the ethnographer attaches the tag "interaction" . This tag is added in the html code of the platform, directly linked to the original text.</p>\n\n<p>When this happens, a semantic layer is added to Edgeryders content. \xa0We can add semantics to the social network representation of the Edgeryders conversation: not just "who is talking to whom", but, adding semantics, "who is talking to whom about what".</p>\n\n<h3>Edgeryders data</h3>\n\n<p>On Edgeryders, the ethnographic data are linked to other kind of data, like the profile of the users (age, location etc), the circumstances surrounding the text. We have these ethnographer-coded data only for a specific conversation (because we had financing to gather it). We want to do this again in Open Care.</p>\n\n<p>Of course you do not have all the information about the context of a conversation, for instance you don\'t know what happened besides the online platform. We will still miss a lot, and make misinterpretations.</p>\n\n<p>Question (Ezio Manzini): what is the object that you are observing? Is it a conversation on Open Care or is it a conversation on Open Care in the context of the Edgeryders platform, and such and such.</p>\n\n<p>A problem about "large scale conversations": a large number of users does not imply that many people will participate in the conversation. In the course of a EU project called CATALYST we learned that almost no threads have more than 10 participants, even in "large communities" like Loomio, with 10K users.</p>\n\n<p>We should rephrase the question says Ezio, one that is more precisely the question that can be answered by this tool. Yes, but we need to use the tool to discover the question. You have some questions and in the process you will discover more questions.</p>\n\n<h3>Network</h3>\n\n<p>We have users who initiate posts and reply to posts with comments. We have ethnographers who will tag some of the texts. We want to discover how people interact and what the conversations will be about.</p>\n\n<p>When you click</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>"user to user" in Tulip you actually see the people who interact (have a conversation).\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>user to comments: which comments they made</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>"post to groups" you see the posts that have been added in the group.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>user to tags tells you which users are talking about a tag - if you believe in collective intelligence you need more than this because you still don\'t know if these users are talking to each other -&gt; you want to see the conversations between the users that contain this tag, that is when the semantic is important</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>we also want to link concepts to other concepts</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here you an see if a tag was interesting and if it was important. When people share something or comment is a different thing. Relevance can become important as well. (This previous has to do with sentiment analysis) But it is not the core of what we want to do in Open Care. It can be important to single out the people who talk about a topic.</p>\n\n<p>idealistic idea of human interaction. Deep conversation, rather than big data.</p>\n\n<p>User-to-tags networks are not easy to interpret. Guy and Benjamin Renoust introduced semantic edges show me only the edges that include "real action" as tag. another idea is visualising two networks, one of people to people and one of tags to tags. if you \'lasso" a topic you sese the network of people who talked about it. if you lasso two topics you see the people who talked about either (but you can switch view and see who talked about both). if the people have been talking to each other about the tag then the edge becomes red as well, otherwise only the node. If you select a user you can see the tags he\'s been talking about.</p>\n\n<p>In this version of the network, people are connected if one of them reacts to the other\'s post of comment. If someone reacts to a comment to somebody\'s else\'s post, then he\'ll be connected to the author of the comment but not to the author of the post. It is possible with these data to make different choices.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Start from a tag, say "open-source software" and</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>see if the people talking about it are also talking to each other. If so, we can speak of \xa0an emergent group of specialists, emergent because it "happened", nobody assigned them to do that. The word "group" is critical here: if people were just speaking about open source software in isolation, they could be in total disagreement and not even know about it, but if they are talking to each other about open source software there can be a convergence going on, like when Wikipedians weed out mistakes in the encyclopedia\'s articles.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>lasso those guys and see what else they are also talking about, and get an indicative map of how this emergent group of experts sees the topic.\xa0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The present data are "post-mortem" of the conversation. The ideal situation is to be able to analyze the conversation with this tool almost "real-time", let\'s say on a daily basis. This, however, has the problem that ethnographic research does not really work that way: ethnographers find it easier to maintain consistency if they work in batch.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Guy: The tool could influence people to do more if it was available. It can be a user tool, besides a research tool. Alberto: However the Edgesense tool was made available to the community, and there do not seem to be that many people looking at it.</p>\n\n<h3>Edgesense</h3>\n\n<p><a href="https://edgeryders.eu/sites/all/modules/contrib/edgesense/static/dashboard.html" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://edgeryders.eu/sites/all/modules/contrib/edgesense/static/dashboard.html</a></p>\n\n<p>The color coding are the nodes that are more connected to each other that to other members of the group. If you are very active you have "your own" group. For instance Noemi, her group is not exactly a star but very central.</p>\n\n<p>The links are directional: two nodes can be linked by two curved lines, one from node a to node b, the other in the opposite direction.</p>\n\n<p>You \xa0can show by degree (number of connections), select only the edges that link to and from the moderators. You can also hide them and see that the network is still holding. Some people fall out, but the giant component remains.</p>\n\n<h3>OpenCare narrative</h3>\n\n<p>This example also helps clarify Ezio\'s question above. What is the question that this network representation can answer? The sociology of the network. It helps manage the group. The network we saw on Tulip, it might be worth spending some time to find a bridge between what the tool can do, and the general question "what is open care". IN which ways can it be helpful?</p>\n\n<p>This network is updated real-time. What would be a proper time frame for a semantic coding? The coding needs some consistency. So the ethnographer will say you make a conversation and then we tag it. The project on open care does not include a real-time semantic coding. That is a lot of work and would be a big addition to the project, needing its own financing.</p>\n\n<p>Keywords. Quality tracking. Network authoritativeness. You could use the latter to filter what the ethnographer has to code, so the method becomes scalable. Not by using robots (not working with ethnography) but because you use network math to filter the content.</p>\n\n<p>Author generated tags can work if implemented with auto-prompting and proper incentives, Harry Halpin has published on this about Delicious. Ethnography would not agree, Alberto believes., we can\'t trust it, although we can try it. But the added values is in small numbers, because then it can be used by smaller communities as well.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Ezio: the tool also needs to help develop some intervention. For instance spotting the emergent group of experts could be a useful intervention for the Comune di Milano. We need to develop a narrative like that about the tool we saw in Tulip for Open Care. Alberto believes he has a narrative, a strong hypothesis. Collective intelligence. Small scale collective intelligence. Problems are local, resources are local. So if we have a permanent think-tank on a platform and a cheap way to harvest from it, then we have a tool for a local community to use. You can identify the emergent groups of experts on specific topics and look at them rather than having to make a large scale study.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Instead of going up, going big I\'m trying to go down, go deep, focus on a small group of people, without drawing a line around them (because then you\'d loose the openness).</p>\n\n<p>Ezio: I\'ve never posted. It would be different if someone would ask around if they have something to say. Now I am here and I talk to people, I feel committed. But now I understand that we have to write because if we talk now we cannot register what we say. Alberto: This is the open. You commit to make the things you said available to people you did never even meet.</p>\n\n<p>Ezio: we are collectively writing a document. You should know who the contributors are. At a certain point, you can say this is the book we wrote and these people wrote. The way this book was written has made it possible to work in a certain way. Alberto: yes, in the end, the ethnographic report will say we had these number of people and...\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Ezio: if I want to participate I have to write and I have to be very attentive. Alberto: you can also choose to be a marginal author, just have a role along the side. And you still are a coauthor. Also the cook who made the lunch at the Lote5 meeting mattered in the making of the book.</p>\n\n<p>Ezio: co-design process. These tools could be part of the solution. We are now a network and there could then be a network of nurses doctors etc. This discussion can in a similar way happen among care-givers? Costantino: the conversation will not be the result of this group, but of a larger group. But the network of care-givers might be not committed, skilled, or motivated to use an online tool.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>As an example it is possible to use the results of the ethnographic study to feed the discussion at the Comune di Milano. Alberto: Ideally you bridge across. Costantino: this is the hard part. If the discussion is not well documented and published in the coming days, then the online community will miss it. And viceversa. So the tricky part is right here. How can we bring them across each other. In terms of artifact, in terms of codesign, our committment is to at least make transparent what are the needs of the people that we are meeting, how are the codesign sessions organised. Upload the design of a artifact online so that other people can contribute. Many levels: design, conversation... We are going far beyojnd ER as it was right now. We are not only creating a book or a report we are also committed to create real prototypes. So we need to go one step forward, so that we have the tools to manage not only the online conversation but also the other levels. But the online conversation is key to all this.</p>\n\n<p>Alberto: we are not trying to invent a new methodology, just trying to do it well. The online community is key because of permanency, findability, linkability...</p>\n\n<p>A discussion about Wikipedia, the major difficulty is that we do not own that platform so we can\'t control. I\'m in a village and need info, i go to wikipedia, and ER might use that.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>You can\'t brief too much in terms of what will emerge in terms of design.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>People in Milano have clear problems: Where do I leave my kids. You try to solve, and the solutions kind of work and we try to use this process to make it better.</p>\n\n<p>The process that we are following here is not the prototype. The prototype we talk about is some care solution. Online the local problem in Milano goes global and someone from France can intervene in the conversation. The prototyping part is in Milan, but care issues are similar all over the world.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In the Spot the Future project we saw the the international interaction was very valuable. The capability of transferring the knowledge by solutions found abroad to other context is exactly the point that makes it possible to finding new solutions.</p>\n\n<h2>Afternoon session</h2>\n\n<p>Two groups: quality of data and Wikipedia data</p>\n\n<h3>Quality of data session</h3>\n\n<p>We used Tulip and Detangler to explore a semantic network dataset similar to the one that will be used for Open Care. We filter our data according to two proxies for quality:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>post/comment length as quality: discard all posts and comments under, say, 100 characters. This would only keep thoughtful contribution.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>user pagerank as quality: pagerank or other eigenvector centrality measures are often associated to correlate to authoritativeness. So, we can reduce the network to the contributions made by the highest-ranking individuals.\xa0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The hypothesis is that the reduced semantic social networks would not be much different from the non-reduced ones. If that is confirmed, the methodology is scalable: if you get a ton of content, just filter it for quality, and work only on the top-quality 15%.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>We walked through the exercise and found that our reducing code works. However, we found inconsistencies in the data (many comments and posts with apparently no text \u2013 though, when we checked them on the Edgeryders platform, of course the text was there!). We do not feel confident to draw any conclusion. The group resolved to redo the exercise starting from a fresh extraction. Guy Melan\xe7on is taking the lead for this.\xa0</p>\n\n<h3>Wikipedia session</h3>\n\n<p>We made a sketch of a graphic representation of the medical articles on wikipedia in all languages. The larger the node, the more often a page has been visited and links represent the hyperlinks between pages. We use this representation to explore the data and look at emerging patterns. For instance we will compare the structure of the networks in the different language to see if there might be cultural or geographical properties that can lead to interesting research questions.</p>\n\n<p>The code for the Wikipedia session can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/spaghetti-open-data/visualizing-self-diagnosis">https://github.com/spaghetti-open-data/visualizing-self-diagnosis</a></p>', u'post_id': 5403, u'user_id': 4, u'timestamp': u'2016-03-03 14:07:54', u'title': u'Documentation | MASTERS OF NETWORKS: NETWORKS OF CARE'}, {u'content': u'<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a href="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhippycommune.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F04%2Fmeeting-on-the-gate-porch.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" class="lightbox" title="proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhippycommune.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F04%2Fmeeting-on-the-gate-porch.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*"><img alt src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhippycommune.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F04%2Fmeeting-on-the-gate-porch.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" width="690" height="471"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhippycommune.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F04%2Fmeeting-on-the-gate-porch.jpg&amp;amp;container=blogger&amp;amp;gadget=a&amp;amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*</span><span class="informations">760x519</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>In any community, conflict is inevitable.\xa0</strong>It can be destructive or it can be an opportunity.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>How a group, and the individuals in it, deal with conflict is often the difference between the kind of breakthroughs that make a community stronger or the kind of meltdowns that turn an endeavor into a \u201clate great.\u201d\xa0In this session we\u2019ll explore <strong>how to cope with meltdowns to optimize opportunities and avoid self-destruction.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>This Keynote will be held by\xa0<a href="/u/johncoate">John Coate</a>, an original member of the Farm community (Wikipedia), the largest and most successful hippy commune ever (still in existence, and doing great, though it is now a cooperative rather than a collective).

What do [ OpenCarers or Names of Interviewees] have in common?</h2>\n\n<p><strong><span>Voice over: </span></strong><span>They see a number of trends which together form future we are ill-equipped to deal with.</span><strong><span> </span></strong>For most of humanity\'s history, care services \u2013 which today we call health and social care \u2013 were provided by communities: family members, friends and neighbours would check on each other to make sure everyone was fine, keep an eye on each other\'s children or elderly parents, even administer simple medical treatments. Starting from the second half of the 20th century, developed countries switched to systems where the care providers were professionals, working for the government and modern corporations.</p>\n\n<p>This new solution has achieved brilliant results, based on the deployment of scientific knowledge and technology. However, over the past 20 years it has come under growing strain:</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Trend 1:</strong> the demand for professional care (health care, social care, daycare for children, care for elderly people\u2026) seems limitless, but the resources our economies allocate to it clearly are not.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Trend 2:</strong> many attempts to rationalise the system and squeeze some extra productivity out of it seems to dehumanise people in need of care, who get treated as batches in a manufacturing process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Trend 3:</strong> Privacy and security concerns in the age of ubiquotous connectivity. Increasingly intimate data generated about us and shared beyond our control, or that of the institutions meant to protect our rights.</p>\n\n<p>Animation: current situations --- current ways of doing things-----&gt; current (negative) futures.</p>\n\n<h2>3. They are also part of a growing community of people figuring out how to build a health and social care system that is safe, accessible, open and participatory.</h2>\n\n<p>What if we could come up with a system that combines the access to modern science and technology of state- and private sector-provided care to the low overhead and human touch of community-provided care? This is what they, and thousands of others are setting out to do.</p>\n\n<h2>4. What will come out of it?</h2>\n\n<p>New knowledge, prototypes and economic models.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Ok great, so how will this work and how can you be a part of it?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Animation: </strong>current situation ---OpenCare-----&gt; closer to ideal futures via these steps (on a staircase):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Outreach and exchange of experiences </p></li>\n<li><p>Collaborative sense making </p></li>\n<li><p>Narrative building </p></li>\n<li><p>Prototyping and testing </p></li>\n<li><p>Prizes  6. Exhibition and Summit</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Voice over</strong> (describing each step of staircase):</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Outreach and exchange of experiences: </strong>It all starts with an invitation for you and others around the world to share personal experiences, observations and examples on the challenge topic. You will share stories of individuals and groups who are building alternative alternatives to existing health-or social care, as well as of others whose attempts were frustrated. The purpose of this is to build a shared repository of stories, each one embedding strategies for improving health- and social care. Some will resonate more than others with participants, and that will signal to the community that a grain of truth has been found. Collectively, we will build knowledge about new approaches towards health- and social care. </em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Collaborative sense making:</strong> Once the the goals of OpenCarers, a range of possible strategies towards them and the obstacles in the way are reasonably clear, the project enters a new phase of (wiki-style) collaborative writing of the OpenCare fund mission and guidelines. This phase links OpenCare stories to the social, economic, political and legal context in which they happen: were they enabled by something in particular? Were they hindered by it? What change in could have made the alternative happen, or happen more successfully? By asking and tentatively answering these kinds of question, participants in the process will build shared knowledge and goals. This strategy ensures that both are firmly grounded in real-life, first-person experiences.</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Project Narrative and calls to action: </strong>We collaboratively synthesise the results of our sense making into a narrative structure for OpenCare, that is going to set the scene for our interactions with one another. This includes co-designing a fair social contract and ethical guidelines for members. It also includes defining role structures (for example: participants can register as \u201ctrailblazers\u201d sharing stories or \u201cmentors\u201d that help making sense of it), motivational engines (for example: badges, karma points or other forms of recognition for active users), strategic partnerships, style and aesthetics.</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Prototyping and testing: </strong>t.b.d</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Prizes: </strong>t.b.d</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Exhibition and Summit: #lote 6 takes place in September 2017, in Milan.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Voice over and text:</strong> To learn more about OpenCare and how you can be a part of it, go to <a href="http://www.opencare.cc">www.opencare.cc</a> or write to community@edgerders.eu</p>\n\n<hr><h2>Interview Questions: </h2>\n\n<p>Need to be revosed to give us the right material for script above!</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>What is your understanding of what OpenCare is - why should your audience care about it? </li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>What will you be exploring/doing in the project- how will you be working? </li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>What activities you will be running - who do you want to get involved and why? </li>\n\n</ul>', u'post_id': 5374, u'user_id': 8, u'timestamp': u'2016-02-24 00:06:24', u'title': u'Film/Video Planning'}, {u'content': u'<h2>OpenCare Research workspace</h2>\n\n<p>You can get an inside view of the OpenCare European funded project (2016-2017).

This mean blurring the distinction between researchers, designers, caregivers and care receivers. \xa0</p>\n\n<p>Consistently with this vision, <strong>the Op3nCare consortium has decided to make its own meetings open for anyone interested to participate</strong>. The ethos is <strong>"one day of talking, one day of doing"</strong>: for every day spent on administration issues, we are setting aside another day to do hands-on stuff like design workshops, network data analysis, or hardware hacking, with doors thrown wide open. Additionally, we\xa0intend to use our meetings to partner up with, and contribute to, events organised by existing communities already working on care, collective intelligence, open source hardware and software hacking.\xa0We are aware that this marks a clean break with the tradition of closed-doors consortium meetings in European-funded research, even for projects that publish their results with open licenses, and that we are venturing in uncharted territory. But then again, that\'s why they call it "research".</p>\n\n<h2>2016</h2><h3>FEBRUARY</h3>\n\n<p><strong>26/2, Brussels, 09:00 -10:00\xa0|\xa0</strong><a href="/t/how-to-cope-with-meltdown-in-communities/5106">How to cope with meltdowns in communities</a>,\xa0Keynote by John Coate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>26/2, Brussels, 09:30 -16:15 |\xa0</strong><a href="/en/opencare/let-s-co-create-our-own-welfare-how-to-design-collaborative">Collaborative inclusion.\xa0How migrants-residents collaboration can produce social values.

Especially when it involves introducing your intended audience to some new concept or way of doing things, this can be very difficult.</p>\n\n<p>So we started looking at previous efforts to do this. We started by analysing our experiences of having worked with communication for over 10 years. Then we explored how much respected storytellers such as George Lucas and my first mentor, award winning Swedish Director Roy Andersson, go about building engaging stories.</p>\n\n<p>It was so much fun that Angelo has decided join me in leading this workshop.\xa0<span>Later today Angelo and I are meeting again. One of the topics we will be discussing is how to use myths and archetypes in effective storytelling for engagement.\xa0An interesting aspect for a transnational community is which myths and narratives are culturally specific and which ones seem to resonate with everyone. It taps into something which I think is very relevant to the design of the OpenCare engagement process. Bear with me as I try to articulate what is no more than\xa0an early intuition...</span></p>\n\n<p>At the turn of this year\xa0I had a brief exchange with\xa0Evan Roth, one of the early movers in net art and fellow activist. Like many others who grew up on the Internet and who have been fighting against the erosion of civil liberties, he was heartbroken and disenchanted after\xa0the Snowden revelations. A kind of collective depression was tangible in the scene, a lot of people for whom this was the first experience of engaging with mainstream politics just dropped out.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Others have been engaging\xa0with the significant challenge of making the techno-social debate accessible, and engaging, to people outside the tech scene and Brussels bubble. This is sorely needed. Kirsten Fielder,\xa0Julia Reda, Walter Van Holst, our own Erik Lakomaa\xa0(all coming to #lote5) and Amelia Andersdotter have\xa0first-hand experiences\xa0of the difficulties involved.<em>\xa0Amelia in particular has been very active in the debate around data security and patient privacy in Sweden.</em></p>\n\n<p>Evan\'s talk at #32c3 is a poetic description of how he tried to make this overwhelming, abstract infrastructure something with which he could engage as an artist (\xa01hr video).\xa0Julian Oliver\'s creative practice comes at things more from a critical engineering perspective: he has built\xa0functional objects which both critique and circumvent the offending practices or technologies e.g\xa0<a href="http://transparencygrenade.com/">http://transparencygrenade.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Those of us working on OpenCare will be facing the similar challenge\xa0of making\xa0difficult (or\xa0abstract) topics/debates and insights\xa0more accessible. Both to\xa0people who are curious, but need a "soft" way into the conversations...as well as\xa0to community members, practitioners and relevant decision-makers e.g legislators. So I thought it<span>\xa0might be interesting to engage product designers to make some of the more difficult or abstract topics/debates "easier" to approach through the lens of critical design (as an example see\xa0</span><a href="http://www.backslash.cc/"></a><a href="http://www.backslash.cc/">http://www.backslash.cc/</a>)<span>. Maybe even produce an exhibition at the final event taking place in Milan. This could fit into the prototyping phase of the project. Or it could be a separate parallel strand. Prof. Susanne Stauch and myself have been discussing this in the context of a product design course we will be holding at </span><span>Berlin University of the Arts\xa0</span><span>UDK</span></p>', u'post_id': 5344, u'user_id': 8, u'timestamp': u'2016-02-20 08:37:11', u'title': u'Narratives of Care: Reflections ahead of the workshop and OpenCare project design'}, {u'content': u'<p>OpenCare is an EU funded program made up of three things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\tA PLATFORM where people can share stories, ideas and insights and make new connections;</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>A diverse and distributed COMMUNITY or network of individuals and groups, mainly in Europe but including the whole world, exploring alternative, more long-term sustainable solutions to healthcare;</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>A PROCESS that brings people together from this community to share, inspire, connect and collaborate.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The aim is to bring together people, virtually or physically, to gather and share stories, ideas and insights.

And since someone has to start ... here we go.</h3>\n\n<p>Failure. Success. Wow, what a wide and rich topic.</p>\n\n<p>My guess is, since you\'re about to spend 3,5 days of your life in this area of inquiry, it touched something. You might be as intrigued as me, because something wants to be explored on an intellectual or emotional, collective or personal level. What we apparently share is an interest for failure (success?) and I assume that we also share a common interest in "let\'s make more sense of this!". I might as well be wrong, and that\'s exactly what I\'m trying to find out.</p>\n\n<p>So, would you please let me know</p>\n\n<h2>Why are you coming to Brussels?</h2>\n\n<p>I can tell you my "why". If you\'re challenged by emotional content, leave this page NOW. Then better don\'t read, just reply <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Don\'t tell me I didn\'t warn you.</p>\n\n<p>I\'m very excited to meet you all soon, but what the "why" brought up for me, hasn\'t been an easy ride so far. As soon as I stepped into the topic of failure, my relationship to it got a lot clearer and it was not always pretty to face. I had not been aware how much of a chicken I was, how eager I was to avoid failing (or what I perceived as such).</p>\n\n<p>One example: I teach a very efficient self-help method to release stress and other emotional baggage. Some years ago, I was asked by the manager of our local branch of a huge swedish clothing company to coach their team, so they could handle the daily stress in the store better. I was over the moon - and dead shit scared. Too scared. GODDAMNIT!!</p>\n\n<p>When reflecting now on the topic of success vs. failure, I realized: This thing called failure, that many of us fear, but to a different degree, is what has kept me from doing lots of things in the past. Wasn\'t this one of my "biggest" failures so far: letting the fear of it take control? I believe so.</p>\n\n<p>This is what brings me to Brussels. I want to de-demonize the "F", address it more directly and with others instead of within my isolated brain. Talk about it. Listening deeply to others and share the humanness behind the story of failure/success, find the questions that open up new spaces, look at the assumptions we hold individually and collectively and mold this thing called "failure" into another form. Rewrite the story of success and make more peace with this perceived threat. In the end, it\'s my decision which story I live in, what failure means to me and how I let the meaning I give it affect my life.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s why I\'m coming. Partly. It was, what caught my attention. Now I\'m really happy that other topics I care about are being touched: Care, for example. I\'m very interested in the topic of how to unfail "care", since I work in this area, and I\'m not on the edge, but far far off it. And the 3. "why" is that I want to have a blast with all of you <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>\n\n<p>And why are you coming? <img src="//edgeryders.eu/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> In case you think you gotta soul strip now, too: naah!

We dream of a welfare built and delivered by communities, alongside the state and the market. We all, at some point in our life, give and receive care. We are all citizen experts, with firsthand knowledge. The question is: how do we access that knowledge and turn it into action?</p>\n\n<p>We asked Ezio Manzini, perhaps the world\'s most senior academic designer for social innovation, to mount a workshop that does just that. Everyone is welcome. People who attend will use their experience of care to imagine and prototype ways that existing services could be improved. We decided to focus on services to refugees and migrants: we know several and feel for them, and there is a lot \xa0of room for improvement.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>A beautiful thing happened: people got in touch with us offering to help. We ended up with a dream team of designers: <a href="/u/yara_al_adib"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/yara_al_adib">@Yara_Al_Adib</a>, <a href="/u/mousab_alshikh"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/mousab_alshikh">@Mousab_Alshikh</a>, <a href="/u/rand_abu_fakher"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/rand_abu_fakher">@Rand_Abu_Fakher</a>, <a href="/u/orwa_isaac"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/orwa_isaac">@Orwa_Isaac</a>, <a href="/u/vishall_jankie"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/vishall_jankie">@Vishall_Jankie</a>,\xa0<a href="/u/stefanos_monastiridi"><span class="mention">@Stefanos_Monastiridis</span></a>\xa0and <a href="/u/gido_van_den_ende"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/gido_van_den_ende">@Gido_Van_Den_Ende</a>. Four of them are from Syria, arrived as refugees; three are still in the process of obtaining refugee status. A lot of work is going on behind the scenes; and\xa0<a href="http://namahn.com/">Namahn</a>, one of Belgium\'s leading design agencies, is strongly supporting the effort. We can promise a very, very good workshop.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Ezio and the team are adamant: no reinventing the wheel. We want to start from <em>existing</em> services, and look for ways that smart communities could improve them. We are in contact with several people who are running services and initiatives targeted at helping these newcomers (thanks Yara!), but we could use a few more (we\'ll split into working groups). So, here\'s how you can help:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>If you are involved in a project targeted at migrants or refugees, consider joining us as a case study. We will be respectful and absolutely not imply that you are doing things wrong. It\'s about learning, not judging. Just get in touch with me, or anyone from the team.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>If you know one of these project, consider being its ambassador at the workshop. Talk to them, get information, so that you are in a position to represent it.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>You can also participate simply as yourself, with no particular project to represent. There are still some places left.\xa0</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>The workshop is free, but registration is required. Go <a href="/t/collaborative-inclusion-how-migrants-residents-collaboration-can-produce-social-values-a-reflexive-design-exercise/5163">here</a> to register.

Out of this will emerge new ideas, new solutions and new connections that benefit all.\xa0Our challenges, projects, and programs are modeled on Edgeryders collective intelligence methodology.

Many of us have a hard time keeping track of everything. This is a general update on where we are; what we learned; what we expect to be doing next; and how you can be involved in it. Warning: it\'s quite long, about 2,600 words. Expect about 10 minutes reading time. Here we go! \xa0</p>\n\n<h3>What we have done</h3>\n\n<p>Let\'s set the start of the latest work cycle at November 1st 2014. During the previous summer we had concluded the <a href="/t/spot-the-future-final-reports-delivered-ish-linkedin-recommendations-available/3435">Spot the Future</a> project. In October the Italian city of Matera, home of the first unMonastery and one of our key partners, <a href="/t/8-moves-that-worked-for-matera-to-win-the-european-capital-of-culture-2019-title/3959">was crowned European Capital of Culture 2019</a>. In late October we returned to Matera for Living On The Edge 4. We allowed ourselves a small celebration and started looking around for what was next. And that turned out to be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Developing a presence in the European Capitals Of Culture scene</strong>. It just made sense. Edgeryders had made a big, acknowledged contribution to the Matera success story. Some people in the community are artists, and many more care about culture. By being global, we are well positioned to help candidate cities to position their bids on the European scene. There are two or three ECOC competitions every year. And the most compelling argument of all: in this space, we could work with Robert "Bob" Palmer. Bob is Europe\'s most senior cultural policy expert. We all stand to learn much from him. So we built something we are calling the Edgeryders Culture Team. Its first post-Matera success was <a href="/edgeryders.eu/en/spot-the-future-bucharest">getting hired by another candidate city, Bucharest</a>. The city\'s bid earned it the inclusion in the shortlist of candidate ECOCs still in the race for 2021.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Getting better at helping smart, resilient civic processes to grow</strong>. We <a href="/t/future-makers-nepal/598">set up shop in Kathmandu, Nepal</a>, and joined in the grassroots relief effort after the 2015 earthquake. \xa0Matthias and Natalia, who led the effort, ended up working side by side with incredible grassroots groups. Many of these reach deep into rural Nepal, where neither government, nor established NGOs, nor media would go. Smart, committed, resilient, these groups might be the backbone of Nepal\'s emergent alternative leadership. Later in the year, we worked with the United Nations Development Programme and United Nations Volunteers to develop <a href="/t/future-makers-global/599">a new, radical program of community-driven, bottom up urban planning</a>. \xa0With the help of our global community, we discovered and reached out to civic innovators in Armenia, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Morocco and Ukraine. As often before, this work left us in awe of just how good people are at self-organizing, even in difficult circumstances.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Adding capacity for analysis to the Edgeryders platform</strong>. With the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, we developed and tested <a href="/t/open-ethnographer/578">Open Ethnographer</a>, a Drupal module for in-platform ethnographic coding. It works. We also collaborated with a European Commission-funded research project called <a href="/t/catalyst-collaboration/426">CATALYST</a>. CATALYST\'s mission was to develop software, that would extract collective intelligence from online conversations. We did some testing for them, and ended up adopting two of their applications. This makes us better at delivering collective intelligence outcomes from the Edgeryders conversation.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Engaging in a sales push</strong>. As we felt we had delivered \u2013 even overdelivered \u2013 on our first batch of projects, we tried to get more of them. The idea was to provide more meaningful, paid work for members of the Edgeryders community to take on. Get paid to be radical, do adventurous stuff and attack big problems: that\'s what most of us aspire to. But that did not go so well. We spent a lot of time negotiating and writing proposals. Sometimes we were successful, like in the examples above. But often, too often we just wasted valuable time in unsuccessful bids. We lost two procurement competitions in Italy, one in the UAE, and one in Belgium. We partecipated in five proposals for European research projects, losing three of them and getting kicked out of another one. We did win the one where we had invested the most, though.\xa0</li>\n\n</ul><h3>What we have learned</h3><ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Open online conversations can be an engine of collective intelligence</strong>. For me, this is the single most important lesson I have learned in Edgeryders. Every single time we convene around an interesting question and are enabled to act upon it, we make progress. The conversation acts as a sort of artificial intelligence. It discovers new allies, even on unfavourable terrain; processes scenarios in parallel; reveals rough consensus. It is hard to get it started, but when it gets going it really is powerful.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Text is data</strong>. Collective intelligence in Edgeryders is a human thing. Its engine is human conversation, and it is humans interpreting its results. But technology helps in various ways. The most important one is this: with technology, we can understand conversations at a larger scale than without it. \xa0This opens up exciting possibilities. It also means we are, in our own way, a data company. I have been\xa0<a href="/t/this-is-your-land-edgeryders-as-an-engine-of-collective-intelligence/3364">saying this since 2013</a>, but the past year has made this intuition more concrete.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Sustainability is hard, but achievable</strong>. At the core of Edgeryders there is a symbiotic relationship between an online community and a small social enterprise. The community contains the skills, the drive, the experience. The company transforms online debate into expert advice, powered by collective intelligence. Expert advice can be packaged and sold. The Edgeryders company styles itself a mutant boutique consultancy company; it makes the sales. It then gives back to the community, in the form of work opportunities that are meaningful and paid (in financial year 2014-2015 we have paid out hard cash to about 40 edgeryders, not counting company directors). This is the theory. In practice, selling is hard. Clients think we are interesting and innovative, but would rather not be the first ones to adopt. We have to be honest, and tell them this is new and experimental. It may fail. Worse: collective intelligence does not take orders; if online debate sees an inconvenient truth, it will throw it in your face. \xa0So, we tell them: if you are not prepared to face hard truths, don\'t hire us. Many clients feel this is too scary. \xa0A few do take the plunge. So far they seem to be happy, and come back for more business. So it\'s working, kind of. People in the company are putting in a lot of unpaid work. We may fail due to mistakes or bad luck, but sustainability is certainly possible in principle.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Deploy</strong>. International consultants jet over to foreign capitals; stay at four-star hotels with English-speaking staff; have meetings with government officials; jet back; write the report. Edgeryders rents homes and moves in for months at a time. We hang out in the local hackerspaces, venture out to remote villages, build trust, spend time. It\'s necessary to gain trust and learn to see with the eyes of the local changemakers. It\'s also more fun. It just feels right: we may have a different role, but the people we meet in our missions are exactly people like us. They could be Edgeryders. Some have become Edgeryders, in fact. So we treat them as peers, learn from each other, refuse to think of them as passive "beneficiaries" of what our clients are trying to do. \xa0There are people in Edgeryders who value adventure, and will <em>only</em> do work if they can do it this way. This gives us an edge: we can do stuff that vanilla consultants can\'t. We have a lever for reinventing international consultancy!\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Community is powerful</strong>. Collective intelligence is what happens when the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Collective smarts need not only smart individuals, but also a smart way for individuals to interact. The great lesson we learned from monasticism: human-to-human rules for interaction are important. We have found a name for a coherent collection of such rules designed to encourage the emergence of collective intelligence: <a href="/t/protocol-0-1-engineering-human-to-human-interaction-for-working-together/4748">Protocol</a>. \xa0I believe good Protocol is the single most important ingredient of an online community. I also find Edgeryders has, in general, good Protocol. Sniping, name-calling and rhetorical smoke curtains are almost unheard of. At the same time, people are outspoken, if respectful, in their expressions of disagreement. When Edgeryders is at its best, people argue hard enough to discourage wishful thinking and unsubstantiated claims, but not so hard as to demoralize each other. Action carries more prestige than talk, and no one has veto power over anyone else. Rapid progress ensues. A sign that this is working well: \xa0it produced "blanket endorsement", with some of us willing to support financially complete strangers to take part in an Edgeryders event. This conveys a powerful message: "If you are Edgeryders, I trust you, whoever you are." \xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Community is fragile</strong>. One or two defectors with good rhetorical skills can break Protocol and upset a whole community. We had some episodes of this in Edgeryders. While unimportant in themselves, they were upsetting and time-consuming. We have learned never to take Protocol for granted, and to defend it at all costs. This means having low tolerance for trolling. If people do not feel completely at ease with Protocol, they should feel free to leave in friendship. <a href="/t/edgeryders-and-unmonastery-what-changed-and-what-remains-the-same/4991">This happened last year</a> with some of the people involved in Matera\'s prototype unMonastery. Bickering about consensus decision making versus do-ocracy was improductive and frustrating. So they created their own organization, and now we have two variants of the unMonastery, one committed to consensus, the other to do-ocracy. Great! We can experiment with two alternative models, and learn from both.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Dyson sphere</strong>. There\'s plenty of skilled people in the Edgeryders community. Together, we can supply a wide range of products and services. Whenever the Edgeryders the company needs to hire, or buy a service, we try to buy it from the community. We try to recirculate every euro that we get from clients, so that it helps some community project stay up. We think of this as building a Dyson sphere around the primary client; together, we can catch and reuse most of its economic energy. Example: <a href="/t/development-started/5126">we hired </a><a href="/u/gandhiano"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/gandhiano">@gandhiano</a>\xa0to do work on our platform, and are planning to move its hosting over to the Ecobytes collective. This helps us, because we get a better platform and better services. It also helps Ecobytes\' cash flow. Double win!</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Take responsibility for the boring admin stuff</strong>. At the onset of the Edgeryders company, a member on the board of directors took on responsibility for all things legal and financial. That was a bad idea. The person made sure he was the only one with access to the bank account. This resulted in a complete lack of transparency about Edgeryders legals and financials. The rest of us in the board underperformed, too. We let him get away with this behaviour for a long time, because we were conflict-averse. When we finally applied pressure to set up transparent accounting, he resigned. He refused to release records, so \xa0we had to report it and him to the British tax authority and rebuild them. As we did so, we discovered unpaid bills, unrecorded income, \xa0unjustified payments (including to himself), out-of-date legal records and other pleasantries. This is not one person\'s failure, though we did pick a bad apple. The whole board has legal responsibility. It was our mess, and we had to clean it up. We decentralized accounting and finances, and increased transparency. We redid the <a href="/company/home">company website</a> disclosing relevant information, recruited advisors from the community with oversight capacity and are now taking turns running the accounting software. Accounting and finance are boring, but we have to take responsibility for them. Dumping it on a "money guy" (or woman) is irresponsible.\xa0</li>\n\n</ul><h3>What\'s next and how you can be part of it</h3><ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Platform overhaul</strong>. As Edgeryders evolves, the edgeryders.eu platform must evolve too. We have started a major overhaul. The look and feel will change, and many tedious bugs will die. We estimate that the next incarnation of edgeryders.eu will go live some time in March 2016, and serve us until the end of 2017. After that, though, we might have to switch to a completely different core tech. Drupal 7 won\'t be here forever. In about one year we will start discussing out long term option. You can be part of the current effort helping <a href="/u/gandhiano"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/gandhiano">@gandhiano</a>\xa0test his <a href="https://test.edgeryders.boa.ecobytes.net/">development site</a>. Follow updates and take on tasks on the <a href="/t/edgeryders-dev-testing/331">Edgeryders Development Group</a>.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>LOTE5</strong>. Fail/unFail, the 5th episode of Living On The Edge is coming soon to Brussels. We have partnered up with <a href="http://www.antiheroes.org/">Antiheroes</a>, part of the community since 2014, to build an <a href="/edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/welcome-to-lote5">event centered on failure</a>. \xa0<a href="/u/kiravde"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/kiravde">@KiraVde</a>\xa0and <a href="/u/ireinga"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/ireinga">@ireinga</a>,\xa0the Antiheroes ladies, are bringing to LOTE some much-needed light-heartedness and sense of fun. \xa0I\'m so looking forward to this! As always, plenty of ways for you to <a href="/edgeryders.eu/en/lote5/getting-your-ticket">take part</a>.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>OpenCare</strong>. This was our one successful European research proposal. It\'s big: 1.6 million euro, of which a bit under 300K administered directly by Edgeryders. It\'s also exciting. <a href="/opencare/welcome-to-opencare">Look it up</a>, stay in touch, let us know if and how you want to collaborate. As always, we\'ll advertise any opening positions on the Edgeryders platform.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Flagship projects</strong>. We want to build "flagship projects": big, bold, sustainable stuff, proposed by the community. If the idea is right, we might be able to build support and momentum around it. OpenCare is an example of a flagship project; the unMonastery is another one. There is space for a few more; get in touch and let\'s talk. But remember: if it\'s your project, you have to lead.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Incubator/accelerator</strong>. So far Edgeryders-the-company has been emergent, with almost no strategy. We don\'t take debt. We don\'t seek investors. We don\'t seek core funding. \xa0We have no business plan. We take on paid work, trying to blend it in the community\'s interests as we go. We refused to do all the usual social startup stuff of investor pitching and spreadsheet compiling. That freed up time and energy to develop our product and test its viability. We now have a product: collective-intelligence powered expert advice, hacker style. We tested it, it\'s viable. Now what? We\'d like to try and do more of it, faster. We are hackers (Matt, Vinay), researchers (Noemi, Asta, myself), designers (Nadia), organisation experts (Patrick, John). We need to boost our business skills and contacts if we are to run a "real" company.\xa0But we are educable, so we are considering incubators/accelerators around the world. If you work in one, or are a mentor or coach, and you would like to work with us, get in touch. We accept that some pitching and spreadsheets might ensue. Hey, the revolution is no gala dinner.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Develop a success indicator (and trust it)</strong>. Is Edgeryders successful? No one knows. On the one hand, we are not moving serious amounts of money. On the other hand, we do seem to have some access to power players and some recognition as trailblazers. I would like to combine monetary (contracts signed?) and non monetary (access to high-level people?) into a sort of "life force index" for Edgeryders. And then, make decisions on the basis of how the index moves. If you like this, let me know and we\'ll take it from there.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>More sales</strong>. We are working hard to get new contracts and new clients. We\'ll be announcing deals as we close them. Do you know of someone that might be interested in hiring Edgeryders as consultants? <a href="/t/the-business-corporation-as-a-symbiont-to-a-community-edgeryders-crosses-a-watershed/4131">Hire yourself into the company</a>, we\'ll help you seal the deal.\xa0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Edgeryders is so new and strange that I can\'t tell whether it\'s headed for stardom or disaster. Both, maybe. Either way, it\'s an interesting journey, and I look forward to finding out where it ends.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 5263, u'user_id': 4, u'timestamp': u'2016-02-05 08:31:12', u'title': u"Edgeryders 2.0.1.6 : where we are and what's coming next"}, {u'content': u'<p>Some time ago we agreed to schedule our kickoff meeting at the same time as the <a href="/t/welcome-to-lote5/4849">Living On The Edge 5 Edgeryders event</a>, to take advantage of that particular effort. That means 25-28 February 2016.</p>\n\n<p>What\'s missing is a schedule of our activities, and time is getting tight if we are to engage with other people out there (and we are). I propose we do two things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>One day of talking</strong>. This would be a closed-door meeting for the consortium only. Closed-doors means we all are welcome to invite external people (for example with a view to future partnerships), but other than that we will just have a regular meeting. We will cover collaboration procedure and tools; admin; and detailed planning on the first six months of so of the project. We will also schedule the second consortium meeting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>One day of doing</strong>. This would be an open-door event scheduled within LOTE5, which anybody can attend \u2013 the more the merrier. Call it the first of the OpenCare onboarding workshops. Here we have several possibilities. I see at least three very attractive things we could do:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\xa0<strong>Masters of Networks</strong>. A hackathon based on network methodology and data. <a href="/u/melancon"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/melancon">@melancon</a>\xa0and myself have some experience in delivering those \u2013 of course we would need care-related network data. See this short video to get an idea of what happens at Masters of Networks events.\xa0\n\n<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2-9z0i5fuvE?rel=0">https://www.youtube.com/embed/2-9z0i5fuvE?rel=0</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>A workshop on designing community-driven care services</strong>. This could be led by <a href="http://www.shareable.net/blog/design-for-social-innovation-an-interview-with-ezio-manzini">Ezio Manzini</a>.\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>One or more talks to present the project by conveying the urgency of the issue</strong>. I would love a talk by <a href="/u/markomanka"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/markomanka">@markomanka</a>\xa0on healthonomics, for example \u2013 how incentives are very seriously warped in this field. <a href="/u/lakomaa"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/lakomaa">@Lakomaa</a>\xa0might also have something to say in this respect: additionally, in Italy we found a health economist (works as a comptroller in the Italian public health system) called Simona Ferlini who has a lot of insider knowledge to contribute.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>My preference would be for doing all of the above, and perhaps even more. Maybe <a href="/u/costantino"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/costantino">@Costantino</a>\xa0and <a href="/u/zoescope"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/zoescope">@zoescope</a>\xa0can think of some maker-related stuff to do? But of course these things eat up time. There is no point in doing a hackathon in less than a full day\'s work, for example. So, if we do everything, the program could look like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Closed door meeting: 24th February.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Masters of Networks: 25th of February, within LOTE5</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Design workshop and talks: 26th of February, within LOTE5.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>What does everyone think?\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 5013, u'user_id': 4, u'timestamp': u'2015-11-18 10:52:55', u'title': u"Let's launch!

What\'s going to happen?</h2>\n\n<p>As part of the <a href="/t/storytelling-workshop-narratives-of-care-2016/5146">Storytelling Workshop: Narratives of care 2016</a>, <a href="/u/thomas_goorden"><span class="mention">@Thomas</span> Goorden</a> will be leading an experiential and intensive workshop loosely based on Joe Edelman\'s "<a href="https://quip.com/kc4jAKO83gUD" rel="nofollow noopener">Hyperactive Listening</a>" format.</p>\n\n<p>You can participate as either "<strong>Story</strong>" or as "<strong>Storyteller</strong>":</p>\n\n<h3>Story</h3>\n\n<p>Your "story" will become the center of an investigative group exercise. The messier your "story", the better the workshop will be. Perhaps you are working on a project, but aren\'t really sure what it is or have difficulty explaining it to people? Perhaps you are stuck in some kind of dilemma or conflict that you find difficult to get past? Perfect! We will take a significant amount of time to figure out what is going on and help you get on your way (again).</p>\n\n<p>The outcome of the workshop (for you) will be text, diagrams, video and pictures that you can use to explain your story when those questions come up once more.</p>\n\n<p>What kind of story? any story, but reflect on how it ties to\xa0health/social care+ technology +communities</p>\n\n<h3>Storyteller</h3>\n\n<p>A good storyteller is in the first place someone who can <em>listen</em> to someone\'s story (even if it is your own). You\'ll then get to ask questions, investigate, analyze, try to distil the essence of a story, receive feedback and start from the beginning again. Until we get it "right".</p>\n\n<p>You\'ll learn and practice all sorts of skills valuable for telling your own stories when they need it. And of course you will discover all sorts of projects other people are working on. But mostly, you will have the deep satisfaction of having been able to help someone.</p>\n\n<h2>B. Participants Registration</h2>\n\n<p>Please follow the instructions on the event page:\xa0<a href="/t/storytelling-workshop-narratives-of-care-2016/5146">Storytelling Workshop</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>C. What else?</h2>\n\n<p>We will practice some experimental identity/co-counseling methods in between story sessions. The goal here is to see if you can discover new, profound truths about your own story.</p>\n\n<p>You will also be invited to provide feedback on the workshops methods themselves. Since they are quite new and/or relatively unknown, we welcome improvements and commentary.</p>\n\n<h3>Your output from the workshop: a professional kit\xa0</h3>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, we will have fleshed out together a\xa0number of strong narratives on care.\xa0In this case, this means engaging\xa0stories that participants can showcase later on to build support for their project. The person behind the "story" will gain:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>a hi-resolution photograph\xa0</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>text and diagrams illustrating the story</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>a short video recording\xa0</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the video, we will add a "scribe" and a "confessional" (video) booth. Only one participant can really be the focus during a certain period (I\'d say min 30 minutes), so it restricts how many projects could be "processed".

In a short time the populations of small countries in the region, Lebanon and Jordan, have grown manyfold (1.1 Million refugees in Lebanon, 630,000 in Jordan - in addition to Palestinian refugees already there). Some reading materials with up to date, detailed information:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Armenia:</strong> <a href="/t/refugee-care-system-in-armenia-and-how-to-improve-it/5009">Anna\u2019s report from Yerevan</a> is a good introduction. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2ulC5rjYSncOTRoZThTWlljWk0/view?usp=sharing">Five Years On | Syria Crisis-related needs and vulnerabilities in Jordan</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>While many of the cities and towns receiving refugees face similar challenges there is a significant difference. <strong>Some are transit locations, which asylum seekers pass on their way on to other destinations</strong>. <strong>They include major cities in Greece, Italy and Turkey, as well as small coastal towns </strong>from which people leave on boats to take their perilous journey across the sea. There, volunteers do their best to care for their immediate physical needs and the mandated administrative/security procedures to grant them entry onto the mainland.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other cities and towns  are receiving the newcomers on a more long term basis.</strong> This happens <strong>in two different phases</strong>, each one posing its own  political, administrative and infrastructural challenges for the hosting communities. The first one is the <strong>period of time between arrival and the approval or rejection of the person\u2019s application for refugee status</strong>. This period could be very long, as in the case of the Palestinian refugees in Jordan, or that of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/10/14/meet-the-eritrean-refugee-who-stands-for-everything-that-can-go-wrong-with-asylum-applications/">Mr. Teferi in Norway</a>. The second one is the <strong>period that starts what happens once individual has secured refugee status</strong>. In this period, the challenge is navigating the difficult period between receiving the papers and being fully established in the social and economic life of the host new community.</p>\n\n<p>While the details differ, the problems and needs mentioned by mayors, NGOs and activists fall into one or more of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Resource efficiency: How to get better at covering necessities of both refugees and citizens/ residents on very limited resources?</strong> As an example Jordan is one of the most water scarce countries in the world and 70 per cent of the population suffers from inadequate water supply below the national standard of 100 liters/person/day. Aging infrastructures, inefficiencies in operation and maintenance. interrupted provision of water services etc. <strong>Could resource scarcity be mitigated through Open Source technologies for recycling of sewage, seawater desalination at scale, deep drip irrigation etc?</strong> Affordable, modifiable technologies are required to manage the current crisis as well as <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/01/22/3191081/dangerous-climate-change-impact/">to secure peace in the region</a>.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Interoperability, knowledge transfer and Institutional memory:</strong> I heard many calls to \u201cmake information available about how the system works\u201d, and "calls for online platforms to fix a perceived lack of information" thought to be a "key obstacle for labor market access". Here too I head that \u201cwe need a database of all the initiatives and resources available to help refugees\u201d and "we need to make existing information about getting your paperwork done, how to set up a new business etc". <strong>There are</strong> <strong>three underlying assumptions</strong>: 1) That some people understand in detail \u201chow the system works\u201d as a whole and 2) That they can transmit that kind knowledge into brochures or documents and that 3) This information material will make the system navigable and penetrable for newcomers. These three assumptions do not hold up to scrutiny and could fill an entire blogpost with reasons as to why. For now I will simply refer you to the <a href="http://www.brickstarter.org/Brickstarter.pdf">Brickstarter report</a> as it is a light, beginner-friendly introduction to some of the issues.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Scalability of public services: How to build/rethink provision of public services so that they can accommodate changes in the number of people to serve? </strong>Many of the participants complained about the lack of resources to provide education or training for newcomers. Others mentioned the provision of health and social care services, especially psychological support for the traumatised. I heard a lot of calling for more resources to be put into existing services, but little examination of how existing services are performing and even less awareness about more effective, flexible and cost-efficient approaches. <strong>Are we sure that throwing money onto more of the same will result in better outcomes?</strong>  Sugata Mitra\u2019s work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimally_invasive_education">Minimally Invasive Education</a>, Miguel Chavez\u2019s experienced from <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7540-maker_spaces_in_favelas_-&lt;em&gt;lecture">building Makerspaces in Favelas</a>, <a href="http://berlin.freifunk.net/index&lt;/em&gt;en/">Freifunk</a> and many others offer alternative approaches with promising results. The political will, and practical ability, to welcome and accommodate newcomers depends on it. In this <a href="/en/opencare/welcome-to-opencare">recent talk</a>, I present a proposal for how we can break out of the zero-sum thinking in the provision of care services as an antidote to rising social tensions between social groups.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>One of the outcomes of the conference was that Mayors from Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Greece, Italy and Austria signed a <a href="http://now-conference.org/declaration/">declaration to work together</a> in solidarity across borders:</p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/2308ee4564f49cfa274b2ed0ced598f046ad2ca1" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2308ee4564f49cfa274b2ed0ced598f046ad2ca1.jpg" class="lightbox" title="NOWDeclaration.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/2308ee4564f49cfa274b2ed0ced598f046ad2ca1_1_666x500.jpg" width="666" height="500"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">NOWDeclaration.jpg</span><span class="informations">960x720 92.9 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div></p>\n\n<p><strong>Politically, this is an important signal. However the event didn\u2019t get into the part I find the most interesting- <em>how</em> they intend to go from <em>intention</em> to <em>implementation</em>.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>So what is needed in order for this commitment to be delivered on?</strong> Based on discussions with mayors, activists and refugees described it looks like the participants at NOW need:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Efficient and sustainable coordination across geographic, linguistic and technological barriers.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>A globe-spanning sustained effort to help community leaders, mayors, politicians and fight back against populist rhetoric and divisive narratives.</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>Ability to learn about and experiment with novel or unconventional approaches towards tackling root causes of problems which affect both newcomers and the host communities which welcome them.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>In practice this would require:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Active engagement of a lot of affected people in mapping and making sense of urgent problems related to a sudden influx of newcomers in education, housing, employment/entrepreneurship, language/social skills and finance</strong>. The reason being that those affected will only get behind efforts to solve problems if they trust the people involved, and have shared ownership in the process. Part of what builds trust is if people can recognise their own perspective, language and experiences in the description of the situation. That they are taken seriously as experts in their own lives- that their own <em>ambitions</em>, <em>words</em> and <em>thoughts</em> weigh at least as much as input of credentialed domain experts (who may never have set foot in the neighborhood). This was echoed by newcomers frustrated by discussions about training them to fit into pre-defined slots in society, based on what they perceived to be unfounded assumptions by instutitonal actors about what they could or could not achieve: <em>\u201cDo not put a cap on my dreams, just give me access to the tools and see what I can build with them\u201d.</em>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>Continuous mapping and connection of different private, public and third sector actors efforts into coherent shared plans</strong> that take into consideration the budgetary, logistical and political constraints within which each group is working. I can tell you from experience that is it not easy. The reason being that the incentives are aligned against it. We all agree that at the system level good documentartion saves everyone time and resources. At the individual level it is more difficult to motivate the additional investment of time and effort. Where you see people doing this consistently is where it is a part of a shared culture and work ethos. So to get this going you have to create the incentives for people to do additional work involved, instill the ethos and teach people the workflow and enforce it top down until there is a critical mass doing it and others can share the effort of spreading and maintaining the cullture.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Take a minute to think about what this means.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>If the participants in the event want to see the transnational cooperation happen in practice, then they will have to learn to think and work as networks</strong> <strong>of individuals</strong> interacting inside, outside and all around different organisations. Each working at the hyperlocal, micro-level, while sharing and learning with others working in different contexts as a natural part of the everyday workflow\u2026 not just something afforded to people who can travel and spend 2 days talking with one another at a conference. And all of this done <strong>in</strong> <strong>ways that build granular, immediately relevant and continuously updated institutional memory accessible to all.</strong> Affecting behavioral change at this scale is hard, but it can be done.</p>\n\n<p>I think <strong>we can contribute in two ways.</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>At LOTE5 we are organising this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/179569975738885/">reflexive design exercise on Collaborative inclusion: how migrants-residents collaboration can produce social values</a>.</strong> The event is run by Ezio Manzini, one of the world\u2019s top-notch designers for social innovation.<strong> You can partner with us</strong> if you want to help make it into a workshop on addressing specific problems tied to reception and inclusion of asylum seekers in some of the cities and towns represented at the conference. Or just sign up and part</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>We also have a way to produce cheap, accurate ethnographic data around problems like the ones mentioned above, with a focus on surfacing creative and actionable solutions</strong>. This would enable you to engage a large number of participants (thousands) in a participatory process for designing solutions to meet their own needs. This methodology is being employed/supported by a growing number of actors including the current Swedish minister of Nordic cooperation and strategic foresight, the European Commission, the Rockefeller Foundation, the United Nations Development Program and United Nations Volunteers as well as the cities of Milan and Matera in Italy, and of Bucharest in Romania. <strong>We have developed a methodological guide for doing this - </strong><span>email me if you would like a copy: nadia@edgeryders.eu.</span></p></li>\n</ol>', u'post_id': 5233, u'user_id': 8, u'timestamp': u'2016-01-27 23:40:01', u'title': u'After #NowConf: How can mayors, funders and activists collaborate to #unfail the "refugee crisis"?'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 5056, u'user_id': 2330, u'timestamp': u'2015-12-01 00:02:59', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}, {u'content': u'<p>At Edgeryders we are racing to set different puzzle pieces into place so that people from all over the world who wish to come and meet each other face to face can do so despite money obstacles.

Maybe you are trying to do your bit for this lovely blue planet and its slightly dysfunctional dominant species; maybe you are following your own need to express yourself through art, or some other creative channel; maybe you are trying to build businesses that will do good, rather than just make money; maybe you are just exploring your own life hacks. Either way, you live on the edge of society \u2013 like most of us on Edgeryders. Will welfare be around for you when you need it? Most of us are very. Damn. Sceptical.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>States and the private sector are struggling to provide everyone with high-quality, affordable health and social care. For now, the most likely outcome is a dual society, with insiders having access to 20th century-style welfare and an ever-growing precariat left to provide for itself. <strong>The welfare put in place by previous generations is failing. Time to learn how to make our own.</strong></p>\n\n<p>LOTE5 is the perfect place to explore the issue. We do so through a workshop called\xa0<a href="/opencare/let-s-co-create-our-own-welfare-how-to-design-collaborative">Let\u2019s co-create our own welfare: how to design collaborative care services</a>. The basic question we explore: <strong>can communities build sustainable, adequate care services for their own members? How can we take care of each other in a way that is resilient to systemic crises, political fads, budget cuts and so on? </strong>Consistently with LOTE ethos, we take a "no spectators" approach and treat everyone who decides to attend as a designer.\xa0<strong>The workshop is led by <a href="http://www.shareable.net/blog/design-for-social-innovation-an-interview-with-ezio-manzini">Ezio Manzini</a>, one of the world\'s most prominent experts in design for social innovation. Participation is free, but registration is required</strong>. To register, follow <a href="/t/getting-your-ticket/4915">these steps</a>.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>In the next weeks, we shall be zeroing in on some service that we can work on as an example of the "care by communities approach". <strong>One idea is to look at services for refugees</strong>. Here in Belgium (and, I suspect, elsewhere too) refugees are processed by government bureaucracies in an "old industrial" way: people are treated like a flow of some raw material, and funneled into a production line. From anecdotal evidence we are collecting, it seems such production line is bureaucracy at its worst; different steps must be done in sequence and not in parallel; "hurry and wait" dominates; refugees sit through interviews in which they are\xa0<em>never</em>\xa0asked what they can do, how can they contribute to the host society; they can be vouched for by social workers who have never seen them before, but not by the Belgian people they live in the homes of, etcetera.</p>\n\n<p>This seems like a major fail. <strong>But we refuse to design a service for refugees without the participation of refugees as designers</strong>, even as an exercise. If you are interested in this problem and can bring first-hand experience, get in touch, and we\'ll see what we can do together.\xa0</p>', u'post_id': 5068, u'user_id': 4, u'timestamp': u'2015-12-07 10:58:52', u'title': u'Co-creating our own welfare: a #LOTE5 workshop led by Ezio Manzini and how you can be part of it'}, {u'content': u'<p><em><br><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/3275a53c1c7e82b733696b9013e7955e2a1a2a5a" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3275a53c1c7e82b733696b9013e7955e2a1a2a5a.jpg" class="lightbox" title="Smiling_girl_by_Nathan_Rupert_small.jpg"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/3275a53c1c7e82b733696b9013e7955e2a1a2a5a_1_690x460.jpg" width="690" height="460"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">Smiling_girl_by_Nathan_Rupert_small.jpg</span><span class="informations">1800x1200 790 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div>\n<br></em></p>\n\n<p>In January, Edgeryders will be starting a new project, called <a href="/opencare/welcome-to-opencare">OpenCare</a>. The vision behind it goes like this: welfare as we know it is broken, squeezed between rising costs and impersonality, if not dehumanisation, of the services provided. OpenCare aims at deploying collective intelligence to design, prototype and evaluate care services by communities, for communities.\xa0</p>\n\n<p>If it sounds familiar, it is. This is the typical pattern of acknowledging failure and trying to be constructive (if sometimes radical) and do something about it that permeates the culture of so many dwellers of the edge of societies. It fits perfectly into Living On The Edge 5. So, we in the OpenCare consortium decided to join the LOTE5 effort. We see benefits both for OpenCare and for LOTE5.</p>\n\n<p><strong>OpenCare gets to flex its openness muscle</strong>. EU-funded research tends to be organisationally conservative: closed-door meetings, emails, waterfall management architecture, and many, many boxes to tick. In other words, they work like a corporation, plus or minus the evil <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy-haired_Boss">pointy-haired boss</a>. \xa0OpenCare was written with online open collaboration at its core, so not only we get away with radical openness: we are\xa0<em>committed</em>\xa0to it. LOTE5 will allow us to run an experiment in openness: have a meeting of the consortium with the doors throw wide open. Anybody who wishes to contribute, learn or teach something is welcome. We call this <a href="/opencare/open-meetings">open meetings</a>.\xa0</p>\n\n<p><strong>LOTE5 gets a whole new track, dedicated to failing/unFailing in health and social care</strong>. OpenCare has considerable expertise to share. We are planning at least:\xa0</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<strong>One or more sessions on what we call Healthonomics</strong>. Why do experts say "health care budgets can never go down, only up"? How can the same MRI cost <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/why-an-mri-costs-1080-in-america-and-280-in-france/2011/08/25/gIQAVHztoR_blog.html">1,080$ in the U.S. and 280$ in France</a>? How is it possible that <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34320413">a pill that costs 1$ to produce is sold for 750$</a>, and how can you <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34320413">defend a 5,000% increase</a> in its price?

Furthermore, services designed and deployed by skilled communities of hackers are likely to be very different from those provided by the state and the private sector.

Introduction</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>Edgeryders\u2019 Future Makers Nepal project was initiated by UNDP Nepal </span><span>with the aim to research</span><span>, contact and connect alternative leaders in Nepal using an online platform. As part of this work, we had to carry a \u201cmapping of existing virtual dialogue spaces in Nepal\u201d, the findings of which we detail in this report.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Our start of the work in Nepal coincided with the 25 April 2015 earthquake, after which a huge number of existing web-based dialogue and collaboration spaces was re-purposed for community-driven disaster response, and a similar number of new spaces and initiatives was created for this purpose. These were the most vibrant online communities of alternative leaders in Nepal in the weeks past the earthquake, so we have put particular emphasis on mapping them in the following report.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>We find and analyze in detail how after the 25 April earthquake, mostly young volunteers </span><span>came to the fore</span><span>, creating their own dialogue and collaboration spaces and on-the-ground initiatives to tackle the effects of the disaster. Effectively, a spontaneous movement of community-driven earthquake response initiatives formed. About half of the initiatives involved formed spontaneously after the earthquake, and a portion of them will transform into new, sustainable dialogue and collaboration spaces in Nepal;s civil society, beyond the current context of earthquake relief. We were lucky to be able to capture the formation of these nascent dialogue and collaboration spaces in this mapping report.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>The analysis is devised based on an online database that is created for keeping track of people and organizational initiatives involved in the disaster response activities. It focuses on aspects such as nature of the initiatives, focus of the initiatives, the activity location and the scale of activity. Offline and online dialogue between citizen driven disaster response initiatives and alternative leaders form the basis of analysis in assessing the level of community-engagement. </span><span>The online dialogue spearheads the understanding of the importance of grass-root efforts in the disaster response. It serves as a unique platform to discuss and learn how people work and coordinate at times of crisis, what motivates them and how they reflect upon their initiatives. </span><span>This ultimately helps</span><span>\xa0in strengthening and developing a stronger civil society base which can devise constructive solutions to problems, develop sustainable collaboration between people and relief organizations and prepare Nepal for unforeseen circumstances in the future.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>This report provides an overview of some of</span><span>\xa0the</span><span>\xa0community driven responses to </span><span>the recent crisis</span><span>\xa0in Nepal. For the purpose of this study we define \u2018community-driven responses to disaster\u2019 as any disaster</span><span>-related</span><span>\xa0response activities that </span><span>are</span><span>\xa0not initiated by professionals officially </span><span>designated to do relief work </span><span>(including security forces, government</span><span>al structures</span><span>, UN system, INGOs and NGOs among others). The Future Makers Nepal team did a preliminary mapping of </span><span>121</span><span>\xa0volunteer driven disaster responses that emerged in Nepal in a span of a month following the earthquake.</span><span>\xa0The following findings are a result of a two-week-long analysis of the data available online, combined with conclusions derived from informal meetings with people engaged in the relief efforts.</span></p>\n\n<h1>\n\n</h1><p><a name="h.txsl6dtrz1pj"></a><span>2. Situation Overview</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>A 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal on</span><span>\xa0the</span><span>\xa025</span><span>\xa0</span><span>April 2015 and was followed by numerous aftershocks left thousands dead, injured and properties worth millions ravaged. The earthquake also destroyed</span><span>\xa0some of the</span><span>\xa0most important cultural heritage of Nepal. The government report shows that over 35 of the 75 districts are affected in the Central and Western Regions including the Kathmandu Valley and </span><span>14 of these districts were identified as \u2018priority affected districts\u2019</span><span>\xa0depending upon the severity of the damage. Reportedly, Gorkha, Dhading, Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, Nuwakot, Bhaktapur, Kathmandu, Lalitpur are the districts that are highly affected by the earthquake. As of 31 May, the Home Ministry reported a total of 8,693 deaths, 22,221 people injured and over 505,000 homes fully destroyed and another 275,000 partially destroyed.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" name="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>\xa0The earthquake also ravaged more than 70 percent of the cultural heritages of Nepal listed in the UNESCO heritage site.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" name="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span>\xa0In addition, the official estimates put forth by the World Health Organisation show that 8.1 million people out of a population of 28 million have been affected by the earthquake, amongst which 1.7 million are children.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Nepal\u2019s Ministry of Education estimates that 23,644 classrooms have been damaged or destroyed, and an additional 10,922 classrooms have received minor damages in the priority affected districts alone.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" name="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span>\xa0For a country like Nepal, prior to the earthquake tackling an alarming number of issues pertaining to political tensions, slow economic progress, poverty, unemployment, energy crunch, among others, the task of rebuilding now turns out to be </span><span>a herculean one</span><span>. The country now faces another major setback in its development trajectory and what is needed at this hour of crisis is a good leadership and above all the collective strength of common people. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>However</span><span>, the way the young Nepalese took up the task of reaching out to the victims speaks a lot about the concern they have shown towards their society, thus </span><span>projecting</span><span>\xa0a sense of natural \u2018community resilience\u2019. While majority of the people remained outside houses for numerous days, there were these certain groups of individuals and organizations that took charge. They worked day and night to give to the living by voluntarily rendering whatever support they could. Some crowd-sourced funds for immediate relief or transported relief materials to the affected areas, while others took up the task of setting up platforms for disseminating crucial information outside the traditional modes of communication, and a significant number of youths collaborated with government authorities. The preliminary mapping for this report recorded 121 voluntary disaster response initiatives out of probably more than 250 voluntary disaster response initiatives that have published anything online, and many more who did not. It will be years before Nepal recovers from this catastrophe, however, the country is fortunate to have motivated youths, bounded with an unprecedented sense of collective responsibility, community spirit and social consciousness to rebuild Nepal.</span></p>\n\n<h1>\n\n</h1><p><a name="h.3uys1on7avna"></a><span>3. </span><span>Methods and Data</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>The data pertaining to community-driven initiatives after the 25th of </span><span>April</span><span>\xa0earthquake and subsequent aftershocks are gathered through online and offline sampling. Most of the data was extracted manually from publicly available, unstructured Internet content published by the respective initiatives. This method was fast and efficient to stay within project constraints, and lead to relatively complete results. The alternative of inviting initiatives to a survey would have lead to somewhat more exact data, but would have been slower, taking time away from actual relief efforts and thus only a low turnover could have been be expected.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>An online database of individuals and initiatives that were involved in various types of post-earthquake disaster response endeavours is devised to collect certain type of information the research focuses on. Based upon this dataset, initiatives are selected and featured in the Future Makers Nepal online platform through interviews and are invited to take part in the online dialogue that this virtual community supports. The method also uses case studies as a basis of qualitative analysis in examining the initiatives, their nature, scope and challenges. These case studies are further taken as a basis for formulating an analysis for the post- earthquake disaster response carried out by people and institutions. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>At this stage, the database contains 121 records of community-driven disaster response initiatives. Initiatives are further analyzed by devising categories to measure the intensity and diversity of their earthquake relief responses and recording this information in the database.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>The first criterion concerns the activities carried out by the community-driven initiatives. Categories for this are largely </span><span>aligned with the UN cluster system</span><span>\xa0for comparability. However, sub-categories for activities have been added where required, allowing a more detailed analysis of interesting aspects not covered by a UN cluster system categorization. For instance, the information management category is further divided into crisis mapping and volunteer placement, and the relief supplies category is further segregated by type of supplies.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>The location of the initiatives has been analyzed on a district level. Where more specific information was not publicly available, initiatives that operate location-independent (e.g. fundraising campaigns) have been assigned the 14 </span><span>government designated priority affected districts.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" name="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><span>The initiatives and projects are also analyzed based upon their nature, that is to say if they have emerged spontaneously following the 25th of April earthquake or if they derived from the pre-existing organization structures that diverted their focus after the earthquake.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Finally, the scale of the initiatives has been recorded, using categories that could be easily inferred from publicly available information and are meant to gauge the internal coordination complexity of the initiatives; namely, if the initiative was an individual effort, or a work done by one team, multiple teams, or multiple teams using multiple base locations.</span></p>\n\n<h1>\n\n</h1><p><a name="h.cnx8iernizxf"></a><span>4. </span><span>Findings</span></p>\n\n<h2>\n\n</h2><p><a name="h.fuim2cg4kagu"></a><span>4.1. Characteristics of Dialogue and Collaboration Initiatives</span></p>\n\n<h3>\n\n</h3><p><span>Activit</span><span>ies</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>Each community-driven earthquake response initiative was sorted into all types of response activity categories. </span><span>The current dataset shows the following significant clusters of activity:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<span>Supplies </span><span>\u2013 </span><span>With 58 of 121 mapped initiatives (48</span><span>% approx.) covering this</span><span>, the immediate supply of relief materials was the most common choice of activity. Initiatives further differed by the selection of relief materials they provided (shelter supplies like tarps or tents, food supplies, health supplies incl. hygiene and medicinal articles, educational materials, housing reconstruction materials, and \u2018other supplies\u2019; </span><span>see image 1 for a breakdown</span><span>). Initiatives were only assigned a \u2018supplies\u2019 category if they simply provide materials to people in need, without using them further on location (like for example for building shelters).</span>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<span>Information management</span><span>\xa0\u2013 </span><span>About </span><span>41% of initiatives covered information management, making this the second most commonly chosen activity. It is interesting to note that there was a significant upsurge of an online community dedicated in post conflict disaster management. It was assigned for any relief-associated activity related to relief coordination, assessment, data collection and information sharing beyond the immediate needs of the own initiative. Crisis mapping (creating online and offline maps) and volunteer placement (matching volunteers with opportunities) were separated out into sub-categories as there were many individuals and institutions that focused their disaster response activities towards these. </span><span>Furthermore, </span><span>many</span><span>\xa0</span><span>(62%) </span><span>of the information management endeavors were initiated by persons and organisations that came up spontaneously after the earthquake. Various people and initiatives also created an online record with contact numbers and hotlines of relevant government authorities, hospitals, medical clinics, blood donations and ambulance services.</span>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<span>Fundraising</span><span>\xa0\u2013 Fundraising turned out to be another mostly opted disaster response initiative which was voluntarily carried out by individuals and organisations. The finding shows 17% of initiatives (21 out of 121) taking up the task of crowdfunding campaigns for own or others\u2019 initiatives.. They are split into almost equal numbers of pre-existing and spontaneous initiatives (11 and 10 records, respectively).</span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>Beyond the these major activities above, community-driven initiatives focused on various other areas. The categories used for these activities are:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<span>Education</span><span>\xa0\u2013 building schools, temporary and transitory learning centers in camps and villages, educating teachers about handling PTSD in children, among others.

These can be considered the focus areas of the volunteer initiatives. Given that many number of initiatives rendering volunteer service are centered in Kathmandu and other periphery areas, we can easily infer that the geographical terrain and accessibility still stands as a determining factor for any kind of post- disaster relief operations. Other priority affected districts like Sindhuli, Ramechhap, Dolakha, Makwanpur and Okhaldhunga, and also </span><span>some less affected districts</span><span>\xa0like Pokhara, Lamjung, Solukhumbu also saw several activities of volunteer initiatives carried out in the earthquake affected areas though at slightly lesser scale. </span><span>Okhaldhunga saw the least number of community-driven disaster response initiatives (26 percent of initiatives covered it). This might point to difficult terrain in this hilly district, the distance from Kathmandu as a hub location for initiatives, and / or a perceived low level of damages.</span></p>\n\n<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-download-href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/94991bfd5cd5906bfbfcbb34f39ec1bf410b79ba" href="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/9/94991bfd5cd5906bfbfcbb34f39ec1bf410b79ba.png" class="lightbox" title="image02_0.png"><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/94991bfd5cd5906bfbfcbb34f39ec1bf410b79ba_1_690x409.png" width="690" height="409"><div class="meta">\n<span class="filename">image02_0.png</span><span class="informations">800x475 150 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>\n</div></a></div><br></p>\n\n<p><em><span>Image 2:</span><span>\xa0Deployment locations of </span><span>community-driven disaster response initiatives</span><span>\xa0at district level </span><span>among the 14 priority affected districts.

The </span><span>Rise of New Civil Society in Nepal?</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>When it might have been thought that the country which was already in tatters due to its decade long Maoist conflict and the subsequent political turmoils, reeling problem of corruption and underdevelopment will further divulge in a situation of hopelessness following the recent natural disaster, it was fascinating to see the outpouring of citizen engagement and the rise of new community organisations. What made this rise of \u2018public sphere\u2019 more interesting is the nature of their emergence, that is to say the spontaneity of their rise in the wake of crisis. The findings show that 52% of the mapped organisations that were engaged in disaster response activities were the ones that already existed while 48% of initiatives emerged spontaneously after the crisis. There seems to be a significant number of voluntarily driven citizen engagement endeavors with their focus on supplying immediate relief materials and more importantly, on information management. This is heading towards an emergence of tech savvy, philanthropic new civic leadership. As per the findings, about half (29 of 58) of newly emerged initiatives tasked themselves with general information management </span><span>(</span><span>coordination and need assessment), and several more took on crisis mapping or volunteer placement, in most cases additionally. Based upon these findings we can see a rise of new civil society in Nepal: Besides the conventional civil society activities, largely related to politicised mass mobilisations, there is now a new model of self-directed citizen engagement. The next challenge that lies ahead is to enable this \u2018new public sphere\u2019 to effect lasting social change: rebuilding communities, rehabilitating victims and most importantly, reestablishing enduring trust </span><span>in </span><span>government by coordinating effectively with it.</span></p>\n\n<h1>\n\n</h1><p><a name="h.poijg238t2mz"></a><span>5. </span><span>Case studies: People and Initiatives Making a Difference</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>Based upon the online dialogue</span><span>\xa0that takes place on our edgeryders.eu platform, some of the surveyed initiatives are presented here in more depth as typical examples for different varieties of initiatives, differing by activities (here information management, health, fundraising and providing immediate relief supplies) and scale (here one or multiple teams).

Conclusion and Outlook</span></p>\n\n<h2>\n\n</h2><p><a name="h.guep5ayvydcr"></a><span>6.1. Method Review</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>The chosen method was reasonably effective and efficient to detect key characteristics of the community-driven disaster response movement after the earthquake in Nepal, including activities, location, group nature and scale. It also worked well to inform research questions for follow-up work. However, the nature of the data and data collection prevented us to work out some of the more subtle properties of the movement. Specifically, the limitations arose from:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<span>Inexact data.</span><span>\xa0Since data was collected from publicly available sources, and these publications were made in an unstructured and ad-hoc way in a post-disaster scenario, data would be missing in some cases and be inexact in others. This was countered by choosing a high granularity level (location by district instead of VDC, scale in 5 levels instead of number of collaborators etc.). But consequentially, analysis was limited to this granularity level as well. For example, it is not possible to give an estimate of the amount of relief work done by the community-driven initiatives, or to detect if these initiatives missed out to cover some unserved areas, without conducting a more detailed and time consuming research.</span>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<span>Missing public data.</span><span>\xa0Several interesting pieces of information cannot be reliably determined from public records. For example, it would have been interesting to know the proportions of how many Nepali people and respectively foreigners founded, lead and contributed to initiatives, but this is only possible to find when interviewing initiatives, so hardly in a comprehensive way for all of them</span>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<span>Fuzzy data.</span><span>\xa0Boundaries between initiatives were fuzzy in several cases (e.g. coordinated multi-team initiatives like Yellow House), and the categorization was not able to capture this properly. The same problem applies to numerous activities: they were meant to present the core concerns of initiatives, but some initiatives did \u2018a bit of everything\u2019, making them hard to analyze.</span>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<span>Requiring online information.</span><span>\xa0Relying on analyzing first and secondary source online publications meant that the method could only find initiatives about which something was published online. Due to the ubiquity of Facebook as a coordination tool among initiatives, this includes virtually all initiatives operating from cities. Therefore, the method did not find independent relief operations at village level, which are </span><span>managed by local resources and manpower only and, without the privilege of online coverage, have high chances of going unnoticed. With this method, disaster response volunteers in villages were covered only insofar they collaborated with initiatives reaching out to them from the cities.</span>\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>For a more complete picture of the significance of community-driven earthquake response, potential further research should answer </span><span>the following question</span><span>: How much did the different types of responders contribute to total relief and reconstruction work after the earthquake? This relates to self-help, neighborly help, community-driven disaster response at village level, community-driven disaster response at regional and national level, government and security forces, and disaster response by the international community of donors and response professionals (incl. UN system). This question cannot be answered by mapping using public information as in this study, but would require a field study in randomly chosen settlements, followed by statistical estimation.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>The second major limitation is that of quantitatively analyzing key facts about initiatives does not grant insights into their inner working models, processes and challenges. Follow-up research should employ qualitative methods like ethnography to acquire these insights.</span></p>\n\n<h2>\n\n</h2><p><a name="h.jzicukuin7tr"></a><span>6.2. </span><span>Relevance for Professional Disaster Responders</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>The findings relating to community driven response to the earthquake in Nepal can be a basis for professional disaster responders to facilitate broad based local preparedness for long-term emergency response and other local efforts. By devising frameworks and conducting trainings for information management, crisis </span><span>mapping, assessing local power structures, needs evaluation, conflict-resolution skills, supplies management methods, and community-profile development, these professional disaster responders would ultimately contribute by informing the citizens that their involvement is essential to local development well beyond times of disaster. This will in due course of time ultimately foster well-planned and effective reconstruction activities. Likewise, more similar grassroot mobilisation can be planned for, and responded to in the aftermath of the disaster. Furthermore, processes such as bringing together diverse local groups, formation of local groups for planning, establishing long term vision and goal setting for disaster preparedness / recovery and recruitment of experienced local citizens can to lead the reconstruction. They could further also contribute by establishing an alliance between local groups that have been affected from the same areas and set a stage for more effective resource and responsibility sharing during times of crisis. Such alliance can therefore serve as a liaison between local grassroot efforts and more formal structures. Professional disaster responders could ultimately fill in the gaps by rendering support in areas which were not covered by the voluntary institution primarily due to inadequate professional expertise. For instance by providing staff for medical emergencies and treatments. </span></p>\n\n<h2>\n\n</h2><p><a name="h.2t98gxt1vipt"></a><span>6.3. </span><span>Relevance for Disaster Response R&amp;D</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>Disaster response is under increasing scrutiny to work efficiently, transparently and accountable. Thus, it is worth keeping an eye on recent developments in technology, social changes, and grassroots innovations.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>This study identifies and analyzes community-driven disaster response as one of the grassroots innovations that can help to improve current disaster response mechanisms. In its movement-scale form observed in Nepal, community-driven disaster response can be considered an application of Internet-enabled peer-to-peer communication, collaboration and funding mechanisms \u2013 a latest addition to recent disruptive innovations like collaborative</span><span>\xa0economy platforms</span><span>, </span><span>knowledge sharing platforms</span><span>\xa0and </span><span>digital collaboration platforms</span><span>.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt14" name="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span>\xa0Obviously, such a development was only possible after widespread Internet uptake, now a given in urban Nepal.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Designing a tool that further empowers community-driven disaster response and enables efficient coordination and collaboration with professional disaster responders is a task beyond the scope of this project. Relevant research questions for further work include:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<span>Have community-driven disaster response initiatives been truly </span><span>successful in matching needs to provided supplies and help?</span><span>\xa0What factors influence their level of success in this?</span>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li><span>How can the spirit of voluntarism and generosity be sustained when dealing with other challenges in Nepal, not just during a few weeks of volunteer disaster response work?</span></li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li><span>Can the new, spontaneously emerged community-driven initiatives transform into permanent and established actors in civil society? Is that desirable?</span></li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li><span>In what ways can community-driven initiatives contribute to reconstruction?</span></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>For such future work, the database and analysis of initiatives provided here is a viable basis. Informed by it and extrapolating from current technological developments, here is an idea-stage list of possible design aspects of such a tool:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<span>Preparing </span><span>appropriate knowledge tools.</span><span>\xa0</span><span>A major challenge for community-driven disaster response is that they have to build up their knowledge base and coordination toolset while doing the relief work, which means, under severe time constraints and with incomplete information.. Professional disaster preparedness organizations may want to provide support for compiling knowledge into compact \u2018field manuals\u2019 beforehand, esp. including best practices for coordination that were observed among community-driven responses to past disasters.</span>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<span>Humanitarian Data Information System (HDIS).</span><span>\xa0The public Humanitarian Response platform</span><sup><a href="#ftnt15" name="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span>\xa0is a tool provided by UN OCHA to coordinate humanitarian response operations. It provides up-to-date situation reports, event notifications and key documents for download, and is complemented with the recently launched Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) platform.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt16" name="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span>\xa0HDX is a platform for visualizing and downloading datasets, based on the open source software application CKAN.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt17" name="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span>\xa0An information system is a natural extension of this setup. In contrast to downloadable reports, an information system is an online database that provides real-time authoritative information, preventing data redundancy, inconsistency and duplication. This makes it a useful coordination tool also for community-driven disaster response initiatives, which in contrast to professional disaster responders do not have their own internal coordination tools and mechanisms and currently rely on ad-hoc solutions.</span>\n</li>\n\n<p></p>\n<li>\n<span>Phone-based coordination and assessment tool.</span><span>\xa0Different from professional disaster responders, members of community-driven initiatives in Nepal mostly use the phone and unstructured Facebook forums for coordination. They have neither the training, Internet connectivity, patience or formal obligation to coordinate via structured data input into software applications. This limits their own efficiency, and excludes most coordination with professional disaster response organizations (esp. via the UN clusters). To accommodate the contributions of community-driven responses, a national single-number hotline could work. Information managers in a call center would both take and make phone calls to provide and collect information, and would be trained to relay all this to the information system discussed above.</span>\n</li>\n\n</ul><hr><div>\n\n<p><a name="ftnt1">[1]</a><span>\xa0We thankfully acknowledge funding of this research by UNDP Nepal, via contract UNDP/INST/012/2015.</span></p>\n\n</div><div>\n\n<p><a name="ftnt2">[2]</a><span>\xa0Government of Nepal Disaster Risk Reduction Portal, </span><span><a href="http://www.drrportal.gov.np/"></a><a href="http://www.drrportal.gov.np/">http://www.drrportal.gov.np/</a></span><span>, accessed 31 May 2015.</span></p>\n\n</div><div>\n\n<p><a name="ftnt3">[3]</a><span>\xa0</span><span>Rajneesh Bhandari, Jonah M.

This is also the main reason I packed my bags and headed off to Addis Ababa</p>\n\n<p>... to participate in my beautiful cousins\u2019 weddings.</p>\n\n<p>My cousin made clear I was expected to show up in a Habesha Kemis. So on arrival I headed off to Shiro Meda to find a tailor.</p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/1/172308219b7f26802191799083f24d739217aa31.jpg" width="299" height="500"><br></p>\n\n<p>I liked it so much I ended up getting a second one made.</p>\n\n<p>The wedding itself was a ball. With our family being spread across the globe it is rare for so many of us to be in one place at the same time. I really appreciated being able to spend time together in celebration of the most important element of a happy life... love.</p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9ed448321a237d3414a2bf16efc7fcffa94978a3.jpg" width="640" height="383"><br></p>\n\n<p>On the ride to venue where we would dance and try to keep the groom from picking up the bride (yes, literally- tradition), we came into the topic of religion.</p>\n\n<p>I was asked about my religious beliefs which struck me as quite an odd question. .</p>\n\n<p>... Until I found myself in the middle of a massive Timket (Epiphany) procession in a different part of the country a week later.</p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aa29e5bf3b34b6c3775bf6319ff165b60d80bd9a.jpg" width="640" height="383"><br></p>\n\n<p>The same thing happened on numerous occasions in different parts of the country.</p>\n\n<h3>Religion is a big deal in Ethiopia. So is peace.</h3>\n\n<p>So Ethiopia is home to oh about 200 ethnic groups and around 80 languages. However diverse I knew the country was, in my mind always was associated with Christianity and Judaism... a long history that began over 2000 years ago. The Hebrew influence and identity is pretty clear when you wander around Gondar and Lalibela, especially if you dig into historical information about different dynasties that ruled and shaped Ethiopia throughout the centuries.</p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e4d7581b87da395964fd059143a38b34bb19a271.jpg" width="640" height="383"><br></p>\n\n<p>So I was surprised to learn just how large a proportion of the population the Muslim minority is. Almost 40 percent, if I\u2019m not mistaken. And that the one Jewish person in the Bet-Israel village is the guy running the museum frequented by tourists on pilgrimages. Where is everyone?! Oh yeah. Pretty much everyone was evacuated to Israel after the massive drought in the 80s.</p>\n\n<p>I feel a link to this diaspora, all diaspora really. There is something those of us born with feet in many worlds discover sooner or later. That we are not one or the other, but something else.. ours are third, remix, cultures. Religion is one of those sensitive areas we have to develop mechanisms for navigating.</p>\n\n<p>Within my family there are ties to several mega-cities of Africa and Asia where more than half of the world\u2019s 1.3 billion Muslims, and around sixty percent of the world\u2019s 2 billion Christians, live. I was born and have lived in different parts of a Western liberal Europe not sure how to deal with growing tensions between different social groups.</p>\n\n<p>Here and there, what we think of as religious and or ethnic conflicts are often intimately tied to underlying conflicts over resources like land or water.</p>\n\n<p>Rwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa and the <a href="https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/25677/1/gupea_2077_25677_1.pdf">pressure on land has often been put forward as an important factor in the 1994 genocide</a>. I cannot remember where I heard that in the case of Rwanda there were more intra-ethnic murders than between different ethnic groups... the genocide was partially fueled by the need to free up resources. If memory serves me, they had a system ( currently being reformed) in which all land would be passed on to the first son. Which left a class of landless, disenfranchised young men with no hope of accessing a brighter economic future unless some of that land could be freed up...</p>\n\n<p>Israel and Palestine is another example. At the source of this conflict, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Rothstein">Bo Rothstein</a>, lies mixing of religious rhetoric with what is essentially a fight over assets. He claims that you would create the foundation for lasting peace by focusing on resolving the land/economic disputes with compromises for everyone (Swedish article): <a href="http://www.svd.se/opinion/brannpunkt/markavtal-kan-stoppa-valdet_3777014.svd"></a><a href="http://www.svd.se/%E2%80%A6/markavtal-kan-stoppa-valdet_3777014">http://www.svd.se/\u2026/markavtal-kan-stoppa-valdet_3777014</a></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>Other examples of legacy injustice include (thanks <a href="/u/jaycousins"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/jaycousins">@Jaycousins</a></span> ):</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span>Egypt - land is divided amongst all children so within a couple of generations everyone has a tiny patch they can\'t profit from - the result is illegally constructed tower blocks on most of the rare and fertile land in Egypt and a lot of in-family tensions. </span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span>Likewise In England or any other Western Country, the peasantry had their inheritance stolen out from under them long before the lords and merchants started robbing foreign soil. </span></span></span></p>\n\n<p>\u2026 There is much to be learned from Ethiopian history about the importance of tackling inequalities in distribution of property and use rights for building lasting peace. Especially in societies where formal property laws and customary property rights arrangements exist in parallel. I believe some of those lessons are also relevant in societies where land rights are secure but ownership of property is highly concentrated.</p>\n\n<h2>Fixing legacy injustice: Reforming dysfunctional property laws and peace between ethnic groups</h2>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b7c6df2dcd490cfff2c18615a1910e2069282b86.jpg" width="299" height="500"><br>Justice is a prerequisite for peace. While the murderous fascist regime known as the Derg got a lot of things wrong, they did push through land right reforms.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to the civil war against the old feudal order (Haile Selassie, also known as Ras Tefari), the Muslim population was excluded from being able to access land as they were passed along hereditary lines. So your family had to own land in order for you to have hope of owning land. This was the Ristegna system.</p>\n\n<p>Then there was the Gultegna, the nobility, which were granted the right to a fat chunk of the surplus from the land tended by farmers. Basically a rentier class that contributed little or nothing to the development of the country and life of their fellow Ethiopians.</p>\n\n<p>Both were upended by the revolution and land redistributed and finally nationalised. Why?</p>\n\n<p>One of the persistent calls for social justice in the revolution, also during the Derg period, was \u201cland to the tiller\u201d. All the different interest groups got behind this reform as a fundamental requirement. The military dictators could not back out on this demand as they would loose legitimacy amongst the soldiers, many of whom hailed from the southern parts of the country where the problems of unfair distribution of land was particularly strong for historical reasons.</p>\n\n<p>There are still problems, and new ones. Ethiopia is also undeniably doing a lot better than many of the other countries in the region- my impression was that there is a fundamental belief that things are improving, also for those at the wrong end of the power spectrum. Clearly the picture painted depends on who you ask but I could see for myself that e.g. infrastructure is much better in many parts of the country than it used to be.</p>\n\n<p><img src="//edgeryders.eu/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c08fb7c790b42fd792251b59221fc35aedc4a223.jpg" width="640" height="383"><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Most of all people are very aware of how fragile and important peace is</strong>. The story of a popular revolution co-opted by a military regime that then did its best to murder an entire generation is still fresh in the collective memory. I am reminded of this every time I hear any talk of revolution: the move towards a western style liberal democracy is not one that Ethiopians I spoke to value highly. Rather, it is economic rights and development that seem to be at the heart of their concerns.</p>\n\n<p>If we are to achieve peace at home, we need to think about how we tackle legacy injustices against people in different parts of a globalised world. The central pillar is property law and ownership. As Ethiopians learned, it makes sense to start there and not let up till an acceptable solution is reached.</p>\n\n<p>There will be losers. However if they are taking up so much space that it threatens the ability of others to survive. Well, they... all of us, may end up losing a lot more than excess capacity.</p>', u'post_id': 4134, u'user_id': 8, u'timestamp': u'2015-02-13 10:22:57', u'title': u'Ethiocracy: Love, land and peace'}, {u'content': u'<p>Hello all Future Carers. <a href="/u/stefano_maffei"></a><a class="mention" href="/u/stefano_maffei">@Stefano_Maffei</a> write to me that Politecnico is overcommitted and can\'t allocate the time to write its part of the proposal.

Sheffield has suffered structural problems from massive industrial change - the city used to be based on Coal mining and the Steel industry. Now the coal mines are closed, and the Steel mills are manned by robots. There is a very high level of unemployment in the city, and much of the employment that there is is in the public sector - most adults work for the government!</p>\n\n<p>Working as an artist, I saw that the city was failing to adapt to the emerging information economy - South Yorkshire had the lowest uptake of information technology in the UK. Meanwhile, I was making art from trash that I found in skips. Not only was the trash free (yes!) it seemed to me to be the most suitable material with which to make art about urban decline.</p>\n\n<p>Then I started to find computers in the trash. I collected them, with the idea that I would make robot sculptures and other crazy artworks. I was amazed to discover, after some experimentation, that most of the PCs I recovered actually worked! I started to think about why people were throwing these machines away - when the city had a low level of engagement with information technology.</p>\n\n<p>So I started an arts group, "Redundant Technology Initiative" with one rule - we would be the people who would be creative with trash computers. But ONLY trash computers! We would refuse to pay for any technology, and only use what we could get for free. (This was lucky, because me and my friends were unemployed or unpaid artists, and thus completely skint.) We had a few exhibitions, and each time we exhibited, people brought us more computers. Being artists, we made them into "an art installation". (Other people might think, with some justification, that what we had made was was just "a huge pile".)</p>\n\n<p>By 1998 we had rented a warehouse which was scheduled for demolition. One good feature of industrial decline is that space is cheap. We had more than 1000 computers (!!!) some of which worked, some of which could work, and some of which were broken. We made a HUGE installation for a digital arts festival... and then more and more people gave us computers. After a few weeks we had more than 2000 machines.</p>\n\n<p>We started to realise two things:</p>\n\n<p>(1) We didn\'t have any shortage of computers.</p>\n\n<p>(2) We did have a shortage of skill, expertise and creativity.</p>\n\n<p>We learned how to rebuild and reprogram computers really fast, and we found students who also wanted to help. A local college sent us their trainees on "work placement" - and they learned as they helped us to repair the massive numbers of machines. But we then had a very embarrassing problem for an art group. We just weren\'t creative enough. We couldn\'t think of cool things to do with more than about 100 computers - we needed to think of cool things to do with 100 computers PER MONTH.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So we designed "Access Space" - a digital lab where people can walk in and show us how they could be creative and productive with trash technology.</strong> It took 2 years to raise enugh money to start, and after we started, we managed to get ERDF funding to match our initial funds. (NOTE that there was no way we could have accessed ERDF funding with our levels of experience. We came in as a minor delivery partner, insulated from the frightening bureaucracy of the project by more experienced lead partners. This was very lucky for us - and could start a whole new conversation.)</p>\n\n<p>So, in 2000 Access Space opened. We believed it would be a good model to help people get engaged with technology. We invite every visitor to define their OWN objectives with trash technology - it could be making images, sounds, music, robots, websites, designs, photo galleries... It could be building a business, making new networks, rebuilding computers, or whatever. Our key test is that people THEMSELVES set their agenda. We don\'t work with a curriculum. And we don\'t have teachers. Instead, we ask participants to help each other - and because they\'re all working on "cool stuff" not "boring stuff" then people are usually happy to help - and maybe gain ideas, skills and expertise from the experience.</p>\n\n<p>We provide a free, open access digital lab, doing all sorts of things, from computer analysis, repair and recycling to art exhibitions, workshops, peer-learning activities, enterprise incubation, social support and more. We set up this lab as a response to unemployment, urban decline and the transformation of the job market. What we\'ve established is an innovative methodology to invest time, not money, in ICTs. This has huge potential to address worklessness and lack of opportunities. It\'s worth reflecting that many of our participants in Access Space experience the kind of precarity which you are investigating with Edgeryders.</p>\n\n<p>Access Space has a very wide range of participation.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If you split them into three groups, &lt;25years, 25-50years, &gt;50 years, then those groups are roughly similar in size.</p></li>\n<li><p>Roughly 1/3 of our participants are from minority ethnic backgrounds.</p></li>\n<li><p>Around 1/3 of our participants have a university education.</p></li>\n<li><p>Almost 2/3 of our participants are unemployed, or under-employed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Around 1/5 of our participants have some form of disability or long-term illness - particularly learning difficulties, like Asperger\'s Syndrome (associated with high intelligence) and mental health difficulties, such as depression.</p></li>\n<li><p>1/10 of our participants have a serious problem with housing. Either they\'re homeless, or they are living in insecure, or temporary accommodation.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We had more than 2000 people use the space in 2011, which added up to more than 12000 hours of usage. Helping and facilitating this number of people, particularly when some of them have difficulties, is a huge job.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When it comes to funding, the significance of Access Space\'s budget is how small it is for the outcomes it delivers. </strong>Access Space principally sustains itself by saving money. A typical annual budget is only around \xa3100K. We have survived by raising funds, and by saving money. We save around \xa330000 each year by only using recycled computers and free, open source software. We have a very small core team (now usually 6, now 7 people, mostly part-time) who are on short-term contracts.</p>\n\n<p>Our special power with funding is the huge range of benefits that Access Space brings. We help people:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Make creative progress - by engaging with digital creativity.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make technical progress - learning new high-tech skills.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make social progress - by helping each other, and by working together, people learn crucial soft skills, and develop more useful networks.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make progress with employability and enterprise. (These we see as the ultimate extension of all the types of progress people make.)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This means that we have a<strong> wide range of stakeholders</strong>. We have been funded to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Increase high-tech skills for local enterprises.</p></li>\n<li><p>Get people involved with the digital arts.</p></li>\n<li><p>Help people become "digitally included".</p></li>\n<li><p>Research and test new models for peer learning.</p></li>\n<li><p>Develop and incubate micro-enterprises.</p></li>\n<li><p>Develop high-tech skills with innovation potential.</p></li>\n<li><p>Help people to become included in mainstream society, and become more employable.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What do we want? </strong>Funding, of course! However, we are aware that models based on funding are becoming increasingly under pressure. So we have started a "Friends" scheme, to ask our participants, and anyone else who thinks that the free opportunities we deliver are a good thing, to contribute.</p>\n\n<p>But we also need more participation by people who understand the challenge, and want to help. We want people who are interested to help us facilitate the community, build functioning social and economic networks, and experiment with how we can mobilise the talents and skills of the larger and larger number of unemployed people we encounter.</p>\n\n<p>We realise now that the most valuable technology that is being discarded by our society is PEOPLE. We are seeing talented, skilled people unmobilised, and we think that this is a criminal waste. We also see deeply uninspiring, value-free jobs (like working in call centres) as the only structural answer put forward by mainstream business and industry, and we want people to work with us to develop more inspiring, creative, engaging, and socially valuable jobs as an alternative.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We need:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>More volunteers who are interested to work with a wide range of people, and are interested to challenge social exclusion and division.</p></li>\n<li><p>Enterprising people who are interested in starting their own business and can see the potential to work in a social, creative and technical context.</p></li>\n<li><p>Open source software enthusiasts who want to help us spread the word. We have a number of specific software and hardware challenges which we could use help with.</p></li>\n<li><p>Other spaces across Europe who would like to collaborate with us to develop a network of social, technical and creative spaces. We have contacts already, but many spaces are just "technical and social" or "creative and technical" or "social and creative". We are looking for groups that want to be "technical, social, AND creative".</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This would be the gist of what we\'re doing with this project. If you are passionate about techs and open source software, let me know and maybe we can collaborate. Also, if your\'re around Sheffield and would like to visit our establishment, also drop a line; We\'re currently working with x volunteers, but would be happy to take you in if you\'re up for this!\xa0</p>\n\n<p>Find us at:</p>\n\n<aside class="onebox whitelistedgeneric">\n  <header class="source">\n    <a href="http://access-space.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">access-space.org</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class="onebox-body">\n    <img src="https://i1.wp.com/access-space.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cropped-as-1.png?fit=512%2C512" width="512" height="512" class="thumbnail">\n\n<h3><a href="http://access-space.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Access Space</a></h3>\n\n<p>Making and Unmaking</p>\n\n  </article>\n  <div class="onebox-metadata">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n  <div style="clear: both"></div>\n</aside>\n\n\n<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/accessspace" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.facebook.com/accessspace</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="http://twitter.com/AccessSpace" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://twitter.com/AccessSpace</a></p>\n\n<p>Finally, to see our work in action, I leave you in the company of this video of the Recycle Mid-Weekend we organized in March last year:</p>\n\n<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/31084302" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" title="Now with added pizza! - Timelapse Video of Access Space Mega Recycle Mid-Weekend, March 2011 - V2" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe>\n\n<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/31084302" rel="nofollow noopener">Now with added pizza! - Timelapse Video of Access Space Mega Recycle Mid-Weekend, March 2011 - V2</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/richardbolam" rel="nofollow noopener">Richard Bolam</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Vimeo</a>.</p>', u'post_id': 1710, u'user_id': 14, u'timestamp': u'2012-03-13 19:54:24', u'title': u'Access Space, A New Model for Individual and Community Development'}, {u'content': u'Undisclosed content', u'post_id': 1473, u'user_id': 102, u'timestamp': u'2012-04-23 18:20:40', u'title': u'Undisclosed title'}]
